so when you ask what the two illnesses aretheyre similar in that they tend to have moodiness involved impulsivity and self-damaging behaviors for compensatory measures otherwise theyre not really that similar but they do seem to "like" one another and often show up in the same personmaking their lives chaotic difficult dysfunctional and intense so if your friend is concerned that they may have one (or both) of these illnesses they should not be ashamed its definitely not their fault they should instead get help from a professionaland insist that they are treated appropriately with the correct types of therapy and medication,0
in addition people with bpd quite often have a weak self concept they dont always know who they really are deep down inside they may always feel like theres something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically this can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem they may have a weak value system (or one that is missing entirely) or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have since theres a real issue with trusting and black/white thinking they dont always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to "like" them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally and think that they (themselves) are terrible/bad/evil people for doing it later they often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people a "normal" person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it but its unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible/bad/evil for having made the mistake oftentimes a person with bpd would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failurethat it happened because they (themselves) are awful/bad/wrong this means that their self concept is much more fluid than "normal" people now please keep in mind that not all bpd sufferers have every single one of these symptoms there are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face people with bpd need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them (having a more mature realistic viewpoint of the world that isnt all black or all white) rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing/aberrant build the ability to trust others/self and learn coping mechanisms dbt (dialectic behavioral therapy) was developed for bpd sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives heres the thing too its fairly common for bipolar and bpd to be comorbid in a person (meaning they have both at the same time) we dont necessarily know if theres a genetic link between them but we are beginning to think thats possible a person suffering from both at the same time (untreated) would tend to be extremely emotional moody hypersensitive to criticism untrusting self-damaging with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives (and the lives of those who love them) quite difficult they are chaotic because their brain isnt working correctly due to chemical imbalances and at the same time their perception of themselves other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected they tend to have problems with love relationships friendships family relationships and relationships with coworkers quite often they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania (more often for depression than mania) its not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis (and a good treatment plan) they may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing,0
borderline personality disorder like all other personality disorders is an abnormal way of perceiving and interacting with the world think of it as having a dirty filter that the sufferer sees the world through constantly we do not believe it is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain but its possible that some of the symptoms might because medication *can* help some sufferers (but doesnt help everyone) because they perceive things incorrectly they often react inappropriately to situations that occur people with bpd typically (not always as there is some room for deviation) have problems with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situations that occur they may be perceived by others as being moody and reactive they often have problems with trusting other people its believed this occurs because of unhealthy childhood experiences with parents caregivers teachers and peers however there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have bpd as well regardless they tend to have short-lived intense relationships with lovers where they cling one minute and push away the next they often have issues with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandoned theres a real fear of abandonment and rejection they tend to have black and white thinking (things are all wrong or all good) and that means they often either idealize or villainize their lovers depending on their mood this leaves the lover often feelling like they dont really know whats going on or where they stand in the relationship one minute the lover is being adored and the next they are being pushed away if theres infidelity or other types of self-damaging risky behavior occurring the lover may eventually get fed up because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust quite oftenthe sufferer does cause their lover to leave them this of course reinforces their belief that they will always be abandoned left and/or aloneand the cycle of clinging/pushing away starts again with a new person usually quite soon afterward it should be notedthis black and white thinking tends to color their perception and behavior in regards to themselves their self esteem their self concept and the world around them quite often they are hypersensitive to criticism (or even perceived criticism) this goes back to that deep seeded fear of being rejected or abandoned more than likely they lived in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who wouldone minute seemingly dote on the child and the next without obvious reasonpush the child away inconsistent inattentive cold neglectful or absentee parenting seems to be a big part of the reason a person with bpd may have had it develop since we learn to trust from the first people in our lives (usually our parents)if a parent proves to be untrustworthy absent cold or inconsistent with affection/punishmenta child may learn that they cant trust anyone deep down people with bpd dont always trust themselves either because they tend to have very black and white thinking they dont always handle situations very well this "just world" concept where they seem to think that "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people" can cause them to see themselves as bad/evil/wrong if something bad happens to them even things they cant control in addition they often have feelings of intense anger if things dont go as they expected especially if it deals with other people their expectations of other people are usually unrealistic (because their expectations of themselves and the world are unrealistic generally) they may get physically violent or abusive when things dont go the way they expected during a period of devaluation of their love partner they may become violent or abusive (note: this doesnt happen with every bpd sufferer but it is a common enough occurrence that it should be said) they have intense changes in feelings and react quickly to situations without always thinking things through they can be self-damaging and impulsive this is where people get it confused with bipolar disease because bipolar tends to cause highs and lows and emotional reactivity during those periods people with bpd have this issue all the time howevernot just when they are experiencing a disease relapse from one extreme or the other,0
long answer: bipolar disease is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain it can be treated with medication and therapy typically people with bipolar disease have learned to compensate for it in unhealthy ways (illegal drug use eating disorders gambling promiscuity alcoholism self harm etc) and therapy can assist them with overcoming these unhealthy "coping mechanisms" in addition they may need therapy that assists with rebuilding family relationships that the sufferer (while in a relapse state) has damaged bipolar disease often causes lability of emotional response and potentially self-damaging behaviors that come from that they tend to have periods of mania/hypomania and depression that is severe during mania they may feel like they have more energy be happier (without reason) have grandiose ideas of themself and their abilities need less sleep be much more sexual and engage in risky behaviors without considering the consequences during depression they may be suicidal incapable of caring for themself engage in self-harm have a hard time leaving their house/bed and miss a lot of work depending on what "type" of bipolar a person has (or where they fall on the spectrum) determines quite often how serious their periods of mania/hypomania are and how long those occurand how serious their depressive episodes are and how long those occur regardless its a difficult situation they live with constantly medication typically works to counterbalance the chemical imbalance in their brain (or offset the symptoms) so that they can function somewhat normally without huge highs and lows,1
well think of bipolar as a rollar coaster you have high and low peaks where your mood can either rapidly alternate up and down or have the longwr lasting shifts ups that last for days ect depression and anger are two of the most common now as for borderline personality  its more like a tilt a wirl your moods can go secerap directions and rapidly  impulsivness is a major part of it as well not making sound judgement and just doing not to mention reations to situations that are commonly deemed inappropriate i myself suffer from both and it took me along time to become stable and somedays i still struggle with it,0
believe me i show you much more than anyone i still have lots of work to do but i trust you completely i hope you feel the same you can share anything with me li no worries,0
yes i feel the exact same way my family avoids me all ways/always now i have no place in my family and no voice either i now choose not to give them any info if at all possible all they do now is hurt me and leave me out of all family functions and matters because i am not strong enough this is the time you find your true family and friends facebook has helped me tremendously i will not validate their behavior because it is so stereotypical they choose to remain ignorant,0
i was hospitalized in may for the same reason ive dealt with the loneliness that comes with it unless you know someone who has struggled with it its really hard for others to relate problem is it adds to the emotional mudslide that plagues us i completely understand where you are coming from,0
i feel like that and im hearing you loud okay just a while ago only an hour or so i wás feeling like there was nothing in this world who will ever understand my feelings i caught it and held onto it and felt that if i didnt live it wouldnt matter i felt so hopeless that nobody understands and to understand is to love and if i didnt have love what would i do? die? im too frightened every time i try so its not working death wont work its not our time so what did i love? i love the world and i want to be a part of its healing it doesnt matter if people understand its enough that i do and the very few who know and love me understand the rest dont matter they are the sad ones cos they dont allow their minds to open and to accept that they maybe the ones harming us,0
i had 9 rounds over 35 weeks two years ago it saved my life i have some trouble recalling words i need when im anxious but other than that i have no negative effects without ect i wouldnt be able to be at university now as bipolar had effected my cognitive ability badly - ect reversed that i will definitely go back for more if i go downhill again research shows that ect has an 80% success rate; that is 80% of patients show significant improvement ultimately it is your decision dont be pushed one way or another only you can decide,0
no but i have seriously thought about having it i dont know maybe desperation have discussed it with the psychiatrist off and ondo not know,0
yes i do and its terrifying know matter how i try to explain they see from clear glass mine is cloudy!,0
michelle osullivan yes i just started it in july we are moving very slowly and it takes a lot of getting used to she was the one who suggested i ask my brother to check in on me once in a while but i went about it all the wrong ways and got too emotional then when he told me that he wouldnt tell me what he wanted to say to her i got uncomfortable like i was going to be thrown under the bus and then he got angry and just bit my head off,0
he just upped my anti-depressant last week they arent upping my lithium because the salt makes me constantly thirsty and i am a heart patient and have a fluid restriction ive tried every other drug and theyre either bad for my heart or they have horrible side effects the therapy im learning is supposed to help with bpd but they said it will be really hard and take a lot of time to change my behavior,0
yes ive been seeing psychiatrists for nearly 30 years first just depression then cyclothymia then bipolar and anxiety then bpd,1
my mom is one person who sets me off when im agitated i cant take being around her and even when i tell her im agitated and we should talk another time shell push until i snap and then make me feel guilty about it,0
a family session can be helpful you need to be ready for that though having a family session may allow for them to gain an improved understanding of your symptoms and moods this may also allow for you tho better understand what they are having difficulty with i relating to you not as one weigh mi rather as the family you are you are working already ight sounds like on insight sand awareness keep at it try not tho be discouraged by the actions of other ultimately we are responsible for our own happiness i struggle to with relationships so i appreciate what you are dealing with good luck,0
yes iam like this at times but they seem to wind us up too its not all what we say  but i am careful at times how i speak or i dont speak at all thats easier lol  try and think before we speak but i know when we get stressed its hard and all sorts come tumbling out  stay strong,0
my brother sent me one: do not disturb im disturbed enough already,0
when i told a former employer about my bipolar i felt like he was always nervous that i might fly into a rage at anytime im not even the angry kind of bipolar; im really just the sad kind but since that job ive learned to keep it to myself ive said that ive had a bad cold if i was too depressed to work,0
the only problem i have is when im randomly put on a grave yard shift that means i cant take my meds as they make me so tired i have 2 kids and cant just catch up on my sleep and end up with anxiety and not being able to sleep from not taking my meds being able to have a stable and normal shift all week makes my week 100x better than it would have if all shifts were different and there were random graves,1
my job is just crazy you basically do 5 jobs in one and we put peoples lives on the line so we have to be 100% on our game its just really hard for my brain to bounce from position to position in the same day i feel like i cant keep up and then i get anxious and start talking crap and saying things i dont really mean im just saying them to try to calm down,0
at least you people are on meds i am without its a struggle everyday for me not wanting to live cz i get into these crazy ass episodes and its hard to control but its easy for people that dont have this issue to tell me to fking snap out of it ,0
im a *itch 24/7 and i am not on medication because i have no fking medical insurance for my bipolar depression and anxiety so i have too deal with it myself and people around me i cant stand who i am but i feel stuck like you and hopeless,0
no i am the same way sometimes i cant afford to get my meds refilled and i go off the deep end i feel so bad and my body feels so horable it is not your fault so dont worry just do the best you can,0
no  you are not the only one that suffers from the withdrawals of these damn pills  i too become a totally different person  call this complicated  hard to deal with  very easily annoyed that is created by these big pharmaceutical companies and their man made so called medication when my friends see the slightest bit of my alter ego coming out is when along with the change of myself is when my name changes as well  i then become evilalina  funny yet sad !! dealing with the aftermath of evilalina sometimes puts me into a deeper depressing state of mind i am not this irritate person i transform into which one one the main reason why i choose to medicate myself by medical marijuana  i have also knocked out 3 of my daily pills  since evilalina rarely makes her presence known,0
im awful at remembering to take mine i miss one day and im a mess i miss two and i am completely unable to function anxiety induced rage is so awful,0
im going through this now i bitch myself out and tons of negative self talk because i cant shake the guilt im a miserable person to be around even skipping one or two days id like to think that meds arent helping since i still struggle plenty on them but its when i miss a dose or two that i realize theyre a life saver i wouldnt function very long in a med free state of mind as it is i try to limit my interactions as much as possible so as to limit the stimuli that i will dwell on and beat myself up over i know your struggle all too well,0
no not alone i too have felt the guilt of my non-medicated self i have to stay on meds no skipping,0
no you are not alone if my meds are not properly regulated i have blinding rage outbursts i am cranky & bitchy everything gets on my nerves i yell like a banshee it is horrible you have to stay on top of the meds,1
i def think its way too much but you have to know your own body and by the fact yiur asking you must think so i would talk to my dr and if he wont adjust to your wants then get another we are here to live lofe not be tied and chained to meds and drs! i understand about the sleeping when i got off my meds 2 years ago that was my fear buti researched and tried other thibgs and i now sleep 5-7 hrs a night w nothing! its a daily task but i fewl so much better without all those meds their side effects and staying stressed having to remember to take them throughout the day now life is enjoyable im not just going thru the motions good luck ❤️,0
i too take seroquel it has done wonders for my sleep cycle and i now get the sleep i need i also take a high dose of effexor (antidepressant) and buspar (for anxiety) this combination works well for me and this came to from years of trying other meds that didnt have the desired results i suffer from bipolar 2 severe depression and anxiety the amount of medication seems excessive but maybe you can eliminate some if they arent helping you im not a dr though so make sure you stop and start your meds with drs guidance good luck to you and i hope this helps wishing you peace and happiness,1
its always hard getting a proper diagnosis often there are those who have more than one diagnosis my kids have adhd bipolar with sczophernic tendiciesi myself am bipolar anxiety and ptsd insomnia so i do take a lot of pills i like u have a lot of physical conditions as well for which i take meds the important thing is to let each doctor know what you are taking also be proactive know medicine side effects read up on them it gets confusing but the more u knw about them the more its helps,1
its really just a matter of opinion my therapist today said that theres two sides to depression how you think and the imbalance ive been on seroquel for 8 years and due to insomnia i too only get 2-4 hours of sleep without it which is the leading cause of my issues (depression phobia related anxiety add gad) his way of putting it is that the prescription helps you put on a different pair of glasses until you can handle the sun again on your own i really liked that,1
megan ur medication is more important that u take ur pills they will help u stay strong its not anything more important than taking my pilp i go manic offend and its a struggle for me when im like that i get so depressed that i dont come out of my room for day other then going to the bathroom please thqt u medication,0
i was told to do this and it does work but here is a technique that at psychotherapist should advise you on for it to work i and a fear of dying but it got me through a c-section and i was allowed to keep the band on x,1
what i hate its like holding your breath for the worst to happen while your body is acting crazy giving you danger signals  then the feeling never passes it stays with you horrible torture tormented,0
stress ball maybe,0
you know whats been helping me? a fidget cube it fits in my hand and ive been actually falling asleep with it because thats when my anxiety is the worst idk about the band thing ive never heard of it but im just letting you know the cube helps me especially if you are concerned about self harm,0
its where you put an elastic band (like a rubber band or hair tie) on your wrist and when you start to feel anxious/nervous (or any other bad habit/emotion) you snap the band against your wrist it didnt work for me because i have an extremely high pain tolerance,1
being a partner to someone who has a mental illness must be so hard but the things you describe are true and honest triggers for me its never an excuse its a monster living in his head ive been in relationships where i was treated bad because of my bipolar and anxiety now im married to the most calm and loving man that never makes me feel worse when im having an episode or being triggered by something that seems "ridiculous" im not trying to be shitty but just because you work in mental health doesnt mean youre equipped to live with it at home he just needs your love and acceptance not blame and anger,0
cant you put the animals in crates and close the bedroom door so you guys could sleep together? i know crate training takes time but in the end you will both come to find out the less the animals disturb your sleep the better you both feel,1
firstly you are definately entitled to vent and i can imagine it would be extremely difficult to be in that situation its not fair that you are working so hard and losing sleep and are clearly struggling because youre exhausted can you make different arangements for the animals to sleep maybe in another room or something or maybe you could try a different sleeping arangement i think it would be a good idea to see a psychologist or consellor for yourself as well and try talking to him about how everything is affecting you maybe you could go back to the doctor or a counsellor together to try to find a way to make things work better its great that he has made improvements though,1
has he tried therapy by chance? therapy drained me and i ended up dropping out i was in group therapy but i also have ptsd and severe anxiety along with bp i couldnt take on hearing others traumatic situations anymore it did teach me coping skills and renewed coping skills id forgot i had tho ive never used my illness as an excuse to act out wrongly unfortunately i do still get flustered from time to time and have outbursts (usually over the smallest things) before i can help myself but i try and stop it as soon as i realize it and i own up to it i admit i was wrong and apologize for me its about being very vigilant of myself at all times especially since i dont do pharmaceuticals perhaps therapy and learning such skills could benefit him? im sure he doesnt mean to be that wayits just as exhausting for him as well believe it or not wishing you strength and courage in working thru this ,1
its not fair to resort to "leave him then" all relationships take work and dedication through everything hardships included throw a mental illness into the mix and it gets difficult to the max my husband and i both suffer from mental illness and its an almost daily struggle to not lose our shit but we love each other we are dedicated to each other there are times when it feels like he doesnt understand my predicament and theres times i act like i dont understand his but at the end of the day (or week) our love prevails dont give up and just "leave" when theres enough love and dedication to survive through the storm its not easy but nothing worth having ever is,0
my wife left me about 9 months ago after a 8 year relationship decided to jist pack up and leave on christmas without warning because she couldnt deal with my anxiety and depression it still hurts me but it will get better you have to believe hang in there,1
i have mental illness bipolar bpd ptsd anxiety etc etc and my last girlfriend and i were only together for 3 years she also has bipolar some days were a mess but we loved each other increibly deeply and i loved every min we were together sadly loving someone isnt always enough to save a relationship from ending mental illness doesnt make a person less dateable but it can definitely add challenges <3 have a wonderful weekend peeps !!,0
yah i would coz they might struggle at times but its worth while in the end if you love them then there "illness" shouldnt matter,0
wow i cant even read anymore how insulted i feel reading some of these comments of people so vehemently rejecting those with mental illness wow thank god i found someone who loves me and isnt afraid of me! damn! utterly disappointed in the overall negative view,0
i myself have a mental illness both of my parents have a mental illness i know my fathers mother had several mental illnesses i was married to a man with bipolar and mild schizophrenia my current husband has anxiety but i couldnt go through a spouse with bipolar again even though i have it myself,1
hurtful questionn alot of insensitive comments its not like we can help it so on top of hereditary mental health issuesi have to be forever single? that works wonders on depression n anxiety thanks :(,1
people with mental illness are jus like the next person they jus have to take medicine i have bipolar disorder and anxiety a person learns to cope and people learn to be with them or give up on them,1
yes i can see no reason why not mental illness doesnt equate to danger or misery being an arsehole on the other hand will gauruntee misery,1
of course in fact id rather be i worry about being with someone neurotypical who will either take advantage of me or end up resenting me because they dont understand,0
my boyfriend has bipolar anxiety and anger issues so yes,1
noi suffer from anxietyand clinical depressioni live with itand it would very hard to be involved with someone who has same problem,0
i am in a relationship with my same sex partner which suffers from bipolar myself with depression and anxiety disorder its extremely tedious 90% of the time with the unpredictability of his emotions and my anxiety having a blast off that,1
as somebody with a lot of mental problems of course i would it can be difficult sometimes and it can sometimes be stressful but i believe that if you truly love that person an illness shouldnt stop that,0
shame i thought id married someone kind and gentle but after working non stop ending up taking coke to keep me going i was banned from my house my buisness ended up in jail my choice to try and get help the only one to stand by me was my daughter and she is only 12years old its hurts more than any thing yes i have depression and anxiety but i hid it well broken hearted is a understatement but if i can help anyone going thru the same i would,1
my husband has mental problemsthru no fault of his ownbeen a struggle but we are getting through it day at time ❤,0
i was married to a paranoid schizophrenic unfortunately didnt work out cause were both ill but still great friends,1
my boyfriend and i both struggle with mental illness so when one is down and struggling the other who knows all too well how hard it can be and is the support system i have cptsd and he is agoraphobic with severe anxiety so theyre both very different but we know we can always get through to the other side together,0
well my wife is married to one (i suffer with depression anxiety and probably some other stuff) so id be hypocritical to say no,1
married one had a baby he left it got 100% worse once baby arrived being with someone with a mental illness is incredibly stressful and draining waking up and being on eggshells every day/hour not knowing what mood they will be in is very challenging especially a person who is not willing to accept their diagnosis and will not accept help,0
yes because i suffer from depression/anxiety disorder if i dated anyone "normal" (whatever the hell that is) id be bored,1
doesnt sound like its worth sticking around you need someone one who loves you for who you are what you go through and how hard it is to function im in the same boat with you and am at the point where id be better off alone just havent figured out how to be brave enough to do 8 no love no compassion no empathy i already feel like im living by myself just with a stranger in the house im lonely and scared good luck to you and god!!,0
i guess i would if they could talk about it but myself i dont think im ready for one i tried earlier in the year but her attitude to things didnt help i never told her about my own issues but she belittled other peoples that i just never went back to see her i still have a lot of pain from a long term relationship break up she was unfaithful and untruthful accused me of doing what she was actually doing i couldnt go out alone so i always took one of her kids with me they would tell me she asked if i spoke to any ladies while we was out if i went out with friends and she didnt come next day she would be checking pics on the venue or their fb accounts if she didnt see me i was accused of meeting someone and using the friends as excuse (it was what she was doing)! i guess i still have feelings for her even thought shes drove me down into deep depressive state and im now showing symptoms of social anxiety disorder and paranoia would i want to be with someone like it? im really not sure the normal me is non judgemental compassionate understanding and empathic but the current me is struggling with my own issues im not sure i could cope with another with similar or worse issues!,0
i have bipolar and my husband has severe anxiety we celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary two days ago,1
not everyone is capable of handling the stress of being with someone with a mental illness and thats okay its better to know your limits then put you and the other person in a situation neither can handle it may seem shallow to you nick kemp but its more about being realistic in what you can handle,0
my husband has bad anxiety and is seriously insecure and he also has depression but hes still an amazing husband and father hes kind and funny and sweet and loving and compassionate he never lets me go a day without making sure i know he loves me,0
lovely and in prision for what ???? i suffer with depression anxiety but it dont make me do bad things to end up in jail and cry i hav mental illness,1
i believe it i am 4 years older than my gf and before she was "of age" her mom constantly threatened to get me arrested if i did anything she did not like,1
would depend on what and how badif she were uncontrollably violent may not but to an extent dont we all have some mental illness in us??,1
if you are at all wondering if you should go to the er you probably should its scary and ive done it i have bipolar ii as well and anxiety disorder ive been in behavioural units and youre right a lot of times its hard to even get in i hope you feel better i understand ask yourself if you feel safe if you dont go to the er theyve always treated me so well there,0
make a list!! its so helpful! and no worries on forgetting see them more than once!!!!,0
i worry about what others think as well,0
always make a list that way you wont forget in fact my partner has a meds review tomorrow and i have already written down two questions i need to ask if you struggle to talk take someone whom you can talk to and get them to speak on your behalf i have spoken on my partners behalf for 6 years she expects me to do the right thing by her and that is what i do good luck,0
my anxiety fuels my agitation and rage and that fuels my anxiety it doesnt end just be very honest,1
write everything down you need to tell him this is important for your nerves will make you forget somethings ive done it a lot and the doc needs to hear as much as you can tell him to help you to me remembering im not a doc you have more than depression but thats why you need to write it down a list the list will make you not so scared too,0
yes!!!! write it down make notes talk with the psychiatrist please know it is not a one & done situation you talk to the psy then they assess and there is follow-up please push yourself be sure to share what you need if you find you have forgotten something write it down for the next time you said your "doctor" diagnosed you? if you mean your normal primary care physician they are not qualified to make such a diagnosis and i sincerely hope he is not prescribing meds for the conditions without therapist or psychiatrist input i suffer from both anxiety & depression and was that same person that you describe above please consider seeing a therapist/counselor as well as the psychiatrist this way you get treatment and medication if you need it,1
hey thereyou will do great! i was terrified too and i did make some notes to bring with me but for my assessment they basically went through my history from when i started having trouble so you could make some notes on that esp if youre anxious but in my experience they are very understanding and make you feel at ease you will definitely feel better afterward and they can figure out if your diagnosis is accurate they can also help you learn to control the urges when you understand where they are coming from remember the beginning is the scariest part and youve worked for this appointment youll do fine!!,0
yep! my bf says he only gets 2 good weeks with me the other 2 weeks im an irritable angry bitch sometimes ,0
i have depression and anxiety and it ruined my life,1
yes but you may have pmdd id call your gynecologist or if you dont have one set up an appointment and have him/her diagnose you i have pmdd and bipolar add and anxiety and i get so much worse like you do whenever its time for my period,1
omg my periods used to be a nightmare i was an angry anxious emotional mess until i got the mirena iud it took about 6 months and then my periods stopped and i only have a little spotting sometimes its works by keeping the blood from lining in your uterus the best part is it only releases hormones into your uterus and not thru your bloodstream i used to become suicidal on any other birth control i also tried the copper iud but it made me bleed so bad they had to take it out at the er,1
i have anxiety and depression and i get very moody a week prior,1
i dont have bipolar or bpd but i have add anxiety and depression that im being treated for i used to have that same problem with my cycle that you described it was finally diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoria i was eventually diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (a very common reproductive disorder in women 1 in 10 have it many do not know about it) i was put on medication to treat the pcos and the premenstrual dysphoria pretty much went away if you havent been checked for pcos or other female reproductive problems you might want to look into those i include information about premenstrual dysphoria: ,1
that could be a horror movie!,0
it would be a horror film,0
that would be horrifying i rarely have nice dreams almost always nightmares the higher my stress levels are the more intense and real they seem,0
we would all be very disturbed by what we found,1
i have bipolar depression and anxiety no medication & no fking insurance ,1
anxiety or bipolar dis me ,0
i stress reading this ,0
thanks for starting this thread i am constantly sexually frustrated as i am committed to my partner who says that i am obsessed by sex so im not going to act out but feel like im burning inside sometimes for weeks i hadnt considered it could be symptomatic thanks for sharing all,0
try autism ptsd anxiety bipolar i think ill die twenty years before i should :(,1
yes maybe im manic a little more than others who are bipolar 2 but this has been a long generated problem since before my diagnosis depression and anxiety came long before bipolar 2 i dont really prefer what type of sex it is but there has to be intercourse or its just more depressing and angering 99% of the time if i want someone ill pursue them and im eerily persuasive my sex habits have been nearly deadly but thank god to this day nothing has ever happened or came up positive,0
obsessive behavior and no restraint is fairly common distraction and channeling your feelings into writing art etc might help its just the way your brain chemistry works there is no need to be ashamed just explore and try to understand how you work ,1
my onset was 15 with no adult helping me seek help i was diagnosed bipolar at 25 but not on meds that helped the highs until i was 33 they made me so numb and i took them for 2 yrs i hated the numb but it helped me see what i was doing to myself having sex with strangers was exciting in the moment but left me empty for weeks after the meds completely took away my sex drive and i started valuing my other qualities not just my sexuality im off meds now and i feel a healthier sense of self now then before everyday is a new struggle but im happy to at least feel more in control of my sexuality,1
i have hypersexuality its been a bit better with my pregabalin prescription it takes the edge off for me i go through phases of having a fairly normalish sex drive ( once a day ) which i class as  wanting  and then other phases which my sex drive is absurd  needing  it a few times a day if it dont get it at either stage i get angry upset i watch a lot of porn then i have the rough sex part of it i like being abused in the bedroom but according to the doctor thats a separate issue i have an emotionally damaging childhood the rough of it makes me feel relieved and less tense i guess everyone is different,0
very brave to raise this symptom and for everyone who has posted comments of support its a very real and sometimes very destructive symptom of bipolar and there should be no shame discussing it to everyone here that has shared their experience off it i completely understand and relate to all those who are appalled by the subject and felt the need to comment negatively why not just scroll past if its not relevant to you some of us already feel bad enough for having symptoms we cant control your disgust in the subject is dangerous to those struggling to understand x x,0
im pretty sure your in a manic stage when i was manic i looked at everyone and thought they want me im a christian and i felt so guilty about my thoughts it was my chemicals a brain is an amazing thing just look what humans can do but with that said we are full of our own chemicals so when your chemicals are off in your brain our thoughts are distorted my advice is call your doctor and talk to them god bless im stable now and only want sex with my husband ( i still love sex!!),0
i had no idea this was part of my condition no dr or therapist ever mentioned it they always mention drugs or alcohol but never sex so i was embarrassed to say anything about it thanks to everyone who was open to help others,0
i met a guy 16 years agohe introduced me to bdsm i never looked back ive been on just about all the bp meds nothing helped so i tried to just go with it theres no shame when i stopped trying to live up to societys expectations and met my own needs i felt better i dont care what anyone thinks about my life choices either i stopped trying to hide shit fight and "fix" the way my brain works and embraced it,0
peopletheres a huge difference between a dominant partner and an asshat if they dont make you feel good its wrong if they hurt you and dont stop when promptedthats wrong a true dom wants his sub to be happy and secure there should be no real fear and never let another person hold your freedom that is super wrong,0
i went through about 12 years wanting sex of all kinds thats when i found out i was bi sexual and i went crazy having sex with folk guys and chicks (mainly chicks of course) but since xmas this year ive done it like 3 times its all kinda worn off now which is a shame i miss iti think about it but my fella doesnt wake up,0
i ha e borderline personality disorder and i am a recovering drug addict but the one thing that i continually obsess about is sex constantly especially if its been awhile or it wasnt satisfyingi could spend hours in bed with a woman and some women cant keep up with me the obsession of addiction is always a part of a lot of mental disorder symptoms i amd definitely hyper sexual ive talked to my therapist about it and the only thing she says is that i should find someone who is just as hypersexual as me,0
i have bipolar and my ex girlfriend also had bipolar and she was like this she was a great girlfriend but she wasnt able to be faithful for a second she loved me i have no doubts of it we talked about it a lot but she literally had no control over her sex drive and also one of the possible symptoms of bipolar is inappropriate sexual conduct which i myself am guilty of too at times same as reckless driving for me on my motorcycle it makes me feel moire alive if u know what i mean all u can do is just do what u have been doing and try not to act on it if u can help it and be careful u dont catch a std other than that a little bit of fun never killed anyone =p,1
you know what else sucks? (pun intended) always looking at someone on the street and staring at their package it doesnt matter if its male or female i always look its horrible my husband calls me a meat gazer and laughs about it but its crazy so shaun clark i can totally relate,0
sueanna arnold-folsom nothing wrong with masturbation its normal and relieves stress,0
i work in mental health nurse a common side effect is hypersexuality it nowt b ashamed off n its great you talk about it as we encourage this so u dont feel alone acting on your urges in positive way is great but should never feel guilty there r medication if u feel its over powering to a point its a taking over ya mental health please do talk to ya consultant they will n do understand and a lot of people suffer u arent alone xx,0
when i am in mania mood i cant get enough i actually had multiple affairs that i am not proud of and it caused a divorce i could not control it after i did it i felt so guilty i would cry and just lay in bed depressed,0
anadrolyesthe anabolic steroiddid wonders for me aside from building lean muscle and cutting the fat in the waist areagoing on the 8 week of hard training and taking anadroli masturbated or had sex once a day after going off anadrol and while my body started producing testosterone againi kinda found a safe and centered spot where i neither had erectile disfunctionor overkill sex drive again im on lyricalorazepamezoloft and onzapineborderline bipolar and a petsistent anxious depression patient these meds(hello pfizer) do it for meso there,1
but nobody ever talks about hypersexuality as a symptom mostly out of shame,0
when im bad i can masturbate up to 8 times a day and the more i cum the more shame i feel to the point im just depressed like when im in a healthy state of mind its once or twice a day but hypersexuality can be rough luckily the meds im on stave off a lot of those pesky side effects otherwise id be staring at asses and crotches all day unable to think about anything but whats under the clothes,0
horrible it is i could really do with one now but i cant and im getting annoyed with my self,0
yeah the guilt is horrible i mastubate at least 4 times a day if i can and im really guilty i just dont know why we get this feeling x,0
oh my gosh the guilt??? whenever i masturbate i get this guilty feeling in my gut like a depressive heaviness comes over me i cant stand that!!! why does this hapoen???,0
i did took too many risks but not now settled and got kids so i can control that side i kinda just relive myself and then feel guilty,0
oh wow me too im on 2 bipolar med and 1 anxiety and i still have sexual urges all the time but not as bad as when i was single at least im not promiscuous anymore i took too many chances back in the day im just glad im not having to deal with consequences like hivrealky lucky,0
thats the bloody problem is finding the right meds im on one for bi polar and one for social anxiety and the socal anxiety ones are like bloody sex pills to mee,1
or the time i had sex in the living room with a marine and all of a sudden the lights came on and i realized he was filming it ive never been so worried in my life and that was nearly 30 years ago,0
i have not been diagnosed with bipolar but this post really got my attention sounds like me and i worry when i cant control it can i ask what your first symptom to get you the bipolar diagnosis people can be addicted to sex but i too am curious of peoples thoughts on this post,0
star honey my temper definitely has changed years ago i use to get so angry not sure what changed it but i dont get as angry but i do find myself annoyed by the smallest things and yell at my kids and later regret it i am on meds for depression for anxiety my sex drive has lessened some but it seems once i find the right guy it seems to trigger the bad part again ugh thanks for sharing,1
i have never needed to really use meds to control my hyper sexuality thought i should expand i use thought censoring during certain situations and thats about it otherwise i allow myself to indulge safely in what my body craves maybe its because i have never viewed sex like most of society does from what most people respond like its not something to be ashamed of and not talking about issues like hyper sexuality just screw people up more of course be careful with whatever you choose to do but its ultimately your choice just practice safety in all forms ^^,0
all the people complaining about this does not understand and are most likely fakers looking for attention this is a real medical condition and judging someone due to having bi-polar sex drive is horrid you need to leave not the people looking for help or information,0
it was myself who asked for the post sorry but im really struggling atm and this was the first place i could think about asking as you all well know opening up is hard no pun intended,0
hey its completely ok that you feel this way if you are in a relationship talk to your partner about your wants and needs in bed and talk to your counselor or dr if you are truly worried about it,0
dont worry shaun its normal my partner suffers the same way and sadly my medication turns off my libido but if you have an understand in partner you can work everything out in the end its totally normal and you shouldnt be ashamed also wanting abuse in the bedroom is purely a bdsm fetish and again many many many people are into that sort of thing as long as it is done in a safe sane and consensual way and your mental health is looked after during the process then its perfectly fine to want that ,0
i go through this when im in mania its insatiable when im not in mania i dont want to be touched one extreme to the other the abuse part is most likely a fetish some people desire it nothing to be ashamed of this is an open group so i feel anything can be discussed and you should expect triggers whats the point of the page if you cant talk about the problems defeats the purpose pay no mind to anyone judging you we get that enough from society and shouldnt have to worry about it here good luck!,0
i understand that it may sound weird but i hope that is a real thing because im a worrier and question everything while my bipolar diagnosis fits especially when i looked at my behavior leading up to the diagnosis it also worries me that they were wrong and im just a horny pervert ya know so either way whether the hypersexuality due to bipolar or a sex addiction at least i would know im not alone and that i can get help,0
interesting article now my question is can you have sex drive addiction and not be bipolar this is very real to me and i scare myself at times with the risky behaviors,1
it actually affects my entire body when i dont get it ill have body spasms and cramps it kinda feels like a female version of blue balls with no way to relieve it i go into rages if my bf doesnt want to have sex and harm myself to try and get something out and even with sex it doesnt work all the time it feels nice but it doesnt relieve the ache/pressure no matter how many times we do it it seems to have gotten worse as ive aged im always either thinking about sex or death or a mixture of the two,0
wendy mcmaster i only copied what the person wrote i have many fetishes but wanting to be beaten to the point of death would definitely qualify as abuse to me and that is something i struggle with lol,0
havent been diagnosed bipolar yet but they are looking at it i am like both of you and struggle to control it i dont have any sexually driven partners so its just a lot of self care and sexual frustration,0
gosh i felt sooo uncomfortable talking to my doctor about this part of it but it not just me! i go in waves and have hyper sexual times but the worst part is i make bad decisions when this happens talking about it helps and yes it is normal for us that have this as part of our disorder liking it rough and wanting marks to be left by your partner is something i enjoy looking at after the fact when hes not around rough but not abuse so perhaps she just misspoke of her desire,1
i love taking risks tho thats the problem i wouldnt cheat as i adore my partner but the temptation is all to real,0
i do risky behaviors when im manic the goal is to have less manic episodes but u gotta find a medicine that wirks,0
change is uncomfortable even if its for the best i had to learn that when staying hurts more than leaving then youre ready to go even when you question yourself good luck to you,0
go! you sound like you have planned and are sensible many people in abusive situations never leave or repeat the situations again and again you are becoming an adult and it seems as though you want to break the cycle be proud of yourself! dont give in to doubt! dont give in to fear! your next step is the hardest but you can do it we all have faith in you and wish you the very best!!! live your life - your parents have chosen theirs and their choices are not in your best interest live your life and make it worthwhile heck i dont even know you and i am proud of you for standing up for yourself and achieving what you have done and setting yourself up for the next step - now lift that foot up and go!,0
you are afraid because you grew up afraid when parents put fear in their children they are scared to do anythingeven breathe you also may be scared of hurting them but if they are hurting you you need to go its the first step in a new beginning do whats best for you you have to take care of yourself because nobody else will,1
sounds to me like you have weighed your options and know what is best for you also you have a support system with your boss and friends and that is going to be key during this time dont listen to the feelings when you are alone and scared just remember that you are growing and you are changing and you dont want the life you have lived to happen again and you know in your heart of hearts that if you stay it will get that way again go you have a life to lead and live i will be praying for you and i know with your support system you can make it,0
i left my abusive home life 2weeks before i was 17 i called the cops myself as i was leaving to make sure i could legally leave and everything however the adults involved did report that i "ranaway" so we went to court i brought my best friend who helped me move and was victim to vial threats made during the move and i brought the adult who was making sure i kept my act together - he had served over seas twice the judge heard both sides then i swear to you he looked at the adults i left and laughed and told them they were stupid and he told me to go continue my new life **i also did not drive nor have a job ** so dont let anyone tell you you that you deserve to be beat or mentaly or emotional (god forbid sexually) abused its scary and hard but you can do it,0
feeling vulnerable at home is a common but unhealthy response to a toxic  abusive relationship take another supportive adult ( witness ) with you loudly invite them into the house so family hears it dont whisper be bold explain that you are leaving and taking only your things explain that you have discussed this with police and can call them to the house should it be necessary explain that you refrained from reporting the "hit" and can do so now if the need arises explain the jail time if you report and press charges practice saying all this numerous times in short concise sentences then quickly grab your stuff and go no discussion have a business card for a point of contact with police i am a firefighter and have done this for others before best of luck god bless,0
the comments im seeing on here are horrific im going to report some of these people to the admins they already removed someone yesterday you are scared because you are young and this is the life you are used to but you are doing the right thing for yourself you have to make yourself #1 in this situation-- called self-preservation i had to do it too but i was much older than you are yes it is scary but you are so smart and doing all the right things-- and youre lucky you have so many people in your corner dont stay there-- it is not a healthy environment for you keep moving forward and hang in there!,0
even if you mentioned she hit you without proof they would not have been able to do anything i spent years in the exact same situation when i got tired of it and took off my mom did report me as a runaway to save face with the rest of the family they ended up helping her get me back in her house be prepared for anything is the only reason i tell you this i hope things go well and if you need encouragement and help there are peoplemake sure you know that when youre home and scared even strangers like us are only a message away,0
those feelings are normal you are scared and feel alone those will pass i hope all goes well for you,0
tip: dont listen to your feelings when you are alone and scared sometimes we have to ignore our feelings and do what we know is best for us feelings can be sorted through and resolved once we are safe and feeling secure hang tough just go dont think just go,0
just goo baby dnt feel guilty about growing keep on keepin on you got this!! only the toughest people go through the hardest battles shine bright sunshine,0
im so sorry your having to go thru this you seem very mature for your age and have researched and planned it well we are supposed to be able to rely on family but some cases it just isnt thstvway and you must look out for yourself and your own pyhsical and mental well being and dont feel guilty for that! you deserve to be happy! and if you have a plan then go for it all the laws and stuff you billeted you are very right my son ran away at 17 and it was that way w the law however he ran away bc he was using drugs and i was on a mission to keep him clean there are so many good people in this world i hope you find ones along your journey to help you! good luck and lots of prayers! ❤️,0
i was in a similar situation and i let the cops arrest my mom even though it helped me it never changed her and made things very stressful on me if i had to do it over i would have just left dont let the negative effect you no matter the age take your life into your hands,0
dont feel bad guilty or scared its no good for you where you are i hope you do this amd start a new life for your self good luck xxx,0
omg thats definitely me all day every day  its a daily struggle,0
do you have situations i call them records that keep playing a life experience in your head and you cant control the records do they make you cry or freeze or throw you into anxiety or panic? also do you have to keep the same doctor sometimes freash eyes see more,1
ok i am battling itovercame ptsd in time after 9/11 still battling depression/manic behavior (im great at bars!)  after another heart attack--which triggered deep anger and depression--drank for 3 weeksmet today with a great psychologist and am seeking to mendconvinced ill never know love again after losing my entire family but still think perhaps i have something to giveto someone while being totally afraid of falling in love again and being hurt againone step at a time,0
i have bipolar ii gad sad bpd ptsd and mdd being borderline sucks that combined with my anxiety makes the worthlessness seem even more scary,1
i have ptsd anxiety and antisocial personality disorder it took years to get me on the right meds but i seem to have more good days than bad now its hard to manage all 3,1
i was diagnosed with ptsd some yrs back it comes and goes  its mentally traumatic i was in a dv relationship for years but the trauma stays  i have no trust in people i question and over think things to where i get depressed i used to hurt myself cuz i felt hate on myself and tried ending my life several times  i never took meds for this because i was afraid i might do something dumb  so ive learned with therapy to overcome gradually this traumatic mental illness,0
i have seen therapist psychiatrist psychologist s all manner of counseling md  been in six mental facility s taken lists of meds so long i cant begin to list them got so sick and damn tired of repeating and repeating my life story to strangers i just quit the day my twenty three year old beautiful daughter died after a hospital stay of only four days  its like my head just went numb and my eyes got tunneled and i could hold only one thought shes gone and she left behind a 2 year old a 3 year old and a 5 year old i walked threw a week of going over my journals that i have written since i was old enough to know my alfabet and decided right thenfuck the professional head squeezers nothing up to that point was ever going to chemically balance my brain not even electro shock treatments could erase my history because they tried i had 51 years of hell that brought me to the most hellish day of my life losing my daughter everyone who knew me thought i would kill myself not once in all my abused life did it ever occur to me to ever take my own life it didnt occur to me then and still doesnt today i am 56 and a half years old in all the horrifying days since my birth from every page of every journal i ever wrote their was palpable anger as my only emotion i take the drug rispedol to control my anger i have taken it for at least 28 years maybe 30 i get 10 of the lowest does xanex they make and sometimes i might have to take them all in a month sometimes only one or two if i blow out a panic attack and i get sixty 75 norco pain pills a month for sever reahmatoid arthritis in the cold set nasty months i use them all every month and still cry all night from pain but the moral to this shitty life is this the day my beautiful daughter died in a mental hospital thru their carelessness because they " accidentally " overdosed her on her fourth dayat that moment in time i was on 13 pills three times a day for every freaking mental condition all these idiot docs could come up with when all i really needed was control i do not by any means reccommed you stop seeing your so called mental health provider but i beg you look at your own life go back to your earliest memory write yourself an honest account of your life if you like me have kept journals go back highlight the events that caused you pain made you mad or gave you emmence grief ask yourself for every event you highlight what was going threw your mind at that moment mental and physical pain most of all dont just write down the pain you felt at any given momentwrite down what you wanted to do at that moment the seconds minutes hours day weeks months years of your torment were you suicideal or homicidal did you want to disapper what were you feeling at that moment you wanted to live for sure you wanted to live or you would not have then highlight after that threat of life and death was over what did you want to do after the event that you just survived and you deal with that issue cause let me tell you knowyou cant forget fuck forgiveness thats not possible no matter what they tell you because you cant forget fuck labels they just give it all a new name for every drug they give you there is no closure because there is no door that can be closed thats going to make you forget deal only with what keeps you from living and understand this one freaking rule of life we are born we survive until we die nobody gives a shit what our real sufferings are because they feel we dont care about theirs labels mean shit not shit! and folks writing scripts care less than anyone cause they have heard it all to the point they feel nothing but the money they get paid to pretend an interest in you theres the truth right there,0
yes you can be tested its a very long test as well some additional questions that get asked to go with it i know bc i was ordered to take them and thats how i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder anxiety depression and ptsd,1
jot down what you are struggling with and take it with you it helps,1
my dr says its anxiety but i feel more like is have agoraphobia too its hard to figure out,0
i go to my therapist on thursday and i wanna see if i can have a test ran to see if i have social anxiety as well because i dont do well with change and when i meet new ppl im distance until i get to know them,1
there is no "test" for social anxiety,1
i have anxiety disorder i got diagnosed last month,1
exercise!!! or just take a daily walk bike ride!!! i was once where u r i got severe depression bipolar 17 year old severe brain injuryi at a time thought i really dont was to have to live on medication where id always end up with totally negative consequences by not staying on drs plan thankfully today i freaking accept my life issues an do believe in taking medsnow the therapist has deffinately been recommended but that i just cant find a way to go about thatmaybe you could give me some insite? like ive gone before with never really moving forward i always start off by brining up my pastthen that brings back all those feelings an my depression finds its way to the top i do feel and want help i myself have doubts as well but i promise exercise will bring the great feeling of life to you,0
im really struggling with out meds  i did start seeing a new therapist,0
try not to put to much pressure on yourself these dark times sometimes take a bit to get through you will comeout the other side baby steps dont set huge goals work towards being g m3d if that is something you are able to do you are strong,1
have your md check your thyroid including t3 and thyroid antibodies dont let them just check tsh and t4 autoimmune hypothyroidism is common in women and also occurs after giving birth it can cause depression and fatigue also have you doc check for the mthfr mutation if you have it you may need methylated b-vitamins because you body cant use the normal ones very well b vitamins are important to the nervous system google both these things and decide for yourself,1
ive been on allergy shots when younger then meds since teen years along w a prescription asthma inhaler 9 mo ago after 2 rounds of antibiotics and $100 worth of otc drugs i was still suffering i was desperate i tried essential oils its 9 mo later and i do not use meds for anything my allergies/asthma/headaches are all controlled naturally witjout the side effects that meds have we are too quick to reach for quick fixes instead of learning our bodies and being preventive,1
i tried without meds and ended up in the mental health ward not a pretty place horrible staff and even worse food they take away your phone and you get fresh air 3 times a day the beds are horrible and you end up on more meds than you went in with if youre lucky you see a psychiatrist once a week and no councilling please reconsider taking meds depression just doesnt go away it sits in the back of your mind like people say you cant snap out of it it takes time meds and support,0
lifestyle changes can also work! i wish soneone would have given me that option before filling me up w meds that caused so many side effects what we eat is sooooo important bc food turns to chenicals and chenicals are what control the mind i was also told the only way to control my anxiety was medswrong! exercise does way more than meds did and without more side effects yes i sgree sometines people need meds to reboot but not for a perm solution,1
im sorry you had such a bad experience mine was different staff was fantastic i went home on fewer meds than i went in with they didnt want us on phones so that we would be present in the healing process - it was a way to sever ties with outside stressors and provide a safe space the food was decent we had appointments with a nurse a social worker and a psychiatrist daily as well as group we wore street clothes not hospital gowns (laces and strings in hoodies removed no belts or scarves) but we didnt get fresh air if anyone besides kalissa reads this please know that experiences differ by hospital and it may not be an awful experience each program is different i actually miss my time there,0
have a chat with your dr and a psychologist there are some fantastic self help treatments you can try that can really help sometimes in my case i used positive affirmations to change the negative nasty comments id be thinking about myself and it felt wrong and uncomfortable at first but i made a conscious effort to always pay attention to the thoughts that were going through my head and everytime a negative one came id stop myself and force myself to think something positive instead it took awhile but it definately helped and my mind became used to thinking the positive thoughts rather than the negative ☺,1
i agree take the meds i tried without and believe me it does not work i was very stubborn and it took quite a few years to realise my stupidity you are a better mam if youre a relaxed mam i ended up being a single mam after my husband left us my son was 6 i used to plan stuff to do all the time so he was never bored and we had a great time together made some very good memories by making plans it makes you get on with it its very difficult to pull yourself together and do it but by planning it gives you time to psych yourself up i didnt want to let my son down and thats what kept me going and believe me meds give you the crutch to help there is no shame in needing help so give it some thought and try to go for it x,1
the best advice i can give you is to always be honest with people about how you feel and what your thinking they are looking out for your beat interest and will need to know what your needs are on your worst day and your best days  never be afraid to need help it is not a bother to ask questions or seek advice ,0
sorry for sounding thick neil sandy but if you cant walk how do you answer the door you know i am a carer for my partner who has bipolar and i suffer with severe depression and on my worst days wont even get out of bed for days or feed us as i do all the cooking my partner cant cook and she is a danger to herself if she tried to cook anything eg: she put a tin of soup in the microwave to heat it i wont speak to anyone and so how would i be able to portray that my partner has no maths skills and cannot budget for anything i pay all the bills do the shopping in fact i do everything tbh when that day arrives which is coming soon i have bought my rope and will leave this life as the stress of all this is slowly killing me anyway to be plunged into debt because my esa and partners dla is stopped i cant do this at all sorry if this has detracted from original post really i am,0
i had pip on my mental status and was totally embarrassedyou have to portray yourself on your worse daythey come to check every part of the form you filled in x,0
the most important thing is to portray yourself on your worst day so if you cant walk at all on those days then tomorrow you dont walk the people who come out are nice and will help you you only need 12 out of 24 points to get full mobility component pip sounds scary for some but its actually more basic and for those who are disabled it will pay out,0
i am so glad people are finally understanding this as it absolute truth and there is nothing to be ashamed of!!!!,0
theres other things to worry about then small words i have no problem with it and dont see why anyone would people make a fuss out of such little things build a statue of the word "bae" and god knows someones gonna get offended,0
thats literally how i feel most days im struggling with medical issues as well and my self esteem is very low and my self confidence is low i have so much self hate and hidden insecurities  i fight a daily inner battle  i fight every day not to kill myself although everything in me screams just end it cuz no one would miss me cuz im worthless stupid and ugly  i feel so hopeless and empty and alone lonley and broken  dealing with my intense depression and anxiety is a nightmare  the hurt pain and sadness and sorrow and despair never goes away but i hide my emotions so well most ppl would never know im struggling so bad  i hide behind a mask  i fake so many smiles and laughs  im just tired im pretending im happy and ok,0
anxiety too,1
i internalize everything to avoid issues but in the end i end up hurt,0
yupthats meid crawl through broken glass to avoid conflict ,0
well this was took the words right out of my mouth  definitely describes me  story of my life how i feel every day im feeling so much hurt pain sadness sorrow and despair but i wear a mask so its all hidden  i pretend im ok and i pretend im strong but inside im struggling and need help behind my fake smile and phony laughter and behind my sarcasm and sass and attitude and anger im fighting an inner battle that no one sees,0
i have a memory of the bathroom in the house i grew up in being white and freezing and i hated it so much i avoided using it at night it was actually blue they think i experienced some trauma that ive repressed then again the trauma couldve been that it was on the windy side of the house so cold theres lots of reasons for false memories but trauma is a biggie for them,0
i have just say its day to day things that i struggle with im not sure if its the lamotragine memory issues or more than that but i can genuinely argue for or against whatever it is the person is saying to me and it turns out im completely wrong but id be 100% sure i thought i was right from my memory its really starting to upset me and start questioning everything,0
is there an admin that can remove this brigitte person? people here dont need to be attacked for asking for help this is why so many people are afraid to speak up sad we all need to support one another,0
there are things that have happened in my life which im positive are memories but when ive asked others that were supposedly there they say no some of these "false memories" are so vivid that im positive that i experienced them but its amazing what the mind can convince you of it makes you question your memory on anything and everything its horrible,0
are they real or are people telling you theyre not real? just asking because i know someone who thinks their memories are real and they are horrific i would never imagine anyone going through these situations and they are so real to this person theyve found peace with god over the horrific situations however they still struggle daily,0
also dont made the mistake i did last month and quit during a panic attack,1
u are not alone id stick it out if you can just having to educate s new co working group is s ton of stress in its self in my opinion no one is going to take it good heck most of our friends and family dont ,0
im just scared because the nature of my job is fairly dangerous and i dont want them to come back and say im not fit for the job ive been doing the same thing at other companies for 2 years and its my passion i dont want to lose my job there are no other options in that industry ive gone through them all,0
if ppl do stop meds good to reduce slowly and make sure ur life is stable/ stress free,1
retake your medication the side affects of these tablets are horrible i accidently never took priadel (lithium) for a few days the pain thoughts and withdrawal was not nice i knew its the tablets and got through it with help from my family im never stopping priadel ever unless the doctor says,0
you need to relax/ stay away from stress / try a massage / exercise whatever helps you i like lavender oil u can deal with a fair bit / dont panic bout if a relapse is coming it prob isnt but if serious symptoms start then get help ps quetiapine v good for helping u relax sleep : short term use x,1
yes it whats happens itll pass but the dreams are bizare ive seen myself in my own dream when i stopped taking risperdal i had dreams that were scary and fucked up mean you shouldnt see yourself fall on piece of glass as it goes through your neck as you bleed out in front of the glass in front off you,1
i took myself off of my adhd meds in 2001 i cant take antidepressants or antianxiety meds because i have severely bad side effects i live with depression and my anxiety attacks (chest pains and panic attacks) because i dont know any way of coping or what i can take for them ive tried seeing a psychologist but talking about my problems only brought back the memories that brought this burden upon me in some ways it seems that my depressed state drives people away from me to where they dont want to hang out or socialize with me which leads me to become more depressed and angry controlling my temper is very hard at times and i just cant help myself ive had thoughts of suicide but i dont have it in me to go through with it it would hurt a lot of people but as i continue living i am the one with mental pain people act or seem like they dont care or miss me im sure if i just up and died they would think a lot differently to the ones who dont talk to me they may see me and say they recognize me but they will not know me for i will have changed every day i feel like im drifting further away from people and with less contact i feel its not going to get any better,0
i got news:they will not give you the meds you need when youre preggo!!the most theyre willing to go is a low dose of zoloft or prozac!nobody in my town would give me medsno matter how much i begged and cried!i had to be hospitalized several times during my pregnancy for suicidal thoughts(gave birth 7 months ago)let me tell youit was the worstmost horrifying pregnancy ive ever had!!it was a never ending nightmare i couldnt wake up out of!!i wouldnt wish that misery on my worst enemy!!!im warning you!!if you are anything like mehave been taking meds since a small childand cannot live without themdont do it!!you are in for a hellish 9 months!!,0
that is a horrible experience!! i was fine with both my kids during pregnancy not medicated!!! i felt very great actuallybut its the after birth that i have a hard time with! my doctor is putting me on meds while i am pregnant so i dont go low or high!!!,0
yes i would talk with your psychiatrist if u r wanting to have another one we are working on one and i got all my meds slowly tapered off due to the risks,1
talk your psychiatrist there are medicines that are ok mine kept me on my serequel cuz the benefits outweigh the risks they just kept an eye on everything if you want another baby you go girl,0
i tried it and i dont want to scare you or assume youre like me but i got pregnant a few years ago i have bipolar ii and generalized anxiety disorder there are some meds you can take when youre pregnant but its not the same and in my opinion may not be healthy for a baby i couldnt handle the pregnancy approved meds they did nothing for me i became so suicidal that i knew i might kill myself even pregnant ill be brutally honest i ended up getting an abortion ill never get pregnant again it wasnt safe for me or the baby im not judging what you feel is right thats just my story and how hard that was on me on every level,1
i would advise a reasonable gap between kids to make things easier two small kids at home would be v stressful care plans much better these days an epidural helped me a lot to avoid stress/ pain which was a trigger for me you need to organise help after the baby ie at night if breastfeeding interferes with medication then dont do it i had quetiapine which helped me relax after birth and sleep which is v important ur case may be different as long as you know ur triggers / patterns but it is manageable so dont worry i was v high risk and this worked along with prayer ,1
if you dont feel ready you shouldnt feel pressured into getting pregnant again he shouldnt expect you to either,0
im also bipolar severe depression anxiety also have tourette syndrome im currently off medication to try and start a family its no walk in the park you have to take everything min by min but im hoping it will be for the best i hope all works out,1
can i ask what meds your on? i have bipolar type 2 ptsd adhd anxiety and struggling bad,1
i am 23 weeks pregnant and doing very well without medicationmy psychiatrist told me i will be fine and i started worrying about after birth and a lady from this group told me not to worry about that now and that she managed to be off meds 9months after birthso now im trying to enjoy my pregnancyi will chat to my psychiatrist closer to deliver for my option coz i wanna breastfeed,1
you should go see a doctor dont be scared you need the help its okay your not alone,1
bipolar heightens your senses especially hearing if you cant turn those things off get some ear plugs and go to a quiet room sometimes the noise bothering me is the first symptom i have of a hypomanic phase i know its awful try asking regular doctor for a referral of someone to go to sometimes they know who the good ones are its nothing to be scared of and youll be helping yourself and will feel so much better once youre on medication good luck and hang in there,0
i am sorry about the situation your in i would not have anxiety about seeing a doc they are there to help i have been treated for bi polar anxiety ptsd and adhd for over 20 years there are so many medications possible they can give you no one could tell you but you will feel better and dont be afraid of being told your bi polar and you hear all these assign stories of what other bi polar people have done its not you try to relax in a quite place and get some help so you dont feel this way,1
treatments come in many forms dont be scared i used to be on a multitude of meds and now i only take 3 1 temazepam for sleep 5 mg ativan as needed for anxiety and o e pain pill for my fibromyalvia and arthritis but i was very unstable for yes so i no longer drink alcohol and try to eat healthy exercise and stay away from emotionally toxic situztions,1
my friend and i take venlafaxine and its pretty helpful and dont be scared of your doc theyre there to help u just tell them the truth u will be ok all the best ❤️,0
please go see a doctor immediately and if one isnt available as soon as possible then admit yourself into the nearest psychiatric hospital you can find i understand your reservations and fears but trust me if you wait until its too late you will be very sorry when i first went manic in 2013 it took less than 2 months for me to have a psychotic break i ended up with legal trouble busting my teeth and ruining my life for years to come simply because i refused to take medicine please seek professional help immediately you are not alone and you dont need to feel hopeless and suicidal sending love and positive vibes take care of yourself because in the end no one can do it for us we all have go through it it passes and gets better not instantaneously and there will always be lows and issues to conquer but every battle we face just makes us stronger dont give up and seek help,0
quatiapine olazapine or lithium i take quatiapine for bipolar 100mg twice a day and 3 diazapam a day for anxiety aswell and helps alot,1
dont be scared go to the doctor they will help you i was the same way but i finally just couldnt cope by myself as long as i stay on my meds i feel so much better i do have some bad days still but not as bad especially with gods help also i will pray for you i care about you and know exactly how you feel if you ever need to talk just ask,0
pharmaceuticals not goodmarijuana so much better been on 5-6 antidepressants/anxiety all they do is make your brain foggy and some are very addictive! pot has been a lifesaver for me,1
no thats bullshit marijuana is just like any other psychotropic drug - pharmaceuticals included it can work well for some people and horribly for others just because something works or doesnt work for you doesnt mean it will work or not work for others,1
i have borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and freaking generalized anxiety disorder phew never said all that out loud to anyone but doctors its exhausting but you can be ok theres no magic pill (i waited for a long time) and you have to force yourself to think differently (im not to good at that yet) but theres other people who are like you and theres people who will listen and care i cried my entire first visit to a therapist but you need it trust me :) its scary but worth it,1
all medications require you to see a dr the longer you leave it the worse your symptoms are going to be you just have to push through your anxiety and make the step to see a dr,1
go to the dr i suffered with anxiety and depression for years finally got help,1
exactly what i was thinking im bpd generalized and social anxiety ptsd etc was at one time on 11 meds and am now on none,1
i understand your pain i just found out a few months ago i have bipolar also i have been all my life i thought i just had ocd panic and anixety attacks but now i find out i have pstd and bipolar too all these years i have been on the wrong meds and it was making my bipolar worse,1
you really need to see a doctor no matter how scared you are we all get scared and anxious it would also be helpful to see a therapist hoping you feel better soon ❤,1
thats horrible i cant help but think youre better off for it thoughfor sure thats the kind of perpetuating ignorance i just dont understand,0
please goto a doctor dont be scared they wont hurt you they will help you can understand you a lot better they will listen to you and will try to help you out give yourself a chance self medication wont help you go for a professional treatment,1
dont be scared to go to doctor there are lots of help they can give you yoga exercise meditation getting lost in a hobby helps also but a doctor should be a first real step in helping,1
please seek medical help we only get 1 life  i suffer anxiety and depression since my hubbys suicide please dont be a statistic like he is ,1
dont be scared it seems scary at first but take one thing at a time you do need to go see the doctor though he will prescribe the right meds dnt get discouraged keep fighting,1
ill go ahead and break my own anonymity by writing my experience above im not trying to say my life is perfect or that i dont have bad times but through med management and positive people and activities and therapy ive found things are much better i still have suicidal thoughts when things get bad but not to the point of obsessing about it any more i still make bad decisions but things are so much better than how they were and i know that no matter how bad it gets that the bad days will pass and i can go back to being content with my life,0
i disagree with this statement i was raised right but it itsnt my mothers fault if i was diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety sometimes i lose my temper almost everyday dealing with ignorant people that do not understand what others go through without medication without insurance and no doctors its a struggle point blank i was raised by the greatest mother ever rip ,1
actually how you were raised has nothing to do with any of that some people had horrible parents and are good people some people have good loving parents and are bad people adults think for themselves and make their own decisions,0
its not about being stupid because you walk away it can be really hard to stay when you have tried everything i have supported my partner every single day for nearly 6 years i have struggled with my own mental health for over 45 years with numerous suicide attempts 1 since we met i am 53 my partner is 29 never assume that someone is stupid it could be that you have done all that you can?,0
thats every night  for those who judge fine by me but if you have a kid growing up and his/her life begins to change well after puberty wish your judgementel ass the best!! not a day or night goes by that in someway bending me bipolaranxietymanic and god depression sits in days to weeksweeks to many months before any relief!! judge on!!,1
fools dont want to meet reality they are afraid to face the truth pwe hypocrite,0
ortho tri-cyclen lo was my favorite until my insurance decided not to cover it all of a sudden after taking it for almost 8 years but my new one is lutera and i love it and im on meds for depression ptsd anxiety panic disorder and insomnia,1
i use a mirena the estrogen in most birth controls sends me into wild mood swings mirena is progesterone and my body handles it better i have ptsd anxiety major depression and they are tracking my moods to determine bipolar i hope this helps,1
loester 24 i have the least amount of hormonal swings and have no side effects bipolar anxiety and depression is what im treated for the nuvaring also worked well,1
yeah nexplanon like depo have the same hormones and they have no estrogen so they shouldnt have many side effects i think the only side effect for me was lack of sex drive it didnt bother my depression or anxiety at all,1
talk to your doctor? i doubt any of us are medically qualified to give proper advice,1
i have bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd im on the pill used to be depo,1
talk to your doctor i have depression and anxiety been on logynon ed for quite a few years now and never had any problems i was lucky in the sense that this was the 2nd pill i tried so i didnt have to go through countless prescriptions to find the right pill for me,1
nuvaring im bipolar type 2 n intense anxiety and its great for me and been on it years,1
i used to take the pill to prevent migraines and heavy bleeding i struggle with taking my meds on time because of my depression i recently talked to my gyno about this and she suggested that i switch to mirena which is an iud that also has a low dose of progestin so far it has worked wonders i dont have to worry about forgetting to take my pill and my periods have basically stopped i have spotting for a week every couple of months but thats it good luck i hope you find something that works for you,1
i struggled with this concern as well i didnt want something that was going to throw off the balance of my meds once a month i talked in depth with my doctor about it as we agreed on the iud (mirena) it has the least amount of hormones with the best success rate for what i was specifically looking for i have had three now (one after each child and then got it replaced when the 5 yrs was up) i have had very little issue with it best of luck my friend,0
nuvaring! it was my favorite and im also bipolar with ptsd anxiety and severe depression,1
because others will not listen to my conversations about my agony due to my nervous systems lines of communication being tangled in unbearably painful knots  (victoria orango),0
it is so late for me now so not saying to much!this is what i keep saying the "so called normal people do the most stupid things in life"well a lot of us are very knowledgeable of things things because also of anxiety "where it comes to me"!,0
i had uncontrollable leg and arm movements and allergic reaction to the drug,0
hawthorne works for me hawthorne controls and corrects low blood pressure it also lowers high blood pressure,1
i follow this page and i really hope these "take your meds" post help you all i for one cant stand the pills im given they repress my emotions and make me feel "not me",1
sometimes composure comes to late now the guilt and embarrassment sets in i try to stay controlled but if u hit one of my buttons its at ur risk,0
people dont see when we are struggling so very hard to keep our disorder from spilling out and becoming obvious this is when they think we can "just get over it" or that it isnt a "real" disorder,0
i have had a terrible day today couldnt get out of bed extremely depressed and no desire to do anything very painful anxiety and depression drs dont seem to know how painful this can be,1
this post is awesome i also have a mental illness and for about 2months i have been thinking about suicide now and it scary i talked to my dr and he made a med change,1
if people could live in our heads for a week they would never doubt us again we are stronger and smarter than people give us credit for,0
we all know someone who is suffering form anxiety and depression keep them in your prayers,1
my friends adopted famille and family get thisif cannot the fire or dragon dont poke at the cave where she dwells or feed the fire or ashes ashes,0
i only feel lonely when im not scared,0

you are doing it reaching out to us that most have experienced the same thing i go to the extreme when my husband is moody i think what have i done now when i fact has nothing to do with me when im stressed i think oh god he wants a divorce when actually he was in physical pain from falling and did not want me to worry we all do this he sounds like a great guy take it one day at a time,0

it just now makes me more guilty to ask for help ,1
taking care of yourself needs to be a priority! were all guilty of ignoring ourselves! but we cannot help others if we do not help ourselves! ❤ ~dani,1
its so hard not to feel guilty on trying to help other people it feels like madness ,0
take your meds you need them you have way too many things going on in your life to be able to manage them without meds as for your boy friend he is the one who bears the brunt of your behavior when you dont take them i dont blame him my ex husband is borderline personality disorder and with just that life was a real struggle he refused meds were now divorced i couldnt continue when he wouldnt let the doctors help him,1
ok so part of being healthy is taking your meds like it or not we are incurable i makes me so sad when i see someone feel better and decide they are all fixed and quit taking their meds imagine if we struggle to live with ourselves how do we expect someone else to? take your meds,1
i would try to remember that despite their best intentions loved ones who dont have these same illnesses sometimes dont know what to do to help us because we love them their opinions mean the most and can hurt us the most in times like this i would suggest possibly checking into couples counselling to educate him as well i hear everyone whos saying stay on your meds but i can say from experience sometimes they make things worse especially if we are given to many or ones that are not working for us ive seen amazing results with natural treatment but that doesnt work for everyone the worst is doctors prescribing many meds who are not specialists in this area a good psychiatrist could help you get them balanced out if you feel your on to many and are not already seeing one this is a life long struggle for so many of us please dont give up keep trying different things until you find what works for you mediation and mindfulness and dbt can also be very helpful wishing you the best ❤️,0
please take your meds the side affects are way more detrimental then if you are on your meds stopping cold turkey can cause seizures and a whole array of permanent damage im not trying to scare you but i know how it feels to be zombified and sluggish and tired but you really need to speak with your physch dr and therapist sweety and your bf is also speaking the truth im not being mean im just speaking reality and a long time ago i was constantly on and off my meds it was horrendous and i was a horrible nightmare and train wreck doing that i was constantly in and out of the hospital i was out of control and basically abusive to everyone in my life so please please take your meds otherwise youll be on a darker side youve never been on and medication adjustment takes a while but once your stable trust me you will be thankful and speaking from your bfs side he just doesnt want to see your in pain and hurting yourself and do not give up and give in its not the answer sweety i know its hard and trying but you can do it your journey isnt over and once your in a great place youll look back and realize you have conquered that dark place anyways i hope this helps sweety,1
take them period i have diabetes depression & anxiety i take them religiously like my insulin these meds are our ticket for the journey to wellbeing,1
the first thing you need to do is to call your doctor  he can tell you how to get started taking them again you might have go to the hospital dont be afraid  my daughter has battled all things you mentioned she has been fighting them the l,1
it can take a while to find the right meds balance that suits you it took me a couple of years i would highly recommend though you dont stop taking your medication you have a serious mental health condition that can cause you to attempt suicide please go back to your consultant and speak to them as for your boyfriend he may be scared of the consequences of you stopping your meds good luck xx,1
early last year i allowed somebody (formerly) close to me shame me for my reliance on meds for my mental illnessi am bipolar and have complex ptsd from both child abuse and combati stopped for 4 monthsim still struggling to completely come back from the damage i did to my lifeit was a train wreckso nowin addition to my core issuesi have major regret for the choices i made and the way i acted in those dark unmedicated monthstake your meds and be grateful your man loves you enough to even give you an opportunity to fix thisitooam blessed to have a husband who knows i am not my behavior and hes been longsufferingbelieve mebe a responsible grown-up and take your medicineits by far the lesser of 2 evils,0
im 29 bipolar depressed anxiety possibly ptsd and have panic attacks havent taken meds since i was 18 have been forever debating going to get put in meds but didnt like the way i was on lamictal 15mg made me a zombie to the point my parents told me to stop 11yrs later and 3kids later i believe i should go on them at the very least start taking vitamin b,1
you really need to keep fighting and take your medseach and every day!im not trying to sound mean at all so please dont take this the wrong wayhunbut you cant blame people in your life wanting to leave if youre not on them!they honestly should not have to deal with that dramaive had 2 bfs leave meseveral friendsand family even refuse to talk to me if im not on my medsbut i take responsibility for my actionsand i realize what a horrible person i am when im not on themi am up/down every 10 minuteshappy then dangerously angrywhere im breaking stuff and cannot control my emotionsso its no wonder why everybody left me! nowdaysi just take them everydaylike im supposed toand i refuse to stop fighting!i refuse to lose anyone else because of my actions when im not on themi am a responsible personand i want my life to get better just keep in mindwhen you dont take your medstheres much more to worry about then yourselfyou risk losing your loved onesdont make the same mistakes i didplease keep fighting,0
hello i have been where you are i am 38 and wasnt diagnosed until i was 33 with bi-polar 1 anxiety and borderline i can tell you it caused a lot of issue for me relationship wise and i wish i would of had someone back then to help me before i was placed on my meds i was pretty unstable  anger  moods all over the place and very impulsive it even lead me into some legal issues the downward spiral you are having right now is due to not being able to process the emotions at the moment correctly and that is because you are inconsistent with your meds your bf threat to leave is a understandable reason for this spiral but speaking from having been thru a similar thing before its because he wants to see you mentally healthy if you two have been together over 5 years i am sure he has seen you at your best and your worse my suggestion to you is to look into if you have a stabilization center near you i have had to do it a couple times in the past you can check yourself in as a walk in  average stay is 3-5 days if you truly want to help yourself then becoming stable should be your priority and once you do this you will see the talk from him of leaving was just his way of trying to get you to realize you need the help,1
i have all those same probs n i havemt taken a pill in 3+yrs my husband knows i have good n bad days but he still supports me in whatever i have to deal with if u dont like pills go natural there are tons of herbs n tinctures u can use i managed to find a few things that help without the meds its trial n error start small and try diff things till u find something that eases most of ur symptoms its ur personal choiceur life if u dont wanna take meds then dont but dont let ur bf pressure u into takin them jst cus half the meds they give u for this crap are ssris i recommend doing some research as for the rest of u ppl that keep telling her to take her meds fck u its her fckin choice uf she wants to take them or not u dont need pharmaceuticals to combat mental illnesses there are many other options she can use,1
let him go its not worth more stress in your life i no its hard but with time we move on,0
try to eliminate some of the meds that are not doing anything for you and keep taking the meds that do it can take quite a while to find which ones are right for you and what the minimum dose is that is effective being pressured will not leave you in a position to reduce any of your meds being misunderstood will make you feel worse i have had to accept that i have to take my tablets i have tried to stop taking them before and landed up being much worse than what i began work with your doctor or mental health clinic to establish which one or two tablets may be balancing the chemicals in your brain sometimes the onset is triggered by certain persons in your life but even if you stay away from them you may need less meds but the imbalance will still be there albeit to a lesser degree people who do not understand sometimes are denying their own shortcomings concerning their mental health good luck,1
please take your meds you need them its nothing to be ashamed about ive come to accept that ill need to be on meds for the rest of my life i have bipolar ii and depression i couldnt function without my meds,1
there is an imbalace you need your meds if you are having adverse side effects tell your doc if youre taking them irregularly youre still not getting that balance you need! mental illness is not easy and its so hard to force yourself to take your meds and no they are not a cure all its not like theyre magically gonna make everything better but theybwill help you jave a more focused valuable life! understand non mentally ill ppl do not know our struggle we are giving them a war! listen to their needs as well as yours but always take care of yourself!,0
personally i think it is irresponsible to not take meds if your doctor gave them to you what happened to grown up self disciple? i take mine if not for me then for the people who have to deal with me it isnt fair to them for me to refuse my meds and then expect them to understand when i have bad day or i am acting up or in depressive slump i love the people in my life and would rather spare them the hardship of living with me unnecessarily because i choose not to swallow a few pills i have ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar 1,1
its funny how the mentally ill are on the front lines so to speak to battle the stigma of mental illness isnt it? your comment resonated with me in that sense its definitely a hard struggle to say the least but we must keep on fighting every day,0
as a bipolar with anxiety and ptsd take your meds! talk to your doc if you want to cut some out or see if theres something out there that can take their place,1
i am in the belief he has took to strong words because he is worried and doesnt know how to express feeling of losing you too the demons that medication keeping away hopes and prayers with you,1
i hate meds myself and would prefer more natural methods however ive come to realize that not every illness can be managed this way and i need to take pharmaceuticals some meds are necessary in order for us to have even a small quality of life in our day even if we dont want to take them or dont think they help if you dont think they are helping though id definitely consult with your doctor and pharmacist as well about possibly changing them up remember though any changes of meds comes with an adjustment phase that can sometimes be rough i know you are worried about your partner but you need to be a bit selfish and focus on you its very hard to know how much you are dealing with when you are stressed or focused on the concerns of others,0
everyone hates me as well as i really really hate myself dealing with bpd depression ptsd anxiety really bad flash backs makes it worse it much more then hate,1
talked to an old friend of mine this evening between a job where i feel trapped/in prisonnot being able to go anywhere but work and having no transportationhe was very worried about me gonna loan me some money to get me a small scooter to be able to have transportationfind a better job and get out of the house thats the first time id talked to anyone (other than my roommate and those at work) in a couple of months,0
depression + anxiety = i dont care and everyone hates me sigh my life,1
i have panic disorder and i learned not to care about what anyone thinks,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page yeah smartphone is a contradiction case in point: ive got an ongoing battle with mine over its need to change the word "when" to "she" for absolutely no good reason i think a lot of the text style with the lack of proper words and the need to use letters and numbers has more to do with age than anything else while i do know some people in my age group that do the letters and numbers the vast majority of them text the way they were taught to write in school,1
i usually try use proper spelling and grammar im far from perfect but even when texting i use sentences and never use "u" "2"  etc some friends poke fun at me for it but i just find it easier to understand! sometimes i get so confused with all the lingo! ~dani,0
hahahah id make sure i just reply "youre*" to avoid confusion ,0
no one can feel and know exactly how you feel all the listening and empathy cannot allow any one else know how frustrating painful and lost you are  when trying to support loved ones we may say things that seem uncaring or judgmental but is never ever meant to hurt or distress you were all doing our best with love  ❤️❤️❤️,0
i remember been like that with my ex husband but not with this bf that i have i dont know why but he is nice and a good person my ex husband was more handsome that my actual bf i dont know if i trust hem more cause i am more mature or because i am now in meds and i wasnt before i remember having my first mental breakdown when my cousing told me my husband was"cheating"on me since then i been havimg problems and it doent matter if i am ok i still have my time when i get sick and endup and a mental facilityi dont know exacly what works cause i been in the darkes situations and now i feel ok but i noticed i stoped 2 meds and i get upset easier than before i dont care if my bf stays late drinking with our neighbor i trust hem and i go to sleep happy without worries,1

for someone with your history that seems completely normal i have been cheated on i am also now with an amazing man yet i always feel insecure & talk about "if" we break up which upsets him i just feel like i need to get myself ready for it as the first time i was totally unprepared it ruined me i went through years of not knowing what was wrong with me i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with ocd traits social anxiety disorder gad & seasonal affective disorder i take my meds & try to just concentrate on each day for me looking too far ahead overwhelmes me i was told by a doctor once that i need to think of my illness like i have diabetes i cant be cured but i need to maintain my condition i wish you all the best & respect you for putting yourself out there sending lots of love your way ,0
if this is how you are feeling right this minute then i suggest you go seek profesional help now not tomorrow i suffer with mixed bpd plus anxiety so i am in no position to advise otherwise good luck in getting the help you need,1
seduce them with awkward!,0
a few weird/awkward conversations that you hope will work,1
that makes so much sense ryan!! i rarely cry when sad or depressed i cry when angry anxious or stressed,0
people say that suicide is cowardly it is not as it is a desperate act triggered by agony beyond words images and sounds the persons nervous systems lines of communication are tangled in unbearably painful knotts (victoria arango),0
damm straight just because you want to be head and chop up into little peices everyone who has belittled terrorized and hurt you in the past :(apparently thats not normal :(,0
yes sometimes i scare myself,0
thanks curtis  that was very supportive and encouraging im glad im not as alone as i thought i was  ive had many failed attempts as well i dont know how ive survived this long eitheri think about suicide a lot to and i think about how i will end my life i would say i would probelly fantasize it as well at times when i think about it i get jealous of ppl who succeed in committing suicide becuz that could be mei to cant wait for the day i can rest in peace and i doubt it will be in this lifetime thats why i feel like suicide is my only option at times  sad but trueyes i totally agree i cant wait till i dont have to hurt the way i hurt or feel the terrible deep intense dark feelings that i feel its a nightmare i also get jealous of those who dont suffer with mental health issues cuz i agree i definitely think its totally unfairits hard to accept it though i just started working with a new therapist once a week for a hour  shes been very nice and is helping me not hold in my feelings and emotions as much and working on my negative thinking and self hate issues i hope it continues to be a helpful and productive therapy for me cuz its going well so far but ive only been seeing her for maybe three weeks or so but shes been great and very supportive and she understands my struggles with depression and anxiety im trying to change my thinking when i get suicidal which is very often  my therapist wants to make a pact with her i guess before i hurt myself or attempt suicide i have to reach out but thanks again for the nice message it really made my night and im feeling better for now  its great to know maybe a few ppl still understand and care about what im going thru  i appreciate it,0
i think its safer keeping those thoughts to ourselves to prevent getting locked up you can take that either way legal or mental id rather open up anonymously i dont want people knowing everything that goes on inside my head hell sometimes it scares me,0
if you dont belong on this site and have no respect for others that are hurting or going through things or do not understand dark thoughts which mean many different things for many different people and yes theres some things that we just should never say out loud every single person on this planet has had many types of dark thoughts trust me but as someone with a mental illness it can be much harder to bare including just thoughts about yourself your life people in your life etc but again if you dont understand these things you probably dont belong on this site and the truth be told you may not even have a mental illness so why the heck are you on here have a little common sense and decency and find someone else to bother only people that are struggling alone and if you do struggle in your life with anything i hope people are there for you you should not judge and i am not trying to judge you but you are certainly trying to judge in what does thoughts means from a group that is all about trying to figure out their mindset and trying to heal without compassion or respect this is not the site for you!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
yes i have lots of negative thoughts and suicidal thoughts but it seems lots of ppl on here are not understanding or supportive so its a little upsetting especially since im really needing help and support yes suicide is a very real thing thing for me,0
what!? youre crazy! (not in literal terms) ive spoke with a lot of nice people who share my struggles and if they dont theyre generous to talk to you and if you feel like no ones listening to you im here ☺️,0
suicide is very real for me as well i am a suicidal person ive had many failed attempts some i dont know how i survived i idealize it on a daily basis ill run through my head how im going to do it so that next time it works i fantasize about death and dying when i hear of someone making a attempt and succeeding i get envious and jealous i just long for the day when ill actually be able to rest in peace and not hurt the way i hurt or feel the feelings that i do i also get envious and jealous of people who dont have the struggles of being suicidal because sometimes i think its not fair but i try and accept it for what it is and i work super close with my therapist once a week to try and change my thinking when i start to go down the suicide road but for the time being i made a pact that i have to be here for my girls (dogs) because nobody will take care of them the way i do keep your head up beautiful and know that you are not alone and we are warriors who battle wars most people couldnt fathom fighting and we make it one day at a time its not a good feeling to be suicidal but it is real and there is support out there were not alone keep your chin up (((((hug))))),0
this whole conversation is disturbing,0
i think a lot of us or jus myself dont talk about exactly what i think because im scared of judgement my thoughts scare and disgust me my thoughts make me feel evil like im not human anymore ,0
i talked to my gp about my dark thoughts and she could not handle them freaked put and demanded to have me admitted a psychiatrist had to educate her on what thoughts are and how to determine the real risk embarrassing for her i dont see her any more,0
every damned day! the thing is even though i have mental ill health i am generally a happy person and i try to show it on the outside so only a few people know what goes on inside my head if people know the true extent of what goes on they would be genuinely worried (and possibly quite scared) so i dont let people know most of the stuff i think many others are in the same boat as well which is quite sad,0
i was while on risperidone quite disturbing thoughts theyve pretty much gone away since switching to seroquel,0
sadly i do it gets quite scary sometimes,0
every single day it scares the shit out of me that i could even muster up such dark thoughts,0
jules letellier yes being mindful of my thoughts i have a bad habit of living in yesterday which doesnt help my depression living in tomorrow which doesnt help my anxiety my mind roaming to the dark places and i get very consumed thinking about things that are happening in the world and i feel all those emotions that others are probably feeling as this devastation is taking place i feel empathy and sympathy for all the humans and animals that are out there right now suffering and being abused and i can get stuck there and it feels awful not so much accepting the thoughts but redirecting them to something healthier that doesnt make me feel so horrible like saying to myself if these thoughts arent going to help or change things then i need to redirect my thoughts to more positive ones its a very hard process but i do have a wonderful therapist and i dont know where id be without her small steps ,0
yes i agree its scary that we could have such intense and morbidly dark thoughts in our minds but i deal with these thoughts daily  its a struggle,0
this is disturbing and should be taken down,1
disturbing?? how about this opens a dialogue for those who want and need to talkplease educate your self or you will be offended by someone with diabetes next ignorance before investigation always gets me in troublehave a blessed day,0
wanna explain why this is disturbing ??,0
how is this disturbing explain ,0
rightwe should all keep hiding in the dark and feel ashamed of our own thoughtsgo away,0
yes this is so me ive been struggling since i was thirteen years old im now 29,0
im in the houston tx area where we have hurricane harvey i talked to my drs office yesterday before they closed at noon because one of meds i dont have enough to get me through this mess because its a free clinic thats where i also get my meds from their pharmacy but the pharmacy is already closed so there is no access until this hurricane is over and that could be for days im in this apt with a disabled vet who also has ptsd weve had some interesting times of his ptsd mixed with my bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd mostly we are able to laugh and joke  but if you could please keep us in your prayers im a little nutty right now!,1
every day is a struggle for me and its hard but i would let it win this time this biche is not going down with out a fight it can grow legs and pissed off,0
i struggle all the time ,0
you will never trust him again! every time his phone bleeps or hes slightly late you will feel worst ! and already suffering with anxiety do you feel you can handle it ? z,0
the two of you were separated so technically he didnt cheat thats the one thing he has in his favor but he must not have very much respect for you let alone love if he could go out and sleep with someone else knowing the effect it would have on you my husband actually did cheat on me then he came home and threw it in my face because he knew it would be the one thing that would hurt me the most and to make matters even worse he had the affair on new years which means not only will i always remember the exact day it happened but ill start each new year angry hurt and resentful yeah fun for me i can tell you from experience that it does get easier to live with eventually youll reach a point where its not the very first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning youll always have that brick in your chest where your heart used to be but since its always there youll get used to it and wont notice it so much anymore but there will always be those impossible-to-answer questions thatll cause you to lose sleep at night "does he really love me?" "how could he do this to me?" "why her?" "does he have feelings for her?" "will he do it again?" "am i an idiot for taking him back?" "does the fact that i did make me weak?" "is she better than me?" those questions will drive you insane at night i understand how you feel like you i love my husband more than anything too and its hard to get past a betrayal of that magnitude fortunately my husband didnt get his squeeze toy pregnant so i dont have to worry about her being in my face for the rest of my life and i cant even begin to imagine how that must feel i honestly dont think i couldve handled it so he probably wouldve been gone under those circumstances it just depends on you and how you feel ask yourself which is stronger your love for him or the resentment you feel toward him? you may not have reached the resentful stage yet but trust me you will and keep in mind that men are very physical creatures (shocker) whereas as women are very emotional for them sex isnt always just about pleasure its something they often resort to in times of stress anger sadness and loneliness because their brains arent wired to express emotion like womens are for men sex is often used as an outlet so it could be that he was missing you and just used her to make himself feel better (a lot of women out there are reading that last part going "umm no" lol) which was a really shitty thing to do in my opinion but everyone handles things differently i suppose keep in mind that i am in no way justifying what either of our husbands did men might not be as emotionally complicated as women but they know right from wrong and have the ability to control their actions just like anyone else but if you love your husband half as much as i love mine you wont leave him no matter how many people advise you to so im just trying to help you look at it a different way to give you some peace of mind and hopefully make it a little easier on you youll probably always love him regardless but your feelings for him will never be the same after this so you just have to ask yourself if youre prepared to live with that but youre not "weak" or "stupid" if you choose to stay not that anyone implied that but thats how i spent a lot of time feeling when my husband did what he did id say to myself "how could i possibly take him back after that? i must be crazy normal people dont stay with someone who cheated on them they leave! i must be the weakest stupidest person on the planet" but after a while i realized it was the complete opposite it takes a strong person to stay and get past something like that cuz it hurts worse than just about anything id rather have both my legs cut out from underneath me than ever feel like that again i hope something i said made you feel a little better cuz i know what that kind of heartache feels like and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy it will get easier i promise but your feelings will never be the same,0
she told him she was on birth control and was messaging me telling me he already filed for divorce she was taunting me and making it a point to let me know that they was going to spend the rest of their lives together she even sent me a picture of rings they were looking at i myself suffer from depression anxiety ptsd so all this is really taking a toll on me thank you guys for being supportive and understanding as well,0
you talk far more sense than some others on here they all talk about betrayal and him having an affair!!! not one person has even considered what he was going through at the time its not only the person suffering from depression and anxiety that is suffering but also the partner hence the separation at the end of the day he was going through a bad time too did a stupid thing n it unfortunately resulted in a pregnancy if you cant get past that n support each other through this then it wont work the other lady didnt ask for all this so just try hard to make it work together n not to fight,0
i am bipolar i have been on wellbutrin for years when i first started on it it did not come in extended release i would have break thru anxiety attacks the extended release version does not seem to cause this problem and has put my depression on hold,1
i have bipolar disorder the first several months were really good but it gradually made me more and more anxious to a point i could barely function i think its good for a lot of people but its also known to throw you into a mania and increase anxiety,1
i am on it i still have panic attacks bad about driving and crowds i now cant sleep since my dose was increased but im no longer depressed,0
im on 75 mg twice a day and 20 mg of cexela and im still struggling no side affects though,0
wellbutrin was the first antidepressant to work for me so i love it just be careful of some of the side effects it can cause sleep disruption anxiety weightloss then weight gain,1
i have worked up to 300 mg daily for about a year now it helps stabilize my depression and anxiety it keeps me off of cigarettes i love it; but results may vary blah blah blah,1
i have depression/anxiety/ptsd and have been on it for a couple years and its worked pretty good =),1
its helped me with the depression of my bipolar but gave me terrible headaches and did nothing for my anxiety,1
if youre bipolar you may want to discuss whether or not wellbutrin is right for your condition as it can cause mania since this page is also devoted to people with depression and anxiety as well i can speak from experience as i dont have bipolar but i do have depression & anxiety wellbutrin puts my depression on hold entirely my pervasive thought loops shut down so i can think more clearly my attention is better and so is my ability to concentrate ive also lost about 20 pounds (but i needed to lose weight) bad parts? 1 it makes me jittery and a little twitchy i find myself to be more physically restless so i move around a lot more than i used to 2 it wears off for me late in the evening (as i take it when i first get up in the morning) and my depression can start to rear its head again in the late evening i usually try to offset that by going to bed some people also say that wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety i cant really tell since my anxiety is so bad anyway that i doubt id notice if it were made a tiny bit worse it would have to make me much worse in order for me to notice but it can (for some people) cause increased anxiety if you have any side effects that are bothersome or that make you feel worse im sure you already know to return to your doctor and get the medication switched i love wellbutrin as its working well for me i wish you only the best of luck with your new medication,1
it was terrible for me caused me to be very irritable at the time i was on it a few years ago i had been misdiagnosed with bipolar i quickly took myself off of it years later this year turns out i actually have bpd/ major depression/ anxiety im on paxil and xanax now and its helped wonders just keep in mind different medicines react differently with each individual,1
it will help you quit smoking but its terrible for anxiety or bpd,1
absolutely separation from a partner can become a common trigger for anxiety or panic attacks your mind may ruminate over bad thoughts they may be your main support you may worry about them med adjustments and cbt can help just stick with it,1
i have bipolar disorder ptsd and add i had horrible depression and they tried everything under the sun but just kept going down the list zoloft worked then quit so did cymbalta so down the list we continued now i am on paxil abilify which is a godsend! lithium lamictal ativan for anxiety with baclofen adderral for energy and i am finally pretty stable,1
in general it is not used even in bipolar they try not to use it if they can avoid it because of the way it can beat the kidneys up she didnt say lithium someone in the responses did not sure if it was you or not im happy it works for you its a battle a lot of the time finding what works for each of us i was speaking in overall general terms,1
you can see it with me i start to shake a little and nervous also start sweating,1
serroquil is bad i rather do tylenol pm i take hydroxyzine and it doesnt help me when i have panic attacks however i take it earlier in the morning when i knw work is going to be tuff alprazolam is the only thing that controls my panic attacks,1
i took seroquel at bedtime slept but felt like cap during the day exhausted and irritable to no end took years but finally found a combo that works well for me keep looking and stay on top of your doctor you deserve to feel good night and day,1
you can have them in 25mg for daytimethats what i usebut cannabis is way better for anxietyreally kills it for melife changerbit heavy to be on seroquell 24/7,1
the hydrogen is a blood pressure med i dont agree putting people on them they put me on 2 different ones one night my blood pressure was so low i just drop to the floor had to call ambulance go to emergency room i jack my knees up so bad they hurt for 4 months you will get more relief from the seroqul than the other i take small doses all threw the day it helps take anything they offer but high blood pressure meds they are messing with something they have no business doing,1
after 25 plus years of trying this or that cymbalta works for me and the best thing about it is that it takes about 3 days to start working i am so thankful to have found this medicine its unbelievable for me i am now using cbd oil hempworx it is working wonders on my aches pains and anxiety but my depression not so much yeti have faith <3 if anyone wants info on cbd oil shoot me a message thanks~vonda,1
maybe a trial of buspar- it is specifically for anxiety but will take a couple of weeks to take effect has helped me a great deal,1
buspar is a very light anxiety med it sounds like you need something different talk to your dr,1
sometimes it takes lots of med changes to find the right combination stick with it eventually youll find a combo that works but it does sound like you may need ativan klonopin valium or xanax for the anxiety itselfbest of luck to youhang in there!!,1
finding the right meds and dosages is a trial and error that everyone had to go through it can be hard and this is the phase where people sometimes give up and swear off meds all together dont give up! you will find the right ones that work for you please keep trying youre on the right track your doctor may need to perscribe a seperate anxiety medication definantly keep in contact with your doctor over the issue and keep trying things out the only real thing i can recomend from expirence is it often takes at least 1-2 weeks on any medication to see a diffrence unless the side effects are dibilitating please try and give it 2 weeks before deciding things arent working and moving on,1
ah ok we didnt have access to music (cords can be used for asphyxiation) i missed having a support system after i got out i had to fend for myself again - in the hospital i just showed up to meals i missed having people that "got it" - we would be genuine in our laughter about our "inappropriate" jokes about where we were having very frank discussions about what brought us there etc i didnt have to hide anything - everything was on the table out in the open suicide attempts mania hearing voices sex addiction drug abuse things that were taboo in normal society were normal for us and i still miss that i miss being able to be myself even if it was depressed and scared and ashamed i never put on good graces there i miss being safe it took me about 3 weeks before i felt comfortable being on the outside talking to people and i still wasnt completely assimilated i definitely had to put on the happy face and say that i was doing ok (even though i definitely wasnt - one week in a hospital doesnt cure you it just gives you a safe place to start to heal) i dreaded going out to the mall (i just didnt) going grocery shopping (had to do it) running into friends ("havent heard from you in a while!" thats because i was in a psych ward)i physically felt like i needed to duck to avoidsomething i was off work for 6 weeks (and it would have been longer but i teach and it was the end of the year) and all anyone knew was that i was sick my staff was terrific and only 2 people knew where i was - it was the best kept secret ever in that building 2 people out of 120 i will never be able to re-pay that debt but getting back into the regular world was hard it takes time but it doesnt happen for me 3 days was just scratching the surface of my return into society,0
i understand it makes you feel crappy but you shouldnt stop taking it a lot of medication can have negative side effects but after taking them for a couple weeks and they get in your system and your body adjusted the side effects will go away but now since youve stopped them you wont know if they are going to help you or not one of the meds im on actually i had horrible side effects when i started them! i was having nightmares i was throwing up just thinking about food and i even pissed the bed 3 nights in a row!! i told my doctor about it right away and said i cant handle this! he told me to please take them for 2 weeks after 1 week and 2 days those side effects started slowing down and after 3 weeks i havent had any side effects at all! they all went away completely! ive been on this med for 4 months now and its by far the best medication that ive ever been on in the past 20 years!!! just my advice a little food for thought ~dani,0
nope i will not be ashamed of my emotions,0
i understand how u feel i have my highs & lows while on 300mg zoloft pluse 9 mg valium and neulactil 4 a day  any emotional event can cause having lows i have trouble getting out bed as i feel when ur sleeping u feel no emotions i used to smoke a bit of canabis to help me stay calm but had heart attack cartiac arrest & stoped canabis so i find i struggle more without it im in process getting my meds changed due to weight gain im dreading it cos i dont cope at all  i hope u start feeling better soon just talk to ur dr about ur medication it might need to be increased  x,0
having a mental illness means sometimes dosages need to be adjusted or medications need to be changed my exwife struggled for years until she found the right medication and dosage first it was lithium then topamax finally depakote worked the best medications for depression and anxiety are somewhat the same you have to get the medication that works best and the correct dosage for my anxiety clonzapam was the right medication from the start but depression medication is an on going challenge first it was pristiq then lexapro cymbalta amatriptyline and countless others to date i am still searching for the right medication sometimes these take time but dont give up hope you will get it right and you will know it my exwife knew she was on the right medication without anyone telling her so,1
one thing that people forgot to mention is god its not about being religious but about being spiritual and that means believing in something positive and good there​ had to had been something that triggered those feelings of depression back and its hard to distinguish what it was i personally feel get those horrible feelings all of a sudden that i immediately react in a way that is unforgivable to my loved ones i beg god to make me a different and better normal human being because i dont even like myself(my outbursts) and its been months since ive taken my meds and i thought that i would of already been in the mental ward by now but thank god that he has allowed me to still be here with my family doing the best that i can to manage it so what ive also done was i begged my husband to educate himself on bipolar and all the rest of the disorder does to a person so that he could learn how to cope and so he could help me manage it because all the medicine ive been taking all these years were only numbing me and im pretty sure not helping my liver nor kidneys basically what im saying is that in order for me to cope with it i need faith in god (ny higher power)the support of my family (them learn about the disorder) so it could show them how to help me manage it and of course for them to also cope in a positive way because if not they would had already left me and i would not know what to do with myself ive been learning something new every day and it doesnt matter how old or young its always good to educate ourselves on any kind of disorder disease or addiction for the sake of the ones we love positive support from family & friends asking for help learning technics on how to control the situations  thoughts that trigger our bipolar mood swings ect and keeping ourselves active to improve our health helps control /manage or not think about those horrible negative feelings from getting worse and so forth but eventually i believe if we follow some of the good positive advise given will do us bipolar people some time and u will see some improvement and it does take time  and the surroundings have a lot to do with it,0
i had horrible reactions with all the other meds lithium is my lifeline i make sure to drink plenty of fluids and docs keep a close eye on toxicity and kidney and liver function basically trying to say different meds work differently for different people,1
lithium is an old medication and i am surprised by how many people are on it lithium is very hard on the kidneys sorry for your loss and the horrible way it went its a shocker epilim is also a mood stabiliser like lithium and causes zero damage to the kidneys and no side effects to me i strongly suggest that you give epilim a go bipolar people tend to need medication to help them manage it when i tried a vitimin therapy that did not work i bounced from one disaster to the next !,1
hey sweetie we have all been where you are dont just suffer i have had bi-polar my entire life the med change is an uncomfortable roller coaster but its worth it youll feel better so go to your dr and feel better soon hugs & prayers,0
nope youre not the only one i have had to do this quite often over the last 35 of having this illness and those that say meds dont cure are right learning your triggers and developing coping skills is all you can do meds dont stop bipolar/depression and anxiety altogether they help control it to being able to survive/live with it i also remember this shall too pass me personally i spend a lot of time in prayer trying to refocus myself also you might have to try new meds every couple to few years i have too the ones i may be on just stop working it sucks but ive always found a new med path i hate adjusting to or trying to find new meds just know youre not alone and treat yourself kindly,1
manic panic schizophrenic ,0
ive struggled with my weight for years and im not even five foot  its so depressing im fed up with being overweight  its hard  been difficult on my self esteem and self image,0
jess n kailey  i agree with you jess how can others understand a depression that is caused by a chemical imbalance if they havent experienced it themselves? they dont which only adds to the stigma and it doesnt help either - in addition to being depressed you should also feel guilty about it? putting oneself out there one will get all kind of responses - try to rule out the ones that only brings you down and look for those who show actual understanding,1
having a good well respected gp is key to getting on disability theres always a medication that can help so dont give up trying even though it can take a while to find the right combo marijuana is good for everything but i cant get it for ptsd an alpha blocker like prazosin helps with nightmares not many gps know this a betta blocker like propranolol is good if you have panic attacks shakes or heart pulpitations other than that anti depressants and a mild antipsychotic does help with anxiety and sleep,1
are you open and able to try marijuana? if not an antidepressant and mood stabilizer with something for anxiety should help! i use them all! and combined it changed my life! and the marijuana alone almost instantly helps bring me out of whatever i am feeling and going through! you would be surprised my opinion though,1
i was scared of taking meds too but then as a last resort i did and they saved my life just know you are not alone in your feelings,0
go on to google and try echo tapping or binaural meditation really helped my anxietyif i have no meds i cannot function and that scares metry and stay focuses when your zoning out concentrate on one thing in the room till it passes and do your breathing exercises i found a new one that i likebreathe in for 4 hold your breath for 7 and then breath out for 8 as many cycles as you canconcentrate on countinghope you feel calmer soon chic x x,1
i would advise you to seek professional help dont be afraid of meds they can help you live a more "normal" life ive accepted that ill be on meds the rest of my life to manage my bipolar ii and the depression good luck to you ,1
sorry but l disagree l was hit with crippling anxiety very similar to you l am a strong person i took anti depressants in combination with therapy on the nhs and two years later l am far better medication is sometimes the answer,1
when things get bad i write every thought downno matter how cluttered or irrational getting it all out really helps sometimes ill write more than 20 pages in my journal one sentence after another not thinking about what im writing but writing what im thinking i ended up finally having the confidence of reading some to my shrink so she would understand how my head was working during issues after about 6 months i started being able to cope a lit better because i wasnt holding anything in anymore which made it possible to process and move forward,0
please see your gp as this will not go away without the help of meds and some techniques with your anxiety dont suffer in silence as the help is out there good luck!!,1
kava kava helped me with anxiety before i had meds you can get it at a local health food store like sprouts its where i got mine,1
if u able to go to the gym every morning it will work wonders especially if u can get into the sauna and just sweat out all the anxiety,1
im going through the process of trying to get disability because i suffer from bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder ptsd major depression add panic anxiety disorder i havent had my hearing yet so i dont know what the outcome is going to be but my chances look good i find that taking baths is very soothing and helps calm the mind i also use symphony music or some type of relaxation music when i feel an anxiety attack coming on breathing techniques sometimes work in through your nose and out through your mouth very slowly sometimes just taking a walk and changing your atmosphere will change the thoughts in your head to help you get over the anxiety i also have a fear of leaving the house so that its hard for me to do even if its only to go to the corner and back try to get out of the house as much as you can i also suffer from flashbacks and nightmares melatonin is a natural sleep medication that might help you at night time i hope you can get your insurance soon and get to a psychiatrist to prescribed some pharmaceuticals to help you with your symptoms good luck to you if you ever need to talk i will be here to listen talk therapy is also helpful to me,1
google "deep breathing for anxiety" find a method you like and practice it at least twice each day it will help you to control the anxiety that is closely associated with the depression i hope this helps,1
i know somwhat how you feel im the same way too the way i try to cope it is write in my journal draw & color & listening to music my depression is in my head my anxiety is out in public,0
faher van zuiden it is irrisponsponsible of you to say what you just did mainly telling this young lady things are never permanent is beyond misleading and cruel the way you are going about it psychological illnesses just dont disappear over time between coping skills and meds a normal happy life is possible and saying we all have them (anxieties and depressions) yes this is true but some of us arent the norm and catorgorizing us as such only says more that you have no idea what youre talking about when it comes down to psychological disorders now to the person asking for help one you can do some research and maybe find a support group for anxiety/depression near you and talking about it does help i have 37 years experience with this one also make sure you get on that phone and get an appointment somewhere as soon as your insurance starts you might be able to get on that phone now and make the appointment knowing you have an appointment coming up helps too are you using lavender and eucalyptus oils burning them in either a diffuser or just a simple oil burner while calmly breathing while relaxing for awhile a couple times hell as much as you can a day it helps toogood luck,1
medication will reduce anxiety & depression whilst seeking professional support learning ways to manage anxiety/depression symptoms i have qualifications in aod & mental health so its not a half arsed comment,1
i have driving anxiety (cuhz my siblings were killed by automobile incidents) and not knowing what other drivers are going to do or how they drive really gets my nervous however i smoke weed for my anxiety i dont smoke enough to get high just enough to calm my nerves and i never smoke indica before driving i stopped taking pharmaceuticals years ago because they only helped if i was taking super high and unsafe doses,1
i also suffer from panic attacks and anxiety attacks i highly recommend you try cbd oil it did wonders for me and its all natural,1
i have anxiety depression and ptsd i can no longer drive and can barely be a passenger its awful,1
i get panic attacks while driving some times if its a place i drive to a lot i know places i can pull over to calm myself down try some type of distractions music,0
i was on all those pills plus some i have bi polar anxiety depression and insomnia my bf hated me so i quit them all at once now i eat vegan and excersise i do love my alcohol and essential oils the pills arent good in my opinion,1
i took klonopin and abilify for years and had no business driving on them i gained 90 lbs and look back on that as a very over-medicated dark unnecessary period in my life i rarely put down anyones medical treatment as i am not their doctor but i am telling you my experience and this fact: it has been discovered that adderall and meth are chemically essentially the same thing id be very scared to meet someone on all the meds your on and adderall,1
id be sleeping with all that but seriously not judging i have anxiety driving however i know how my medication affects me so if i felt impaired at all i wouldnt risk other peoples safety,1
i gave up driving a decade or so ago because the panic attacks i was having driving were out of control within a month of selling my truck the panic attacks pretty much stopped i went from hundreds a month to a couple a year it meant a major life change but at least im not afraid im gonna kill somebody while panicking behind the wheel of a car,0
i was agoraphobic for 5 years could go anywhere in a car i would have to pull over and get out of the car due to anxiety attacks i too have gads  bipolar depression and suffer from ptsd i currently on prozac trazadone and bupropion its a long story but i had to get to a point  after suffering for 40 years that i wasnt going to live my life like that anymore no medicine helped me with my anxiety attacks i only became addicted to them even tho they didnt work 13 yrs ago  i drove from long beach here to moreno valley by myself i hadnt driven in over 10 years,1
i was able to drive fine on klonopin it lowered my anxiety enough so that i was able to actually function its all on how you respond to the medication,1
im do not like seroquel my daughter was on it im on latuda works great better than others every person is different and dose is not always easy to find i take 10mg of diazepam for my anxiety im on tons of meds because i also have ra crohnes diverticulitis depression migraine so it just keeps getting worse,1
i take gabapentin mainly for bi polar and helps bone spurs in my back thats a plus i would change your time on kolonopin deffinatly can get you a dui if you have to go somewhere take it when you get back if it has a strong effect i take seroquel threw out the day doesnt effect anything cause my anxiety is so high,1
100mg of seroquel left alone is enough for you to avoid drivingdamn,0
who can i talk to that i can discuss options with to treat my severe anxiety and severe depression? do i need to be referred by a primary care physician to see any specialist?,1
i take citalopram 40 mg no problems with driving i find it helpful if you have something to drink with you just in case a panic attack startsit works for me anyways,1
i have severe anxiety while driving i have taken severe panic attacks in the middle of big highways i have learned when i can and cannot drive because of anxiety i use to take lorazapam for anxiety and would take it about 30 minutes before leaving the home it helped greatly and never felt that i was under the influence or drugged in any way i felt like any other person driving on the road then i got pregnant and i decided to try to not use any meds for as long as the anxiety would let me it has been about 2 years or so now anyways i deff think there are certain meds that can help you that are okay to drive while taking them as long as you are use to them and know how it will affect you,1
i think it depends on your history with driving if you got in a bad accident you may have ptsd due to it (which case therapy would be a good remedy) if you are a new driver it is normal to feel anxious i dont know if people have medications just for driving,0
im 30 and still have a learners permit because im terrified of driving i get so anxious that i get tunnel vision rapid heart beat and i cant keep thoughts straight im on pills for anxiety and depression but it does nothing when it comes to cars im on lamictal abilify hydroxyzine propanalol,0
it seems many different meds are being thrown out there to you for forthought with all their reactions/side-effects all over the place from person to person i do know every drug works different for each of us so i would think taking someone elses reactions to possible meds or even med combo can lead to trouble if you were see them as how you would or wouldnt react to them yourself i wanted to believe this reality many moons ago i have been diagnosed with this disease for 30+ years and have taken many different meds in many different combos remember a med can react one way with you and a whole other way with you depending on the other meds taken with it or just because your you for instance i have taken hydroxyzine with previous meds other than the ones im on now and tolerated it fully it helped but now if i was to well it floors me so tired you asked what others take for anxiety attacks i do take klonipin 1 mg for severe anxiety i take the dissolvable kind where they melt on my tongue and act instantly without this med i would be a basket case of anxiety as for me i dont linger away from docs directions for a second like taking one more or even not taking one at all this is dangerous staying within my guidelines i function normal i couldnt do gabatine and many others they just dont touch mejust know youre not alone but that not one of us is alike with the meds that work for them thus the reason these illnesses are so hard to get a hold of yet even cure good luck,1
the way ive learned to deal with my anxiety on the road is a little unorthodox i use a fidget spinner it occupies just enough of my attention to ignore most of the annoyances,1
i take buspar 2x a day every day and then i have ativan 3 per day as need at 1mg per pill im also on 4 other meds also since i cant go out in public with out having a panic attack,0
i used to have full blown panic attacks any time i had to drive long distances and had to pull over and go into a gas station bathroom for 30 mins or more just to calm down i finally got klonopin i take once a day or twice if needed and i do okay i d still rather not drive and be a passenger and have my tablet to keep me occupied on long trips,0
this sounds like me minus the klonopin when the anxiety is bad and i try to drive like an hour away i will panic and need to turn around and go home for a while,1
i didnt drive for several years due to panic attacks a wise psychiatrist put me in trofonil and it changed my life!,1
i also have driving anxiety to the point where i have to pull over and throw up i dont take anything though im on three antidepressants and thats enough,1
antidepressants wont help with anxiety unfortunately,1
whenever someone tells me they got off meds and change their diet use essential oils and exercise first i wonder are you bipolar because if you are youre manic and get help sick people never know theyre sick until its too late the psychosis anxiety suicidal ideation and general delusions i dealt with when i was truly sick and everyone saw but i thought i was fine were truly life threatening i thought everyone else was nuts thinking something was wrong with me bipolar episodes are no joke chemical imbalances get fixed with chemicals! theres a little science for you,0
messing with bipolar medication is a very serious thing anxiety may be a symptom from the bipolar however no one should recommend anyone to get off medication that is not a doctor for some people its a crisis without their medication because its a legitimate chemical imbalance mental illness is not anything new gmo gluten etc chemicals this and that wasnt around in the bible days so please keep your natural remedies to yourself unless you went to medical school,1
this attitude valerie is one that really upsets me dont you think those of us multiple medications to feel bad enough already,0
valerie wencka i dont disagree with your opinion but how you spoke it im personally weaning off meds with the help of an amazing husband change in diet and therapy i still have sleep meds and anxiety meds both on an as needed basis im also starting college on monday so that may change,1
valerie wencka do you even know what it is to have anxiety? some peoples is worse than others and requires medication not all holistic stuff works i have bad anxiety and take 40mg of celexa and 2mg of klonopin daily the klonopin does not make me sleepy though do not see why you can not drive,1
yes lets all stop taking our meds and instead go to whole foods smh it must be all that gluten that causes anxiety maybe gmos and high fructose corn syrup too!,1
thats the main portion of my anxiety i used to love driving it was one of my favorite things to do and i insisted on being the one to drive any time my family or friends went somewhere with me the last year i was suddenly afflicted with severe driving anxiety to the point that i have anxiety attacks just thinking about driving my doctor put me on klonopin and gabapentin 3/day for anxiety but it doesnt really help my driving anxiety like you i cant take klonopin before driving as it makes me super sleepy :( i know this probably doesnt help you much sadly i dont have any real answers i just wanted you to know that you are not alone *hug*,0
if you know the anxiety comes with driving maybe talk to your therapist they know how to deal with it when you can pinpoint a certain phobia,0
i have severe driving anxiety as well i take only buspirone for anxiety and so far it hasnt touched it at least i know im not the only one out there with driving anxiety,1
i also have anxiety ended up laying in the floor at work for 30 min + last night because of it that was before i went home 2 hours early to take my medicine that i usually don tell need to bring with me i only take my anxiety meds as needed not daily it was a really bad night delusional obsessive thoughts were what caused my anxiety last night :( i take hydroxyzine it says it may cause drowsiness to use care when operating a vehicle ive never had any problems as far as being drowsy when i take it,1
i do occasionally when i know im going to be somewhere i could end up having an anxiety attack i take 2 i live in a rural area so i have to drive pretty much everywhere like i said ive never had any issues but everyone reacts differently,0
have your primary care or gyn do a hormone test check your thyroid and other possibly unrelated things that could be exacerbating your diagnosis especially during your time of the month thats probably a good start not always is it just a mental health issue and if there is any even the slightest increase of stress in your life can cause significant changes keep a journal and document it all and see if you cant pick up over the course of months what your pattern looks like and then take it to the doctor and let them help figure it out and the wrong medication could be doing you worse than good have you tried alternative therapy and treatments? if you are bipolar i suggest an antidepressant and mood stabilizer and something for the anxiety attacks and i really suggest trying marijuana for all of it your life will see the changes positively if your open to trying something different! i cant express it enough even with it being illegal in most states the statistics dont lie about its ability to effect the nervous system in a calming manner my opinion though,1
this is just what happen to me i got frustrated with the pms it was so sevier would really set off depression mood swings offten i was bad they gave me a iud calm everything down i am also bi polar anxiety adhd i take lamotragine has help i did not feel my best till they treated the adhd that can cripple your life depending on how bad left un treated,1
i was on this medicine for years and it never got any better i was on 600 mg twice a day on top of xanex 4 times a day and ambian at night when my diagnosis was changed to bpd from bipolar along with sever depression ptsd sever anxiety disorder & panic disorder i have been on different meds for bpd the withdrawal from lamotrigine are tough so if you do decide to change meds make sure to decrease slowly,1
did you ask your doctor if its a possibility that you may have borderline personality disorder with your mood swings being what they are? because i find when i was diagnosed with bipolar and they put me on medicine for it it didnt totally work i also was diagnosed with add anxiety ptsd ive now been told by my current psychiatrist that he thinks my diagnosis should be or added to of borderline personality disorder and suggest that i use dbt skills to help with my mood stabilization maybe this type of therapy can help you too,1
dbt is dialectical behavioral therapy it helps people that have a hard time regulating their moods and emotions often have feelings of abandonment suicidal thoughts or ideas long-term depression anxiety karma ptsd feeling like your life is just existing its a certain set of skills that you learn several different ones to help change these thoughts to more positive ways im sure if you google borderline personality disorder or dbt it can explain it better than i can,1
are you girls seeing gynocologist you may have hormonal disorders i had same problems was diagnosed with polysistic disorder although im also bp1 with panic anxiety kinda sounds like it coincides!,1
nikki shamell ,0
even though i have had professionals tell me i am a very strong person i still consider myself weak when im smiling im usually pretending because i dont want to make others uncomfortable i have missed too many events in my families lives to count because i couldnt put that pretend smile on my biggest regret was not being in my nephews lives i do cry in private at times but for the most part the tears wont come and i internalize my hurt i fight many battles that i keep to myself,0
 i didnt get a licences until i was 21 im almost 32 and can only drive in town limits on side roads without panic attacks so i have "routes" i take to get where i need to go at certain times when i know traffic is minimal aka agoraphobia btw population here is around 6000 town is literally like 5mines long max i have only driven on the highway twice since i started driving to test the amounts of anxiety and panic i get from the fast motion movement also not medicated besides as needed clonopin because my body reverses medication like magic passenger is twice as bad for me i usually always end up with a panic attack,1
they have changed my lifeinitially i thought they made me feel flat but then realised they had stopped all th background anxiety and my brain was quietthey also stabilised my mood swings x,1
im on setraline it takes a while to kick in but its the best thing i ever did i have bipolar disorder type two and anxiety disorder setraline is the best thing! whatever you do dont stop it even on days when you feel good i take mine at night it helps alot x,1
am on 100mg due to depression (which is pretty much under control now) and severe social anxiety for me it dampens the anxiety down far enough that i can function i still get anxious especially out in crowds but it doesnt affect me as much as it used to before i went on medication,1
its also an antidepressant i was on it for almost 2years for depression anxiety and ocd i thought it was great until i forgot to take it if i missed a day i was all over the place and would be mentally screwed for the day i was even at the point where i selfharmed which is definitely not me everyone is different tho,1
personally for low mood and anxiety id want to be on fluoxetine (prozac),0
i am in no way an expert but i think maybe you should have your dr put you on some newer drugs to try i am bipolar 1 ptsd social anxiety disorderand chronic depression i take wellbutrin in the morning plus a cans afternoon i have cans at bedtime i take two xanax and venlfaxine it works for me it manages all of my illnesses,1
why would they put you on gabapentin for stress and depression?? its a painkiller as far as i know and a strong one! it can have serious mood effects for some people one person i know ended up not being able to take it because he got really angry and lashed out on it the electric shocks you are having are a side effect of one of the pills you are taking and means that one of them isnt agreeing with you - you need to get off it and/or try something different this symptom is not normal nor should you tolerate it you could end up sicker i usually only got electric shocks when coming off them as a withdrawal symptom but i know others who got it while taking them and they had to change meds asap,1
i think its just extreme anxiety and depression i dont think anything else is acting up,1
slow down a little breathe dont panic understand that your fights effect your mental status talk yell cry to your therapist dont jump back in to the frying pan at least for awhile are you on meds?? with bipolar and anxiety disorders sounds like you are if not you might want to consider it with your dr now some meds can make you feel numb did for me anyway i too have bipolar and anxiety disorders along with others been on many many different med combos and have had the numbness talk with your dr/therapist let them guide you have also been in abusive relationships whether it be physical emotional or being abused mentally they all mess with your disorders clear your head before making any major decision in regards to hooking back up with him is it worth it?? you need to take care of you!! talk to yourselfask yourself questions answer yourself yes there will always be good times comforting times but keep in mind the rocky times and again ask yourself if its worth all that how much can you take?? but like i suggested talk with your dr and therapist it helps to get as much input as you can so you can choose what works for you!! i finally came to the point of saving myself from breakdown and that was after a plan of suicide good luck to you!! i hope you get alot of feedback here also youre in my prayers!! god bless!!,1
i too have bi polar mixed bi polar and anxiety i often feel numb and doubt if i should be in a relationship i would love to be able to give you some advice but if you are anything like me when some one tries to help me it becomes all scrambled up in my head because of the anxiety all i can say is dont make a decision because you feel guilty for another person you have to do what you feel if you make the decision out of feeling guilt for the other person then it will make things worse for you and the other person but it always has to be what you want ok dont take this to heart ok its just my way of thinking good luck x,0
do not make a decision until you feel stabilized i would also discuss this with a supportive individual therapist or doc all mine tell me that my partner is creating an atmosphere that makes my disease worse in a cyclic manner so i may feel better for a bit and then crash again repeat (abusive) he controls everything and it is scary! i have not been stable for a long time - years,0
i have bipolar 1 and anxiety ive been married 31 years and can tell you nothing is easy i tell my wife that i love her the best way i know how but sometimes i just suck at loving i think the part about feeling nothing for someone is more a part of the disorder than real emotions when i get to feeling apathetic in my heart i use my brain my logic to reason with my self that i care deeply for those i love im 51 years old and i think fighting lessens with age i also dont believe there is one perfect person were supposed to be with the question to ask is "is he a decent guy?if i had a grown daughter would i want her to be with a guy like this?" if so then probably a guy worth fighting for remember that you are a person worthy of love regardless of some diagnosis some doctor gave you be the best version of youokay i think that last part i saw on that show the office but you get the gist best of luck,0
i remember feeling numb in the past its horrible being told by your doctor that you have no feelings im also going through a medication change all i want to do is sleep and drown the voices out with music on my mp3 player dont worry i know my medication is causing this like amber murder aguero says try to talk to him explaining how you feel its not unusual to feel numb do you blame him for any of your troubles if so its love you go against the people you love the most,0
i have bipolar depression- anxiety schizophrenic and ptsd so i am struggling beyond measure to not be an emotional wreck,1
i been on mixed if meds for depressionanxietybi-polar and after years of trial and errors finally founds one that work without a lot side effects but depends on the person for what works for them,1
yes i am trying that too i started this year went off my meds find out the meds were making me worse decicded to try other things i take a vit for your brain helps with stress memory mood and vit d3 and others also do essential oils there are recipes for all driffrent mental disorders and i found 3 for bipolar were you mix oils together and put them on your back of neck and forhead and wrist seem to help me,1
be careful with st johns wort one side effect is agitation/anxiety i learned that the hard way,0
sam-e decent mood stabilizer valerian root can help some when taken at onset of anxiety its also decent for headaches and muscle cramps/spasms it is a sedative and muscle relaxant so please keep this in mind when taking it,1
no problem! i take a mg supplement with my meds just fine -its an element that the body naturally needs and it helps muscle tension and constipation (by loosening the digestive tract - one common product is milk of magnesia used to treat constipation it is in the hydroxide form it also draws water from the intestines which helps soften feces and make them easier to pass) i also do a mg regime after a hard conditioning workout for hockey or after a long training run it helps alleviate some of the soreness the next day epsom salt baths are particularly good for this purpose (i actually use it in an ice bath to cut down the inflammation same as you would with a cold pack but for my entire body instead of a localized area) the us rda on it is 400-420 mg per day for men about 300 for women it comes in several different forms among them glycinate citrate and oxide i i know there is a minor contraindication with xanax and magnesium oxide but it is very rare considered to be clinically irrelevant some forms will mess with the gut more than others - i cant take citrate but glycinate is good for me it is in my vitamin regimen with the blessing of my doctor even though i take an insanely high dosage and my body tolerates it well (more than you ever needed to know about mg im sure! but its one of my staples for several issues) also you cant really overdose on it - whatever the body cant use it will excrete,1
i had a similar reaction to all the meds i was given i came off all meds about a year agoit was really hard as it made me really ill even with doctors supervision since then i have cbt cognitive behavioural therapy i make fruit smoothies with as many antioxidants frits as i can i also add protein powder on top of that i walk 2/3 hours a day eat small amounts of red meat lots of veggies i have regular blood tests to make sure my body has enough vitamin dc and ion ext i have never felt so good i know its still early days but i find the more natural i keep my diet it really helps my moods the walking is very important other exercises would also help but i find the exercise in the outdoors is best for me i stopped drinking alcohol as this effect my moods and anxiety a lot im also trying to learn meditation to do before bed then put on relaxing music to fall to sleep with no voice just relaxing sounds this together with the above has been more successful for me than any mesds  it is just as important to do this daily as you would take your meds  i have bipolar 2 and suffer with anxiety i hope this information is useful please never come off any medication with at consulting you doctor some doctors think only mesds will work but i disagree for me i also have the ability to use my bipolar mind which is my favourite part to achieve amazing things meds block that part ❤️,1
i diffuse essential oils to help me sleep and deal with my anxiety and depressive phases along with my medsi havent had to increase any meds for 3 yrs now,1
i use cannibis for my bad days i dont smoke it i eat it cook it into stuff that i can munch on with out going nuts it helps so much especially since i dont use it to get high just to help sleep or take care of the bad days i have depression anxiety and bipolar,1
i have heard where there is medical marijuana they do prescribe it for mental problems i smoke for years self medicating for my adhd and anxiety i couldnt work with out it but being against the law tried to quit for years finally did now on disablity i suck at the jobs i do i have a small one now i think will work but something to be said for the thc,1
i have been able to cut my meds in half with medical marijuana saved my life i take my diazepam just a few times a month if i get night terrors i still need rx meds seroquel at night to sleep and as a mood stabilizer two birds ,1
i havent tried many things but i know that lavender helps with anxiety and stress,1
i havent but if you are still on prescription medication please consult your dr before starting natural remedies i know for one st johns wart is used to treat mild depression and anxiety but it can cause serious side effects when mixed with antidepressants,1
seek out a good holistic dr they will guide you please dont be scared off by all this interactions not to mention there are better things than st johns wart st johns wart is heavily advertised but its not the only nor best natural anti-depressant,0
here is what i assume to be fairly exhaustive list of interactions: do not take this medicine if you are taking any of the following medicines:  all hormonal contraceptives – the birth control ‘pill’ emergency contraception (also known as “the morning after pill”) hormonal implant creams patches intra-uterine devices with hormones  all medicines for depression/anxiety – amitriptyline clomipramine moclobemide citalopram fluoxetine paroxetine sertraline duloxetine venlafaxine  all hormonal replacement therapy (hrt) treatments – hrt tablets patches gels vaginal rings  all medicines for thinning the blood (anticoagulants) – warfarin acenocoumarol  all medicines for epilepsy – carbamazepine phenobarbitone phenytoin primidone sodium valproate  all immunosuppressant medicines – ciclosporin tacrolimus  all medicines for hiv infections – amprenavir atazanavir darunavir fosamprenavir indinavir lopinavir nelfinavir ritonavir saquinavir tipranavir efavirenz nevirapine delaviridine  some medicines for cholesterol – simvastatin atorvastatin  some medicines for cancer – irinotecan dasatinib erlotinib imatinib sorafenib sunitinib etoposide mitotane  some medicines for heart disease - digoxin ivabradine amiodarone  some medicines for migraine - almotriptan eletriptan frovatriptan naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zolmitriptan  some medicines for high blood pressure - amlodipine nifedipine felodipine verapamil  a medicine for regulating mood – lithium  a thyroid hormone - thyroxine st john’s w ort may also affect the following medicines therefore do not take this medicines at the same time unless a doctor has said it is safe to do so:  fentanyl propofol sevoflurane midazolam (anaesthetics/pre-operative medicines)  tramadol (an analgesic)  erythromycin clarithromycin telithromycin (antibiotics)  itraconazole and voriconazole (antifungals)  artemether and lumefantrine (antimalarials)  rasagiline (for parkinson’s disease)  aripiprazole (an antipsychotic medicine)  buspirone (an anxiolytic)  aprepitant (used to treat post-operative vomiting)  butobarbital and phenobarbital (barbiturates)  methyl phenidate (a central nervous system stimulant)  exemestane (a hormone antagonist for breast cancer)  eplerenone (a diuretic or water tablet)  lansoprazole and omeprazole (proton pump inhibitors for heartburn)  theophylline (a bronchodilator for breathing problems)  gliclazide (for diabetes),1
if i dont express my feelings get them out i explode! i have never wallowed! i have shoved away and pretended that its all ok thats not learning anything so your statement is kinda hurtful and condescending (i suffer from bipolar severe depression social anexity fear of abandonment and lots more) js,1
me too i used too too do that im on trazadone 200 milograms and i sleep through the night was taking three different things since im allergic to benadryl i cant take that but ive been sleeping so not worried i also take abilify and other meds been on medicine since i was four the youngest case of bipolar theyd seen at scott and white,1
i take seroquel and ambien and i still struggle to sleep but it did get better when i got prescribed ambien,1
emdr is incredible!!! i cannot praise it enough! i was offered it for ptsd several years ago and ill admit i was skeptical however it worked and things that i couldnt ever stand thinking about i can now talk about without feeling upset all over again the science behind how it works is fascinating! good luck! xx,0
caused sedation nausea restless legs tremors and grogginess all day long even taking it the night before i felt like a slave to it so glad im off it now,0
made me incredibly tired severe weight gain night terrors and terrible nightmares caused an incredible sugar craving as well i went up to 800mg a day but eventually stopped it,1
i had to increase higher every month because i absorb and get used to things fast i felt more anxious at night which didnt help but it makes me fall asleep every night which is amazing for me!! didnt help with anything else though that i wanted it to though but everyone is obviously different!!!,1
im currently on it to help me sleep and use 25mgs just when needed i used it earlier in the year also for anxiety i love it! it helped reduce the anxiety/panic to a manageable level and it helped me sleep deeply at night without that awful drugged hangover feeling you get from sleeping pills and apparently it isnt addictive although as im trying to cut down the usage i have to wonder if it is addictive or maybe im just addicted to a decent nights sleep lol?,1
i love how seroquel has helped me i am able to sleep without paranioa and hearing voices i even wake up well rested refreshed and in a good mental head space the only thing is it makes me a horrible midnight snacker  therefore i gained a lot of weight now im not as heavy  all i did to curve the weight gain was i took all my favorite snack foods and replaced them with healthier alternatives and plus i walk to exercise i take 300mg at night before bedtime the only other nuisance is that some days it takes about 1-2 hours to take effect but most of the time it knocks me out in 45 minutes ,1
lots of side effects at 300 mg a day but saved my life helps with paranoia and suicide thoughts,0
i bet it will help u gosh it sure did me youll over come the side effects enough to realize the benefit ( being alive ) i take other stuff too but the paranoia and self harm help is totally credited to seriquil im not to proud to admit it saved my life big hug 2 u for what your dealing with i have been there,1
horrible nightmares that were so real i would wake up super anxious and tearful,0
trouble swallowing restless legs weight gain tremors it worked great for my mood and sleep but the side effects were too much for me to handle,1
meds are individual i ha shakes really bad phycotic visions,0
i have been on seroquel for about 4 years- it definitely causes a lot of sedation- have no idea how people take it during the day and weight gain is a likely side effect as well i was up to 350 and then decreased to 200 and it was the most uncomfortable process i have ever been through severe body aches sweating nausea and an out of control mood so just take the minimum that will control your symptoms as getting the dose down will be hard,1
im on 200mg at first i got restless leg really bad on the lower dose and now at 200 they are gone i do get the munchies after i take it and ive gained weight on it but overall it seems to work for me,0
youll get fat and tired restless leg syndrome,0
i took it for a while 300mg i would take it and within 15 mins i was knocked out asleep i would take it at sleepovers and my friends would make fun of me bc id start babbling incorrectly and pass out id sleep with no minimum of 9 hours and getting off of it was a bitch withdrawal and irritability were making my life hell then but as a medication for mood stability it worked very well probably one of the best ive taken faitige is the main down fall,1
made my anxiety worse/made me restless couldnt wake up from deep sleep would eat everything in my path,1
it gave me restless legsand i was always sleeping,0
i struggle with this daily,0
scariest place ever,0
my dearest sister i am soooooosorry that i embarrassed you it was not meant to be that way i will always love you as i recall we spoke on the telephone just a few days ago you offered no help at all i know you can not be hear and i know you cant afford a lot i just wished for hope doris does nothing so its all stuck on me i do not appreciate that i have filled for section 8 then i wont have nothing to do with dad,0
sometimes medication isnt always the answers i used to struggle to sleep most nights  brain over thinking to many things  or id fall asleep and then have a disturbed sleep maybe wake up to 6 times  i always try go bet at the same time as it gets me into a routine (like you would as a child) then i listen to music on youtube  music for anxiety  music for insomnia  theres so many  and some of them play for the whole 8 hours and i find there the ones that help me stay asleep  if they are just quick ones that send you off and only last 40 mins im up again within two hours  your ears are the only thing that dont sleep  i found this really helped me along side taking my mood stabilisers and anxiety tablets,1
so simple and so cheapcelestial seasoning sleepy time tea im not exaggerating it works as well as any sleeping pill ive taken without any side effects i was most recently on restoril and it worked but it was literally making me sick so i decided to stop taking it i was terrified of not being able to sleep and my psychiatrist asked me to just give the tea a try with my regular night time meds it knocked me out all night i woke the next morning completely shocked that i had sleptwith no nightmares i couldnt remember anything just deep warm relaxed sleep and i had no morning migraine or nausea like every other day on restoril its amazing but i guarantee you 999% docs are not going to suggest it cost $398 for a box of 20 worth twenty times that! good luck ,1
what a horrible message to reinforce to someone who struggles so they have enough issues with self defeat they need to see messages of their worth,0
my boyfriend had stuck around i live in fear of him leaving meeveryone leaves as i have nothing positive to offer anyone,0
no worries ,0
actually i prefer to be know as a manic depressivebipolar is often confused with schizophrenia,1
yeah they take a psychotropic concoction called ayahuascaa mixture of dmt and monoamine oxidiser inhibitorsthey also use it for chronic drug addiction dont think it would go well with lithium though ,1
no i am not i do recommend epilim over lithium for high or low blood pressure hawthorne tablets work,1
blood pressure off the charts tho,0
i think first of all you must have a happy life before deside to try a quit medications i been trying sometimes and i am trying right now but i am very calm and "happy" that helps but i notice i get upset more easy than with medication  good luck,1
you shouldnt have to feel nervous- its our bodies i was on lamictal and wellbutrin (and a few others!) and just one week dropped my dose then the next week dropped it again then i was off and i did great! ive traded all my meds for clean eating exercise and essential oils its something i have to plan and work on daily but its natural abd my body feels great no more side effects from all those meds! ❤️ good luck and listen to your own body!,1
well what works well for one person may not for another tell your dr that these particular meds make you feel nervous maybe even edgy some meds that ive been on in the past made me feel like i was going to crawl out of my skin! so tell you dr they will then start lowering your dosage and try a different med plenty of meds out there so it may take time to find the right combo if you plan to stop taking them on your own before you can get in to see your dr taperr off them very slowly very slowly cut back a pill at a time but do it every couple 2 weeks if not 3 weeks yes it is a slow process but dont stop abruptly!!! the risks are far to dangerous!! ive had to taper off many meds that made me feel uncomfortable so i speak with many years experience if you can see your dr asap thats the best way to go dont be discouraged that these 2 meds arent working for you like i said theres many many more to try hopefully you find this helpful youre in my prayers!!,1
do you want to be mentally stable or do you want to worry about your size? theres still ways to maintain a healthy weight wether youre on meds or not,0
obsessed with philosophyto the point where like in the matrix took the red pill no going back the "human world" as opposed to the natural world seems so strange to me,1
doesnt sound like its you in this situation if he has a girlfriend but is not s cheater he probably shouldnt be hanging around you if hes got feelings anyhow when im in an episode i talk super fast but then start to stutter i get very irritated by that but that makes it worse i end up doing s mental breathing moment and it gets a little better you could say to your friend that not everyone has the same life experiences just breathe a little,0
i hear you i prefer to have more meaningful conversations with people and that makes it difficult and awkward to talk to people who dont want to think a bit deeper,0
hes not a friend sadly the world is filled with these people they are manipulative and self-centered and with time you will learn to avoid them because you will understand that you are much better than this youre on higher grounds and they dont like that they want to drag you down and you dont need toxic people in your life even if that means having to be on your own i can tell you briefly about my personal experience with these people read on if that interests you: i had best friends they were 4 we used to hang out together all the time for 7+ years we were like brothers then came that night when they were all hanging out at one of them as usual so i went up to see them and they started attacking me one said im a bitch one said im a hypocrite and a liar one said im insignificant and the last one just told me that since his "brothers" think of me that way then he wants no connection with me i tried to explain things but they werent listening it was like talking to walls so i hurriedly rushed out of the apartment drove my car fast away from them i was crying i felt miserable when i arrived home i noticed a text from one of them saying: "are you on drugs?" it was the most hurtful text i have ever received i will never forget this text instead of saying something nice they still wanted to hurt me some more i never replied and i never saw them again it was a shock for me not having friends especially that i lost touch with everyone else during these 7 years i tried to make connections it never worked i still feel the emptiness of being alone 10 years later but im growing tougher now im learning that i dont need people to feel good that i can do my own thing by myself i still miss having friends around though but then i remember that story and i think to myself perhaps im better off this way,0
im sorry your feeling hurt sometimes my husband acts similarly and i get so anxious since he at this point is just a friend i would let this relationship go you deserve so much better there are people that understand mental illness and are kind i will keep you in my prayers,0
is it really necessary to be rude to someone obviously struggling? does that make you feel better about yourself?,0
bless your heart im scared all the time you can make it through this,0
ive been where you are feeling like there is no other option but death is sad and scary :( ive been hospitalized quite a few times for suicidal thoughts and attempts this can be a lonely and scary time please know that all of us care and hope you can get to a healthier emotional place soon!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
i live in the united states i wish i knew more about your area to help you im also suicidal at times but i know that my life is worth it and that theres people in my life that love me and they would really be saddened if i wasnt here anymore and thats what i have to keep telling myself dont be afraid to go to a mental hospital they will help you and get you the right treatment that you need and reinforce those good things that you have about yourself and hopefully change your thinking were you can feel good about yourself from the inside and dont need other people to validate that for you i will be thinking about you and putting you in my prayers feel free to text me anytime if you need to talk,0
be strong its your lifedo it for youdont scared they will help youjust sleep eat and chill in the unitthe nurses are amazing people,1
one of my friends calls the physc ward the "crayon box" probably cause you get to color in some of them sometimes it can be peaceful there like a mini vacation people take care of you and you dont have to worry about your problems,0
heyyamy father was in the same situation a couple of months ago he felt anxiety breathlessness wanted to end his life but i would recommend you to visit a good psychiatrist and get proper meds  meds help a lot due to which he recovered nothing was working for him but the meds helped him in the end and please do not take such a step! life is worth fighting forwe are with you!,1
sending you lots of love and positive energy everyday is a struggle for me im glad someone was looking over you and hope you find the care youre needing right now ❤,0
you are doing the right thing and you will be alright dont be scared its not as bad as you would think im sending many blessings to you,0
read thiswe are all broken but our brokenness serves a purpose my pastor shared this little story todayits good the cracked pot a water bearer in india had two large pots each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck one of the pots had a crack in it and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the masters house the cracked pot arrived only half full for a full two years this went on daily with the bearer delivering only one and one half pots of water in his masters house the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments perfect to the end for which it was made but the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do after two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream "i am ashamed of myself and i want to apologize to you" "why?" asked the bearer "what are you ashamed of?" "i have been able for these past two years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your masters house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts" the pot said the water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot and in his compassion he said "as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path" indeed as they went up the hill the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path and this cheered it some but at the end of the trail it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load and so again it apologize to the bearer for its failure the bearer said to the pot "did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side? thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house",0
its not scary at all itll give you some help,1
im sorry an its not that scary there theyll take good care of you,0
positive energy coming your way and a great big hug ive been there i was hospitalized in june and it was scary but the people were incredibly nice and so helpful i wish you all those things hang in there just take one moment at a time and breathe <3,0

dont be afraidyou will be helped to become well again,1
you are not alone this is a journey of lifes ups and downs you may not hear or even see the words with the responses youll receive today and days after i dont know you im not sure of your struggles i wont say "i know how you feel" because youre special i will say "ive been where you are right now" i thank god everyday for life we survivors all are embrace who you are go for a walk and smell some flowers  the fact that youve written about your night means youre way stronger and wiser than you give yourself credit for i dont know you but i love you we are sisters or sister/brother life would be terrible if you forced an event that isnt natural we are meant to follow our purpose sometimes you dont know what that purpose is until one day it just clicks you are love ❤️ you are lovable you are loving hoffman process/institute pls look it up,0

it will be a safe place a place where people will make sure you are ok just remember that there will be others just as scared as you you will be ok!,0
im a sh survivor i know the pain of depression anxiety and being alone you can get through this baby steps one day at a time change doesnt happen over night but it does happen you are courageous for reaching out for help keep using your courage to reach out you can do this much love,0
there is hopebelieve u r worth itdont be scared of phsyc ward they r there to help but u must believe ur worth it cause u r there r solutions to problems dont give up u r loved ,1
i hope and pray you get the needed help so you may feel whole again i have a friends son that is currently reaching out that is feeling hopeless! i took him in to my home long enough to where he did seek help and is now feeling better! nothing to be ashamed of we have all been to the bottom of the pit at times you are going forward with what you need to do for yourself be proud of that never make permanent decision on a temporary thought someone out there needs you ty for aharing,0
sending lots of love to you do not fear being admitted i have been there many times but i did eventually get through it all the very best to you,0
first: you are getting help pat yourself on the back for this or give yourself a hug - well done that is the first step on a scary road! secondly: all mental health units feel scary as they can have noisy (and nosy) people there what you have to remember is that these people dont judge you need help and that is what they are there for tell the truth try to explain how you feel others are there for the same reason as you it takes some time but there is light at the end of that horrible dark miserable tunnel! it doesnt seem like it yet but the light is there! you just need a hand to help you find the light switch i have been where you are it is terrible and my heart goes out to you truly strange as it may seem you will meet some great people in the unit who are similar to you but who have been there a few times where this is your first time take some deep breaths try not to judge yourself too harshly and take each day as it comes we are all here for you❤️❤️❤️,0
how very good people can be so heart-warming lisa in this sometimes terrifying world much love to you brave heart that you arex,0
be glad you are alert and oriented in because thats really really even more scary when you are hallucinating and do not know what is real and what its not because ive had a psychotic episode with this it just got so severe with my ptsd but im really really glad that youre getting help honey please take the help its really going to be okay,0
you are worth living i am so happy that youre at the psych ward that you definitely need to be there honey just to get things in perspective but you can do this we just have to find the right counselor to help you get through it and please dont hesitate to post in this group im really happy you that youre there and you made it and youre going to get through this,0
hang on get help you are worth it dont allow your fears to keep you from meeting people who really want to help you they carea lot of them are on this line of work because they have been where you are,1
tw i you are worthy no matter what your struggles are; you are worthy our society tell us to look at the big contribution that an individual makes but i suggest that you look at the small ones you very presences lights up somebodies day; makes them feel like going on yes you are worthy and beautiful,0
you are absolutely not alone there are so many of us out here that are more than happy to be a good friend you see what my name is you are more than welcome at anytime you need to talk to pop up on my page or send me a message i dont want anybody to ever feel like theyre alone in this whole struggle,0
getting help for anything is hard getting help for mental illness is even harder just the fact that youre taking that step makes you stronger than youll ever be at this moment ive been in a psych ward it is scary the first time but its not that bad youll get the help you need and come out stronger!!,0
im a sufferer of depression and anxietyi always have to say to myself i am not alonebuild your wall around you dont let anyone or anything breakthrough it lots of ❤ xx,0
you got this dont be afraid we are here for you and we love you,0
ive been in and out of hospital the last 11 years nothing to be scared of man,0
thank you! it is so hard to apply this to myself but its easy to be there for others if that makes sense  i dont want to make this post about me but i will say hilary fredman every day is a struggle to just get out if bed,0
i was in for a month last year for two attempts it was so scary to me but now i am stable and feel really good hang in there and i will pray for you,0
im so sorry to hear this you will be ok there are people who care believe me i signed myself into one years ago and i am the better for it dont be afraid you reached out thats the first step to recovery god bless you and i will pray for you if you ever need a friend im here ,0
this resonated with me you really helped me just now im close to the edge and im seriously scaring myself,0
praying for you hosp should help tremendously go to groups n stay involved for best results everyone is there w their skeletons to so no shame in it,1
i was in one about two months ago its not as scary as you would think there are usually some very nice ppl in there and the staff wont let you come to any harm just try youre best and tell them whats going on in your life and they will help you they are there to help you its not a nice place but i definitely needed to be in there at the time as i wasnt safe because i tried to kill myself four times in a short time there is help afterwards too so pls just take the help x,0
i know its scary been there myself but remember that everyone there is going thru their own hell and can relate no one judges there youll get understanding and respect believe in yourself! my prayers are with you honey!!,0
i cried when i left ill never forget all the others that went through that chapter of my life with me (yes those 5 days felt like a whole chapter) i learned so much out about me and ever those around me! while in there make the best of it you are in there and you set the tone either be miserable or get the most out it!,0
man dont i know that feeling too well been there twice sending positive vibes sweetie the staff are very supportive if youre feeling any sorts of anxiety bout the whole scenario i had a meltdown on two nurses & they managed to calm me down,0
yes!im the same but then after woods i feel bad asking and talking and listening etcetc but then i feel very bad and worry about seen the people again!:(,0
vivi ann mephami appreciate your replymy friends dont understand the way i ammy family dont talk to me so its all meim 55 and my cptsd and depression anxiety and that major one "the way i see my future " its hellmy therapist (1st one)left town after 3 years of talking to her and now this new one is an interni just cant get to the source of all this i wanna get it all out and be done with it but it never goes awayguess my strength will still hold me upjust wish i didnt go through all this to end up dying aloneso sadgod bless us both,0
just ask your gp they do understand its not good to stop all at once because of side affects dont be afraid to ask the question but be prepared for the response sometimes we feel we can do without medication ive tried numerous times only to end up back on them,0
just say youd like to try and see how you could get on without tablets and could they help you wean off them im sure you already know you cant just stop tablets and least lowering it slowly is an aim and a goal i have bpd and its rather different to bp but its the similar principle also im in the uk so im unsure how the medical practising works over there if you feel you dont need them just talk to them if youre nervous take someone with you or write a note and give them it so they can understand good luck x,0
users and obnoxious men are the ones putting themselves out there cus they know what they want if an insecure woman doesnt feel wanted she wont notice you when you do dont be obnoxious but speak up and be honest i prob wouldnt be the only woman who would appreciate it if the nice guys stood up once and a while,0
it really depends often my own experiences etc are what make me awesome at my job cause people can tell that i genuinely empathize and my knowledge/experience allows to better help others but sometimes i find the stress/work hours/sometimes even the environments etc of nursing negatively impact my own mental health i love what i do know i am good at it but in all honestly there have been times ive considered changing careers and theres times i do struggle a bit really its something you have to decide on your own :) best wishes,0
i was a qualified nurse for 35 years with depressionanxiety and bpd but i have had to give it up as my shitty memory and dread od something going wrong did not make me a safe practioner it is knowing when to stop my mental health problems gave me more empathy with all my patients x x,1
im a nurse and have bipolar depression i believe this makes me a better nurse people see a mental illness as something terrifying its not it makes us stronger and more aware of other that suffer take your meds counselling and time for your mental health no one is allowed to discriminate against you you know your own limits be a great nurse and make a difference,1
i was an rn and had to retire 7 years ago my mental health was affecting my job and i was not risking med errors etc our jobs do not define us xxx,1
er if she wont go call a doctor to find out how you get an emergency psych hold you may need to see if she has a medical power of attorney she could be in a depressive psychosis which is no joke better safe than sorry dont worry about pissing her off better she be alive and pissed than dead,1
all i want is to be held tight lots of love and affection and to be reassured that the one person i need the most is there even if i try and push away i need them to pull me closer its fucked up when i act like i dont need them or want them when i really do - more then ever! worst thing to do is to leave them alone or go in a mood coz theyre being "ignorant or awkward by ignoring you" sometimes we want to talk and communicate but just cant as the words wont come out its horrible especially when asked "whats wrong" and we really dont know in my experience if someone trys to shut u out and push u away then pull them in closer tight affectionate hugs and kisses and just talk to them about anything and everything they may not respond for a while but they are listening and its taking their mind away from how they are feeling and pulling then back into the real word,0
mine is yes newly adjusted and they say it takes weeks to adjust the anxiety has increased since it was,1
you first need to work out weather you can handle this as this is not going to a one off if you can just be there lye with her hold her hand  sit with her just offer he a few reassuring words make her comfortable does she have a care plan of what she like when she poorly if not when she well make one so you have insight which help her it can be very distressing to watch and it normal to feel uselessthere not much that can be done apart from be understanding and make them comfortable and safe also look after yourself there is carers support out there too all the best all the best,1
do not do that!! unless she has taken something it will make it worst make the person feel shameful or just piss them off lots of love and heavy blankets!,0
i tend to do this on my partner best thing we do is put on something i love on netflix & snuggle up being there greatly comforts the pain gets overwhelming its never personal,0
make a fruit smoothy put honey and protein powder in it  i wouldnt put her meds by the bed but take them to her with a large glass of water give the house a good clean as i feel so guilty when i come round and i see all the things ive let go in my home you could always get some relaxing music just sound no voices meditation music you should maybe go and see her docter or therapist for advice you need someone to it will help you feel stronger  depending on how bad you think this is only you will know as you know her best she might need some outside support your amazing shes very lucky to have you and im sure you feel the same about her when she comes round tell her how proud you are of her and how much you love her shell probably feel really guilty and its a very fragile time fresh air and a walk in the peaceful country side is good when shes up to it x,0
and for god sake dont tell her shes faking it like my otherhalf just did when having a panic attack,0
i do this i know what would make me happy when im like this surround her with soft cosy stuff quilts blankets make her a safe nest you dont need words if shes happy for you to stroke her hair do it if not dont take it personally above all else right now she needs to feel secure quietly checking on her no loud noises dont try and move her from where she is even if she looks uncomfortable just create a nest around her this too shall pass she will return sending love xx,0
i do that honestly give her time to calm down sometimes it will be one or two days for me i dont want to talk or anything i get in an argument or stress or something and it makes me just shut down,0
just lie down beside herhold her and tell her you understand when i shut down like thisits because the pain is overwhelming and i cant thinkmove or talk i wish my husband would understand but he just yells at me and calls me lazy thats the worst thing to do,0
honey thats absolutely horrible i hope you find someone who deserves you real soon you are a good person even if some people dont want to see it,0
this person wasnt saying to give up!!! this person was struggling themselves and had been given up on and was simply reaching out i believe not in any way saying to give up on her but rather that in his experiences people have just given up he was saying to please stick it out and just give her space( just my opinion on it),0
im looking for advice hear  i suffer from depressiin and anxiety but ive been asked if i have bipolar twice during debates i have searched symptoms and cant really decide myself  can anyone give me advice please xxx,0
my fear is that i will no longer be the person i once was,0
i will always just survive day to day being around others and doing pretty much anything is sometimes an overwhelming effort i have to work a very simple job as i have avoid all stress as its a serious trigger i dont drive or have any skills due to all my effort being taken up with battling depression and anxiety for the past 20 years i take no pleasure in life and most if the time just want everything to end,1
i have anxiety to cope with but i try every day to cope and do my best its hard but im a survivor,0
manic for me is just restless and agitatedno grandiosity certainly doesnt feel good anyone else feel the same?,0
i hope it all works out for you i am new to this page a few years ago i had a meltdown at my job and threatened suicide thank goodness it was a human services agency and they understood that shit but i was out of work for a month and in a psych ward for a week it is only within the last 6 months i have my diagnosis i dont know if i will ever find the real me again sorry to go off in a different direction but you arent alone i had to give up records too hugs and good luck,1
yes everything seems to come to a head at night all the days stress,0
i have been panicking as shit and struggling to get up from bed but its because i now drive in a big city go to two colleges and for an 18 year old i never expected having so much independence would be so difficult so i guess it freaked me out but usually the first day of school doesnt freak me out and its my second year of college im sure it does have some effect cuz i have never felt so panicky about where my life was going i mean before ive been suicidal and i always thought it was going to be over soon but i felt ok with that and my thoughts and actions made me cry but it isnt the same as that panic ive been feeling,0
im feeling that to my anxiety is omg i went off on my husband and said lots of mean things im depressed moody sad crying i even told him cause im pms ing didnt want to go anywhere and we did and i regret every minute of it,0
wow so many wanna be doctors and comedians on a support sight im mentally disabled and today was a little touchy and everyone ignore the negativeand focus on good advice that helps dont feed into the miserables or youll only feel worse,0
i couldnt sleep last night at all and have woken up in a horrible upset mood ughhhh,0
yes iv been over anxious in build up to eclipse my normal meds not even dulling anxiety i often get this way during full moon tooi just do meditation to helpx,1
you have eclipse anxietyyeah i dont get it either,1
i just need to say that whether you agree or disagree with this post that is no need to put someone down for fucks sake we are all dealing with depression anxiety or other mental disorders and the ones putting other people down are probably why i understand you need to get happiness any way you can but if it means being a pompous ass then you have worse problems to deal with anyone should be able to ask anything without being made feel like they are stupid or crazy,0
i was super panicked all of the sudden this morning but it passed quickly i have been depressed the last week so maybe its a sign of new light coming at least i hope so,0
i hadnt thought of that and i have no idea if theres a connection but i always get hypomanic at the same time every month but this time its lasting a lot longer than usual-- i cant shake it and im also very depressed if weather can give me headaches who knowsmaybe theres something to this never say never i just wish itd go away,0
i have been shaking all day and not feeling my normal self dont know why no med changes but having trouble sleeping like i do when there is a new change this shaking is awful nothing seems to help this is definitely not in my normal realm of ups and downs,1
same diagnosis as you im usually stable but this shaking was strange,0
i am diagnosed with ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar but my meds keep me pretty stable i havent been at all today,1
im shaking too and i feel different in several different ways but i also get anxiety and such during each of the monthly full moons and after working in a neurophysiology lab at a psychiatric hospital for 35 years it was a known fact among the doctors that emotions became restless and rage became more prevalent it does affect me everyone is different,1
i feel so much pressure building up inside of me i feel i may just explode,0
science has proved that it can have an effect on the mind before any of you jackasses keep judging this poor girl research before you open your ignorant mouths that being said girl im right there with you my depression and anxiety definitely have been kicked up a notch ,1
i agree my moods have been horrible! ive been really hating everything!,0
just like the full moon has no effect on the elderly? ive worked in healthcare for years and i can tell you without a doubt it does nasa also likes to say there is no evidence of extraterrestrial life too,0
while i dont personally ascribe to celestial intervention some people feel anxiety about events like this and it might be affecting you! do what makes you feel more comfortable or maybe watch the nasa stream and experience something cool take care of yourself,0
im looking for some science to back up the idea that it does and im struggling to find any from a reputable source do you have any?,0
struggling here too,0
im definately having problems with my emotions and a headache that keeps getting worseany stimulation at all overwhelms mehiding in my room,0
a lot of anxiety,1
i dont know if its the eclipse but im cycling i just went through the angry rage hate and irritability of hypomania and now im in the very deep hole of depression god i hate this disease ,0
tracy hypomania for me manifests in anger rage irritability and wanting to yell and scream and throw things and punch people in the throat its so much different than mania i dont get super highs super creative and go on major spending sprees sometimes the hypomania also gets mixed with depression too it is really awful im in the middle of hypomania right now i have such hate and anger going on it sucks and im going through a divorce so im that doesnt help hes been lying and cheating for 9 months!! the bastard,0
like that time i made my daughter a birthday cake filled with lollies i was up so late making it and was so confused as to why it was hard for her to cut needless to say when the lollies came falling out i was just as surprised as she was! ya just gotta laugh sometimes!!,0

you can be insecure but dont let your fears blox you,0
yes reality is very scary to me,0
i also had to sign that form but i didnt mind takes the stress off menow i dont have to explain the psychologist can do that but they are not allowed to speak to my psychiatrist she doesnt want to,1
i wish i had this help available when i was having issues at work instead they were all afraid of me and then one (who was a friend turned jerk) tried getting me fired with hr reports well i left for a better job and worked on my health she was caught a couple months later stealing on camera cherry topper we worked at a large corporate bank,1
going through the exact thing right now im fortunate enough to have a dr who is really patient with me and willing to run any health test to reassure me that im ok i take it one day at a time i take deep breaths keep taking my meds talking to a mental health professional and reminding myself im not alone hang in there the one thing that has been helping me a lot lately is reminding myself that my true sickness is my anxiety disorder everything else is just false and my irrational thinking comes from my anxiety and if i am sick its normal people get sick all the time it doesnt mean youre going to die,0
all who are suffering i have been there also be assured that this also comes and goes you fill as though youre suffocating when panic sets in i find talking to a friend or anyone who can take it mind to a different place will get u through it find that place i pick up my guitar it helps you will become frightened and that makes it worse im older and have dealt with it for many years  be assured youre not dying keep a blood pressure pulse monitor with you as you calm down your pulse will stabilize save yourself time money and embarrassment finding the proper med combination will help greatly ur drs will find them talk weekly with phycotheripest dont miss appointments help them help you!!!,1
so am i and im slowing dieing inside i wish everyday my heart would just stop beating in my sleep my family just dont know how to deal with it or have their own opinions about me i dont wish this on anyone but it they could experience this for a least one minute maybe they could have a little compassion complex ptsd acid reflux anxity panic attacks copd dealing with this alone and been reaching out for help from drs and give me anti depressants and anxity meds none work anxity meds make me to groggy so i dont take them i cant work like this so i have no income trying to survive physically mentally and financially getting worse where im giving up hope to keep looking for the right dr im exhausted and wore out,1
i struggle also but on to a new treatment it is called tms therapy  my pcp is all for it it has a 86 percent chance to cure you i said its better to try,0
i get it sometimes i panic when my husband falls asleep even though hes right beside me cause then i feel alone again,0
i cant sleep and i try going to bed but my mind just races and i just think horrible thoughts and am so alone x,0
i have the same issue cant go on overnight trips or anything without severe anxiety,1
sertraline saved my life seriously ive been taking it off and on for years and its the only medication that works well for both my anxiety and depression note: some docs wont tell you this but make sure to eat with it good luck!,1
personally i didnt react well on it after three days i couldnt stand it made my anxiety skyrocket made me dizzy and nauseous light headed and just generally feel crap,0
i took it at the end of last year for depression and anxiety i found it made my anxiety worse for the first couple of weeks then it settled down i never shook the awful headaches it kept giving me after a few months so came off it everyone is different though so just track any changes and if you arent feeling better talk to your doctor about changing i hope it works for you though!,1
i am on sertraline 200mg for deoressionbut feel it isnt working i just feel constantly down and scared its effecting my marraige can anyome suggest anything? i cant pin point what makes me down but its so hard to just "snap out of it",0
my pharmacist : " you will feel absolutely horrible for the first two weeks dont stop taking it though you just have to get through the first two weeks" the first two weeks were god damn awful in the end i needed a higher dose but i couldnt afford to go back to my dr it helped my anxiety a lot ( i went from having multiple moderate to severe anxiety attacks every day to like one manageable one) but made me very aloof i wasnt sad anymore but thats because i couldnt really access any of my emotions not sure if that helps but that was my experience with it i would consider going back on a higher dose if i could ( no health insurance at the moment),0
ive been on setraline for almost a year and had no side effects when i started but ive recently gone up to 100mg and im getting the worst brain zaps but they are helping so i just work through it i have depression anxiety and traits of borderline personality disorder and they seem to be working for me :),1
i take 75mg for depression which works really well for me i also take quetiapine at night (or through day for anxiety) and they work well for me,1
started on it 2 months ago and it has been life changing fori do have depressionanxiety and borderline personality at first i felt "flat" and emotionless but then realised it was my background anxiety had stopped so my brain was quieter if that makes sensei totally agree with the dry mouthwe are slowly increasing the dose till hopefully i will have peace x,1
it affects us differently so dont be scared if it doesnt work for you theres always others that you could try but it could suit you fantastically so its got to be worth trying with myself i was worried at first as id tried a few other anti depressants but after trying 50mg for a few weeks i realised it was good and went up to 100mg there have been a few side affects on the way but not as bad as some others and in the long run its made a noticeable difference try it and see what happens and if it doesnt suit you then you can always try another drug,0
i started on 50mg and then 75mg after 3 weeks anxiety is definately much better ive been on sertraline for along time and lithium and both suit me well,1
i take 300mg its not helping with my anxiety or my depression because they have added another antidepressant i take 13 pills at night for bipolar with severe anxiety i havent experienced any of these side effects i have had no side effects at all,1
i love it! i take it for my manic depression and it does wonders!! it doesnt seem to help me with my anxiety though were about to up my dose to see if it will (currently on 100mg) but yeah i get dry mouth a lot but its a good way for me to have to stick to my 8 glasses a day definitely worth the small side effect for the huge relief,1
i was started on 50mg but it aremy depression worse also very dry mouth with it horrible medication to take everyone is different though give it time to go into your system and see how u get on x,1
keep a journal when you start so you can tell you doctor what if any symptoms you are having taking it i am only on xanax for anxiety 25 mg,1
started on 50mg was increased to 100mg & then to 150mg i find it dries me up something fierce but that may be the mix of my other meds (carbemazepine leviteracitam & diazepam) as well id been told that higher doses of sertraline could work for anxiety as well as depression but right now im only indicated for depression,1
i really struggled with sertraline it made me worse,0
i take 200 mg i suffer with severe ocd and it has made my life so so much better it has also decreased my anxiety it changed my life!,1
im not schizophrenic and i hear a voice that isnt my own mental voice but i have dissociative depersonalisation disorder and ptsd its always a good idea to speak to your doctor about your worries i believe there are tests that can help pinpoint the issue,1
yes--a psychiatrist there are excellent treatments for anxiety and depression now hearing voices can be many things: psychosis due to your severe depression and anxiety or a dissociative disorder stemming from some trauma this is something that may require some hard therapy but the help is out there!,1
depends if it is two separate voices that sound different or like me i call them lots of "me" trying to talk to me in my head at once which get more noisey if i am anxious or depressed x,1
my sincere apologies to all who i offended yes brigitte garvin as that trauma induces mental disorders thank you for your time signing off this website i thought it was for folks who had mental disorders and desperately seeking insight from others who also are seeking any and all insight ill try anything that has worked for someone else just to feel a little better just remember cmx ,1
i have been bipolar since i was 6 years old i know about misdiagnosis! 49 years 45 of those years self medicating with alcohol and numerous drugs started at 12 years old ive been medicated for 8 years now ive been on 10 different anti depressants 5 mood stabilizers librium zanax clonaxapam chantix abilify well thats all i remember off the top of my head still havent found a cocktail that works i struggle everyday just to get out of bed and have for 12 years everyone i read about a mental illness that im not familiar with i have my provider test me for it paranoia will destroy ya someone in crisis asked a question and i gave an honest answer and sound advice you kinda left that part out just sayin! 4 1/2 years ago i started to design a support group specifically for women with mental disorders once i got it all put together i presented it my psych provider she thought it was awesome 3 years ago she started this group nobody would even look up let alone talk they are now thriving happy enjoying life some for the first time i have been working on the next step for a year now with the same psych provider i am so excited to get the next stage implemented it brings the greatest joy to my heart that my inspirations have made such a positive impact for 6 survivors 6 out of 6 ,0
yes i have a heart! i suffer from several disorders i have been screened for schizophrenic as well as others i have had the same psych provider for 8 years we have discussed schizophrenia bipolar 1 and 2 ocd ptsd anxiety disorder panic attacks paranoia adhd racing thoughts as well i have deeply researched these as well aside from being schizophrenic i have all of those disorders,1
theres many different causes of voices actually trauma bipolar personality disorders did stress you cant just tell someone theyre schizophrenic do you not know how intimidating that is!! do you have no heart?,1
take care of yourself first!!! let him go completely then start building up your self-esteem do things you have always wanted to do alone make new friends move live life let go of all negative people rely on yourself only when you have started a new life and you are happy in that new life will you meet someone who will enrich your life you dont want to be with a person who leaves you questioning or feeling sad and unsure i wish you all the best you got this,0
okay every time i go to my gp they just offer me antidepressants i finally found a counsellor who gave me different coping methods for depression not one person listen to me when i try and talk about the difference in my days some days i can hardly motivate myself to move other then to grab the worst of food and binge eat till i feel sick and online shop other days i wake up and i clean the whole flat in an hour and we are all up dressed and ready to get out the flat and spend the day out doing things that i can really afford i find my hard days are always triggers by the silliest things someone told me ive done something wrong at work or ive felt the tiniest bit rejected by a loved one or ive been in a flunk for over an hour so now my whole day now ends up that way before learning slightly heather coping mechanisms i used to drink a bit party hard and use sex as a way to escape from the overwhelming feeling of being stuck in my head but evening with these new coping skills i feel like there is never just a normal day i try to trust my gp and tell myself its just depression and maybe its anxiety that makes me feel like its more then what it is what are you thoughts?,0
thanks for your reply i hear that from a lot of people about kids giving them hope being without kids though i cant really relate to that one very much i hear ya on music though i have to listen to music everyday so many songs give me a sense of meaning and empowerment its almost as if theres a continuous message to be taken from music that everyone can relate to your comment does help because i dont get out much and dont have any friends really (my own fault- social anxiety) and to hear from someone who i can relate to on some level also gives me hope thank you,1
mood swings no doubt,0
tristen does have bipolar but i do not feel the need to share all the details with anyone the only thing im gonna say is she was the youngest child ever diagnosed with it by a psychiatrist at scott & white mental health tristen also has a slight learning disorder so she does get confused about things we did not wait a year for labs or meds to be given,1
three seems kind of weird also to be diagnosed at three and then not treating you until your 4? what exactly do you mean blood drawn at 4 1/2? i dont want to sound rude but i am here for information and support i am new to all this and very scared i would really be quite pissed to be honest if someone was saying they have a sickness they dont have,0
thats just what my textbook says just like hypo and hyper blood tension,0
im 59 and when i was growing up mom was manic depressive we knew she was manic when shes be up in the middle of the night cleaning sometimes talking to the wall etc i rarely mentioned her illness when young stays in mental hospitals now as an adult her illness is nothing to be ashamed of my momma fought the fight every day love her rip momma,0
sue furst - i had no idea what you endured! i wish i would have known - we have been dealing with natashas struggle with depression and anxiety luckily she us doing very well right now i love susie q!,0
barbara i feel for you ♡ its a tough tough illness my mothers struggle hospitals meds electric shock therapy (made her sad to think about that horror) her illness is why i chose not to have children :(,0
sue i could have written your post my mother suffered from severe manic depression she was delusional she thought people on the radio were listening to her and people on tv were watching her she endured many ects and hospital stays she would walk around barefoot during the winter wearing only a thin spring coat while looking for cigarette butts left on the sidewalk it was awful i never had any friends over because i didnt want to have to explain to them why my mother was different than theirs she died at age 54 from cancer my brother was bipolar too he committed suicide in feb 2010 because he couldnt stand being in pain all the time from depression i am bipolar too but fortunately i am not suicidal i struggle with depression sometimes for weeks at a time im 58 and still trying to find the right meds to help alleviate the depression my brothers suicide has really done a number on me,0
this is me to thet i have severe depression ocd ive never been diagnosed with bipolar tho i over think everything and have horrible mood swing,0
lianne this is exactly my problem my moods are so extreme miserable and angry and teary and sulky 5 mins later im overly happy over strange little things that yes shoudl make one happy but i just get like you said - giddy then within 10mins or so im back to moody mi have anxiety/depression meds but am thinking about talking to my doctor about possible bipolar but how d you go about this i feel my dr will think im just overreacting,0
i was the same way i was treated for anxiety and depression but i noticed the meds i was on wasnt really working i tried several different kind then i found out that bipolar runs in my family i talked to my doctor and i am finally on the right meds and i feel like a new person,1
i have citalopram for anxiety/depression i think ill make an appointment on monday because i cant concentrate on anything anymore just when i think i have a handle on it i realise i dont!,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar when i was 17 and im 28 now and what you have described it sounds like me it isnt bipolar it sounds like borderline personality disorder or unstable personality disorder turns out i was wrongly diagnosed at 17 so for 11 years i thought it was bipolar turns out its bpd the difference between the two is bipolar the manic moods and extreme lows happen over weeks months where what i have got happens hours or minutes one minute happy laughing then upset and angry like really angry within a few hours im back happy again hope this has helped,1
i find that i get ridiculously angry over nothing like scary angry! then i can be laughing about the same thing an hour later im constantly tired no matter how much sleep i get ive had suicidal tendencies before not so much now though i hate everything and everyone and i dont have a filter if i have something to say i say it even when i know i shouldnt! i constantly worry about the smallest things yet the bigger things do t bother me as much im obsessed with detail i need to know everything about everything im exhausted from trying to act normal,0
ive been thinking its something more for a while now i struggle to concentrate at work i get so mad,0
copy and pasted from a page hope it helps in regards to bipolar: bipolar is a complex mental health disorder its most common forms are bipolar i (mania and depression) and bipolar ii (hypomania and depression) however other forms do exist due to the cyclic nature of this disorder it is often times difficult to treat and because of society’s stigmatization of the disorder those who are suffering from bipolar often times feel embarrassed or ashamed leading to them not getting the help they need bipolar i is the most common form of bipolar that society talks about it is characterized by a cycle of really high highs and really low lows individuals with this type of bipolar may experience a period of “normal” mood in between mood swings during which their mood and energy level feels “right” and their ability to function is not disturbed during the high periods symptoms can include taking on too many activities at once spending money in ways that cause trouble becoming more talkative outgoing or sexual and consumption or increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs these symptoms may lead to others perceiving the sufferer as strange or annoying and can cause trouble with co-workers or authority figures during the low periods sufferers often feel a lack of energy a need to stay in bed or get extra sleep and little or no motivation to do things they need to do they often put on weight during these periods and feel sad or depressed all the time sometimes during the low phases they may feel helpless or even suicidal their ability to function at work or socially can become impaired (bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale) bipolar ii is characterized by hypomania meaning a slight increase in mood followed by depression hypomanic episodes are defined by feeling incredibly productive and happy sufferers may see themselves as being in a high functioning mode and feel that there is nothing wrong during these periods the depressive episodes are defined by a prolonged period (at least two weeks) of feelings of sadness hopelessness and disinterest in taking part in life during these low phases sufferers often feel fatigued restless agitated unfocused indecisive and in some cases suicidal (bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale) because bipolar involves both highs and lows it can be difficult to treat if someone stays manic their physician will focus on bringing their mood down to a healthier happy this however can be difficult to accomplish as many people who suffer from mania enjoy the extra energy creativity and intensity that comes with it likewise it can be difficult to treat the depression that comes with bipolar because the medications used to treat the depression can unfortunately cause a manic episode it is also not uncommon for bipolar medications to stop working overtime causing an individual who was once stable on medication to cycle and have to start the search for an effective medication over again lastly some of the medications used to treat bipolar are known for causing side effects in some people knowing this keeps some people from trying medications that might actually help them from my 14 years working with an adult psychiatrist and my 9 years as a licensed counselor i can attest to the stigma many individuals suffering from bipolar struggle with society has wrongly blamed bipolar disorder for causing people to commit horrific acts such as assault and murder society has also misused the term in a negative sense to describe people they do not like strange weather mechanical issues with their car etc; the list goes on these derogatory and inaccurate associations keep people from seeking help because they fear being diagnosed with bipolar and then being labeled as “crazy” and “dangerous” by their family and friends when i have a client that has received an official diagnosis of bipolar from a doctor one of the first things i often have to do is work with them to see and accept that society is wrong that they are truly not crazy or dangerous i then have to help them work through their fear of being out casted by everyone in their lives so that they can tell their mom or dad or best friend about their diagnosis and what they are going through overall bipolar can be one of the hardest mental health disorders to suffer from it can present differently from person to person but it always has a component of fluctuating moods the best thing someone suffering from bipolar can do is think about how wrong society is about most things and then remind themselves that society is wrong about bipolar too heather n smith med licensed professional counselor supervisor,1
the depressive state of bipolar 2 can last for days or longer that is dangerous for the person affected because they are definitely at risk for suicide :(,0
bipolar is just horrid x,1
psychosis can manifest in extreme maniatrust me i knowive had a few psychotic episodes where i was extremely paranoid and delusionalhe needs help but he needs to want to get help,1
his paranoia and delusions may get worse and that could be dangerous he really needs to be hospitalized,1
honey thats not bipolar thats paranoid schizophrenia,1
i have bipolar 1 and i had psychosis twice i had to be hospitalized twice i was very paranoid and was thought to be schizophrenic at the first hospital ive been properly medicated for almost a year and a half and havent had any delusions since being hospitalized my parents had to call the cops on me the 2nd time,1
may not be bipolar at all he could have paranoid schizophrenia you may not be able to easily convince him to visit a doctor he may start assuming you are part of the "conspiracy" thats against him and fight against it your sister-in-law may have to try to get him commited to a hospital in order to get him any help if there are moments of lucidity in his thinking/behavior (where hes less ill and more compliant) you may be able to talk him into going to see the doctor however if you do dont wait to do it take him immediately when he is willing to go he may cycle back into psychosis quicker than you expect in case you dont know a person in full-blown psychosis can become violent or dangerous if they feel threatened be careful how you handle him my best wishes are with you,1
i have a friend with schizo-affective disorder + paranoia who has these issues but is open to and grateful for help however their sibling is much more severe and sees everything and everyone as part of a plot obviously help is needed but resorting to trickery or sectioning could prove the beliefs correct please seek advice and support from mental health agencies best wishes x,1
he has paranoia,0
firstly dont assume anything unless you have a diagnosis secondly it looks like you are going to struggle in getting that diagnosis if he is over 18 and is either a threat to himself or others he can be sectioned under the mental health act as an adult he is also able to refuse treatment so unless he is willing to be seen by a health proffesional then he is going to continue to struggle unless you can convince him the his problems can be sorted if he does see someone good luck,0
i feel like worse days are ahead of me especially financially because i rely heavily on my mom for financial support im on disability and im 30 years old now first got disability when i was 19 anyone on disability knows its not enough to live off of i cant handle the stress of working im such a failure when it comes to being an independent adult sorry just need to vent somewhere,0
see i dont deal well neighbors are you an upstairs neighbor? well if you are stomping around really loud upsets them a lot id slam my door extremely hard when they would do it id even put my bass stereo on the floor and play whatever loud music youd like but my advice is prolly not the best i dealt with young party girls moving in an out all the time and i just ended up getting really passive aggressive towards them like they took up all 9 spots we had in the lot for their friends so i just parked my car where they couldnt get out,0
i would also try to reach out to the neighbor and gain their sympathy or  ask the landlord /manager if the door can be muffled or put on one of those hinges that control how fast or slow the door closes so that it closes slower however i have been in similar situations and have seen the supposedly gained sympathy and understanding bear little other fruit its harder but much more effective to reduce your hope of changing other peoples actions and try to decondition yourself as much as you can even if its just a little increasing your tolerance and flexibility will serve you and others the most in the long run i also have a lot of anxiety and have been troubled by loud sudden noises ironically i have an emotional support dog who also hates sudden loud noise especially of the bang variety his barking and my needing to comfort /quiet him have actually helped increase my tolerance of such sounds whatever happens i have faith in your ability to find resolution! the situation cant go on forever best luck,1
i never want to relapse but i often struggle with the hospital or home i pretty much always want to die,0
get upset and frustrated with todays society suffer with major depression suicide is never off my mind but in this day and age there is no compassion conversation feelings or interaction its all about i want want want want selfish people is all i can say sad but true sometimes a hug is nice!!,0
i was hospitalized about seven times this past year with depression anxiety seizures cause i dident take my meds for five days ive been on these since i was 10 but id always taken them at night was takin them in the morning now back too night i was hospitalalized for other stuff too and now six months later im doing good going and doing stuff i feel a lot better:) i have my friends back and a bf who is awesome:),0
this is going to sound fucked up but i love being hospitalized yes i have been put in restraints given shots woken up at 5 in the morning for blood and miserable while in them but they have taught me so much i hate being in hospitals but i hate leaving them they are pure hell but at the same time i never want to leave its the one place where i feel safe where i know i am not going to kill myself because quite frankly i dont want to die i try to kill my self but i dont want to die i have voices in my head who want me to die i am not always in control i am always scared of what i will do to myself and thats why i like them its a safe haven where people understand and dont think your crazy its a place where you can not be afraid and learn how to control the things you wish to yes i do self harm in hospitals but i have people there to help me cope and learn other things to do you learn life skills that you dont find elsewhere i hate them and im terrified of them while i am in but secretly love them at the same time i mean i have spent so long in them they are like a second home i never want to be hospitalized again but if i do something to be needed to go back then i would go back knowing that its for a good reason am i need the help,0
sunshine fresh air music i made a conscious decision to put up with the troughs because i love the peaks (although the beta blockers/diazepam get rid of 90% of the associated anxiety) as long as the ptsd doesnt synch up with the more extreme highs/lows then im pretty safe,0
no this is not normal get your thyroid checked check your diet med check--get you some buspar get that exhausting anxiety in check get some exercise--even just a walk around the block,1
how do you like the adderal i started the smallest dose 2 times a day i only have maybe 2 ideas or chatters in my head at once instead of 50 but just cant start to fix my house so overwhelming,0
funny you should mention that currently im on epilim for ptsd but found its shot my vision however i was trialled on ritalin once by my old psychiatrist but couldnt get my script refilled so far (due to having to change psychiatrists and this one preferring epilim) but when i did try it short term it both fixed my fatigue and apathy massively and slowed down my bpd and ptsd thought processes (including flashbacks) and forced me to be in the moment and mindful; so it definitely helped me massively now its just a struggle as my psychiatrist has advised me ill need to see a private psych on the side to get my benzos and ritalin managed because they arent allowed to (nor comfortable with) prescribing either same goes for my gp,0
especially when you are mentally disturbed,0
i hear the same thing dailyit just makes me worse like why cant i just shake it offwhy am i so weak tired explaining it to ppl now i just say yup thats me a wack job i really dont think ppl can relate unless they experience it i am a horrible person most daysmaybe it is all my fault hope u get some support before you turn cold like me,0
ignore them you are the one living with it took me 10 years to get here i was ashamed i had bp and i tried to hide it from others did me no good look in the mirror and say im beautiful and i have a disease that does not define me than live your life trying to stay in remission,0
i am going through the same thing my partner doesnt believe that depression anxiety and bp "exist" and that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance of the brain cannot argue with the man because he wont budge on his opinion so annoying to deal with,1
i agree with babie i had to threaten my mom with not having a relationship with me if she didnt stop treating me badly for being sick i know that sound mean but what she was doing and saying was mean and i just sat her down one day and firm but respectfully laid it all out on the table the more i kno about being bipolar and the more i look back my mom was too just untreated but if she stopped for my health i would have had to walk away and with your spouse if they cant be supportive than thats not how ya love someone,0
its hard for some people in general to understand those of us suffering from bipolar even when i was committed there where still people in my family who just didnt except the fact i was suffering from a disorder and believed my condition did not exist to them its all in my head and im in a mood or seeking attention ive learned to accept that they are just not ever going to accept the fact that bipolar disorder is something many of us suffer from all i can say i deal with each day as best as i can critics and all because i have a hard enough time just trying to get through the day let alone worry about what people in my family think i truly wish i could have been more use take care,0
it made me forget everything my short term memory was all wacky it was horrible i got off of it quickly good luck,0
it has helped wonders for my bipolar and anxiety however i hate the side effects slowed down feeling burning and pins and needle feeling in feet and constant thirst then i love this medicine though but however it has caused me to lose a lot of weight and ive always been small and my doctor said if i cant stop losing weight hes done blood work to rule out health concerns and they were great but he said im losing to much weight as im already in a size 5 and can wear 4s hes said if it continues ill be mal nutrition and it sucks cause its the only medicine thats worked for my bp,0
i cried all day every day on it  i was a mess it was horrible,0
im on it my dr is hoping it will help me with an added side effect of weight loss/appetite suppressant i definitely eat less i cant say ive lost weight im still just in starting stages of testing it to see if it is a good med for me (dr took me off depakote and replaced it with topomax im now up to 1 1/2 pills 2x for a week and then 2 pills 2x a day starting next week) paired with wellbutrin and adivan for anxiety bipolar2 and clinical depression im beginning to feel a little bit normal again its still early and i still have rough days but its getting better,0
some people are on allot of medicatipn but that is ok!!!! if it is helping dont worry about it!!! i went off all my meds and it was a mistake just remember is not your fault and its ok to take allot of medication everyone is different!! god bless! oh and im back on them now and im grateful i have them,1
the best advice is #1-stay on your meds its when people with our diagnosis start thinking im fine or i hate taking them that they get into trouble #2-stop feeling ashamed or thinking it is sad yes it sucks yes it is a struggle every single day dont let it define you who cares what people think? in fact i am very open about it your journey can help so many people!! ,0
i suffer from very bad anxiety and i am on xannax and clonazepam i do not tell people either except my parents and husband what meds i am on you should not be scared or discouraged because you are getting the help that you need! tons of people just self medicate and dont want to get the help so you are going in the right direction by seeing someone and taking meds this forum is great and everyone on here should understand good luck and stay strong :),1
my mum does the same and im waiting for that phone call that tells me shes gone please seek out a professional you can trust; be honest & open about all this the comfort you get now isnt worth the risk you matter youre stronger than you believe at the mo you are strong! your prescribed meds are enough so please think twice about playing russian roulette with otc meds however you feel there must be somewhere to turn for support wishing you all the best ill be thinking of you (( <3 )),0
i take 900mg 3 times a day for severe anxiety,1
i take it 3 times a day myself for generalized anxiety disorder :(,1
dean behnke gabapentin is normally used for diabetic neuropathy they find it to be an effective and safe treatment for anxiety,1
i take 1200 mg twice daily for severe anxiety i have not had to use an anti-anxiety med in years!,1
the struggle is that real!,0
wow me again sometimes ive told people whats going on with me then they either just walk away and not talk or just shake their head and laugh so i stopped talking about it,0
are you mobile practise good self-care (washing cooking eating) as laura said they ask you to spell a word repeat a sequence do a simple sum etc also how does your issue impede daily life and they observe your speech (fluent or too fast/slow/confused and if you look well kempt ie clean and tidy my default setting even if ive not washed or dressed for three weeks is to look presentable and greet them with a plastic friendly smile and speak clearly i was told afterwards that all went against methey look for signs of anxiety v confidence via speech and body language do you need help to do any daily tasks good luck mine taken away in feb waiting for result in october x,1
ps ive had severe anxiety depression sociophobia and very severe insomnia for several years (reason private) having a lot of professionals involved in my case a wonderful support worker amazing support from one special friend who shopped cooked and cleaned for me as well as 4 surgeries 18 months ago and was almost successful with a suicide attempt about 6 weeks ago heigh-ho :/,1
this isnt a prescription med but this seriously helps me!!! a company called m network makes mstiks and there is one called soul and what it does is calms you down puts your mind to ease allowing the never ending thought of worry to die down if you drink it a hour before you want to sleel it will actually help you sleep its all natural you put it in water it tasts amazing if youd like a sample you can pm me,1
i take klonopin 1mg during the day and 1mg at night  im also on seroquel xr for bipolar 2 now the seroquel xr is nothing like reg seroquel its a godsend and my anxiety has calmed down significant klonopin is longer lasting than xanax and doesnt hit you as hard  hope this helps,1
i have anxiety disorder and i take propanolol 80 mgvalium 4 xa day still have bad days tho good luck with gp ,1
you were doing well with your anxiety because of your meds why go off them,1
my daughter suffers from bpd and anxiety disorder which causes severe tourette symptoms in all the years and baskets of meds the only thing that has made a huge difference is cannabis oil its truly miraculous ps its now legal in my country even though started giving it to her long before,1
i have bipolar 2 and general anxiety disorder my dr gave me xanor sr slow release 2mg a day it keeps me stable throughout the day seraquel 100mg at night for sleep xanor has kept me sane no generic for it though,0
gabapentin worked miracles for me for me it was like a benzo propranolol also worked for the anxiety in my body,1
buspirone works awesomely for me i take it 3x a day i especially take it before i go to bed so i dont wake up hyperventilating cuz im having an anxiety attack,1
im on busiprone 60mg and do pretty good but it still shoots up suddenly but this med has helped me more than any other wow dont ever go off your meds even on meds youre gonna have anxiety so i just learn to live with it but the physical symptoms of it are hard to deal with the hunger the foot in your gutstuff like that good luck,0
i take xanax 3mgxr and i drink celestial seasonings chamomile tea during the day to ease my anxiety i was shocked at calming effects of the tea although as a warning it does make me a bit drowsy at times,1
i hate bad grammar as much as i hate medications for free-floating anxiety (gad),1
same for me works great i really like it only anxiety/panic medicine thats ever worked for me,1
i inherited generalized anxiety disorder (gene slc6a4) & yoga home practice relieves it as it does my bpd and bipolar disorder ii my non-fiction writing & poetry as well as artwork help i am never idle,1
this is my post my name is julie i failed to mention i also have bipolar disorder ll borderline personality disorder and social anxiety disorder,1
if you cant get a script right away try cbd oil marijuana it will calm your anxiety i too have bipolar disorder 1 borderline anxiety it helps with the rougher spots i take a mixture of medication for my bipolar and my anxiety many drs today are trying to stay away from narcotics because of abuse you may have to try a mixture of meds before you find the right cocktail that will work for you good luck god bless! and support groups are great if you have them available!,1
hi julie i have bipolar ll and anxiety i am currently on 450mgs effexor in the morning and 10mgs olanzapine (zyprexor) at night after years of different medications olanzapine has been the best one for my anxiety good luck,1
im bipolar with depression and anxiety i take klonapin (sp) it works really well it isnt as strong as xanax but it does its job unfortunately my dr doesnt like using it long term so i am working with her on finding something else that will work i also suffer from anxiety related insomnia and it helps me relax and sleep,1
i have bipolar anxiety bpd and agoraphobia i take the least amount of meds as i can now because when i was younger o was way over medicated and was like a zombie basically i take wellbutrin for my depression and xanax for anxiety the xanax is not working very well now because i have a tolerance for it but it did help a lot on the beginning,1
i have depression anxiety and im bipolar i currently take xanax up to 3 timea a day and trokendi twice a day currently its working and ive been taking these mix for over a year,1
julie ann bergen i have bipolar 1 ptsd i been doing unbelievable well on: risperdal minipress (similar to propanolol blood pressure med but works on anxiety/flashbacks) and lamictal (mood stabilizer) i used to wake up in severe panic attacks each morning and would have severe prolonged manic episodes a few weeks into these meds and the anxiety and mania are gone  good luck it may also be helpful to you to look into joining dbsa (depression bipolar society alliance) and attending meetings,1
i have tried every med for anxiety,1
i started the propranolol for migraine prevention and two weeks later realized that all anxiety was gone! i love this med!,1
i have rapid cycling bipolar 1 with anxiety im on 400 mg oxcarbamazapine as my mood stabilizer and then seroquel 300 mg is my antipsychotic and then propranolol 80 mg is my anxiety med and migraine prevention med,1
husband is on propranolol im on gabapentin 3/day and clonazepam clonazepam knocks me out so i can only use it at bedtime since i was waking up with horrible panic/anxiety attacks (and im not any longer) it obviously worked for that,1
i take klonopin and my old daughter does as needed for anxiety and ptsd my 14 year old takes a low dose of vistaril for same issues,1
xanax is best for me as i have anxiety and panic attacks i need something fast acting i dont experience general anxiety all day it usually comes and goes i drive work craft cook etc etc with no problem ive been off it for wks and no withdrawals but everyone is different mindfulness can help with anxious thoughts good luck hope you find the best med for you,1
my first thought is get to your dr asapand let them know what you are feelingit has been reported that infusions of ketamine will eliminate suicidal thoughts for up to a weekdont know if that will work for you but i would askyour obsession is sort of like a seisurenot likely to get better on its ownwont pretend to know what you are going throughbut some ssris can cause these thoughts (known in people under 20 yrs old)might ask to switch to another ssrimy symptom is fear not suicide,0
my parents are still in denial my mom understands something is wrong but not exactly what it is and my dad just tells me "its all in my head" i mean duh it is lol but he doesnt mean it like that i was diagnosed with depression at 15 bipolar and bpd at 23 im 30 now and they are still telling me this haha it frustrates me and makes me kind of upset when people dont understand or make an effort to understand but still feel the need to put their 2 cents in  im not religious so when people give me that i get even more upset,0
i would probably explain to them that bipolar disorder is the same as having cancer you cant just make it go away if they wont accept that i would probably unfriend because who needs that crap (i say this as a person with both bipolar and with cancer the bipolar scares me more they cut the cancer out),1
my mom says shit like that to me i tend to shake my head smile say i know and then either walk away or make a joke about how god needs to stop testing me its hard to deal with people like that they just dont understand,0
i stopped caring about peoples comments they are ignorant and i have too much im dealing with to entertain them i just dont mention it to those kind of people anymore my life is less stressful and i am at piece with my bipolar at she point i tried explaining that its the same as having diabetes u dont ask for it it has no cure but can be maintained,0
ive had many people doubt i am bipolar some doubt bipolar is really even a thing i know the truth and have to be satisfied with that it hurts i share posts on mental illness in the hopes they can better understand its a struggle,0
to deny who you are is to deny the one that made you if i where to be told something like this - thats what i would say and then i tell them that their comment while probably and in all honesty well meant made me feel like i should be ashamed of who i am i should feel bad for how i think i should feel guilty for accepting that i have an illness i should lie to myself fight myself tear myself apart because i cant be who i am then i would explain that by doing all those things - i would lose any ground i had gained to recover cope and learn how to "be",0
bipolar is not a "title" to be ashamed of it is just a way to describe brain functioning religion also has nothing to do with bipolar either (and i am a christian) children of god can have all different forms of brain functioning whether it be bipolar schizophrenia asd did bpd "typical" etc accepting bipolar or any other mental health concern as a part of the self still makes one a child of god and then after saying that i would include some helpful article links to help educate her and others on the truth about bipolar,1
it would piss me straight off growing up whenever i attempted to talk to my folks about my depression and anxiety i was met with "you just need to work on your relationship with the lord and things will work out" every single time mental health conditions and religion are two separate things so many christians in this country cant see anything without trying to out a jezeus stamp on it grrrrrr,1
id want them to validate me in that yes i struggle with bipolar disorder that is not all that i am it is not my identity it is part of it completely wanting to squash it is very ignorant in my opinion and they (and countless others around the world) need to end the stigma ps i have such issues finishing projects and lose interest after a short or long burst of intense making (knitting in my case) buy tons of yarn then get too apathetic and depressed to knit so i feel you also i am polish too which i thought was great that you mentioned for the chuckle and for the way that it is a part of you just like bp and should be treated as such hope that helps,0
i think they call it a label b/c they are uncomfortable with it - ur notits stigmatizing & they dont even know it,0
hi i would have done what briana suggested i know from my illness i get really upset at whats happened to you and so please dont let it get on top of you sweep i t aside and move on i have ptsd and people has said that im okay i do watercolours! ggrr its so annoying how upsetting people can be with their big gobs!!,0
the same way you did because i feel the same way and do the same thingsalthough i was never allowed to have friends in my previous marriage making new ones is harder for me because im afraid i wont be accepted with my problem,0
it dosent matter what ppl say but if u have a mental illness your not going to believe positive things i would know im struggling with three mental illnesses so i know the struggle is real hope this makes sense,0
i honest would get upset cuz i would feel like there downplaying my issues and not taking it serious and acting like my mental health is a bad thing,0
when someone says something like that it makes me feel like i embarrass them im just trying to get a grip on it and accept it myself please dont make me feel worse and question myself even more,0
when i was first diagnosed as bipolar my mom kept saying that i wasnt she didnt believe the dr but in the same breath eod say that she thought that the (bipolar) meds were helping i think that there is so much stigma on mental health issues that still clouds the truth today i used to explain my depression before the bipolar like cancer i can treat it and it can go into remission but its never really gone and i didnt do anything wrong to get it its a sickness just like getting cancer it can be hereditary things can happen in life that can make you more vulnerable to it but you cant speak it into or out of existence,0
bp depression will make you feel this way im on an up swing and im terrified at the down swing,0
my daughter was just on it she is 17 with bpd anxiety depression and adhd this med aggravated the depression and made it worseso she went back on ritalin,1
made my anxiety worse tbh,1
wow effexor is fantastic for bipolar and depression zero side effects when first taking it but dont forget to take it you will get little head zaps and dizzy spells im currently going through it as i type this message not that i forgot to take it i just dont have the money until tomorrow to fill my script its horrible ,1
i messed up my first script on a small dose and took 2 a day instead of 1 and was left with 3 days with no pills thought i was dying of the flu horrible withdrawal my doc doesnt want to give me anything else for my anxiety and bpd at the moment so im hoping this helps,0
there should be a crisis intervention service in your area you will find one or if its too overwhelming pm me x,1
sharing this bc this fits it perfect its my exact struggle everyday,0
yes unless you suffer from depression and anxiety issues you will never understand how hard it is to live day by day and keep going like everything is normal,0
this is true for men as well except i dont wear mascara have struggled for over 45 years now and care for my partner who is bipolar,1
its a hole that seems to get deeper each day you fear experiencing happiness even for just a moment because it wont last or something bad will happen nothing good ever lasts,0
its a very deep dark hole that i so desperately want to get out of to see the sunlight but cant reach the top and no ppl that dont have it dont understand even if they try,0
very true been there done that not proud of it either ashamed thanks to meds im on now the mutilation part is over just cant stabilize the depression,1
sooo true its horrible & people dont understand wen u just want to stay home & sometimes just be on ur own cos u feel like shit,0
to be ill is to be holistically affected in both neurons or nervous tissue and somatic tissue as the brain influences not only itself but the holistic physique the head including the whole self sure neurons and somatic cells differ from one another but the neurons are in control over the somatic cells the forebrain first begins to appear together with the heart in the human embryo at three weeks both brain and heart are connected by the vagus nerve,1
truebut we cant feel others peoples pain or do anything about itso maybe selfishly its about me and i shouldnt feel guilty,0
this is exactly the double standard that is forced upon those with mental illness sure someone may have it worse however if the people who are "normal" would stop imposing their views on the mentally ill there would be more understanding for the mental illness and no criticism or its companion guilt,0
the worst is when youre the one telling yourself others have it worse so you dont worry about yourself,0
these things youre going through and thinking of are heavy burdens my biggest concern is your self medicating and self harm thats a deadly combination please please be honest with your dr and flat out tell them when you can but first you really should go to the hospital and get care please they can monitor you get you on meds that take away the thoughts and actions of self harm and that would be one less thing on your already overloaded plate ive been there with both self medicating and self harm suicidal thoughtsect the hospital will have resources to give you for support groups for all of your issues take baby steps and yes break it down to one day at a time i even break it down to one minute at a time sometimes dont be afraid to reach out like youre doing now it takes balls to do what youre doing!! youre on the right path!! baby steps reach out to all of us here dont be afraid to pray and ask our heavenly father for help he wants and expects to hear from you he loves you!! he will help you but be proud of yourself for taking this first step!! and remember if the dr you have isnt working with you or for you find a new one it took me several before i finally found one i could be truly honest with i wish you the best my friend!! god bless!!,0
that was a devastating thing to have happen to you there are no words its a tragic thing to happen to a child of course it changes the child for ever please dont let what happened define who you are now you can let it go and move forward with your life make peace with the past and write your future make it whatever you want it to be find out who you are away from the pain you can do anything find what makes you happy dont worry about your sexuality it doesnt matter one day when you get yourself together you will meet someone to love and who will love you back girl or boy it doesnt matter,0
hey mee to i told my mom and she to this day doesnt believe it i also question me and also its affected my relationships i have kids but when im with them i stress in a way that it distracts me but hey i would like to be your friend,0
i feel for you so much i know exactly what you are going through i have alot of things from my past that has completely messed my head up good but this past year has pushed me to my breaking point its been especially hard i wont bore you with my life story or the details and im ashamed to admit ive resorted back to alot of my old bad habits just to try and get thru another day i cant tell you how to fix it but i sure hope things get better its not fair to feel this low its not your fault i know that i dont know you but i can def relate and i hope the very best for you i truly do i hope you find true happiness and it stays with you forever idk why but your post really stuck out to me maybe because im feeling the same and i know how i hurt and i dont want to think of someone hurting this bad sending love ❤❤❤,0
before you get a girlfriend you have to get your head together i also was sexually abused by men youre rightit affects every relationship however help is out there self-harm and self-medicating will not do you an ounce of good in the long run if you want a girlfriend and maybe children you have to stop letting the abuse control you master it like you would master playing the piano it is scary at firstbut with professional help it is doable build a support system around yourself and a close relationship with your therapist choose a best friend someone you can confide in use these tools to rise above the abuse it is time to lance the boil and get the poison out! i believe in you believe in yourself!,1
malena valentin youre right however then youre confused not actually gay food for thought ~dani,0
not always born gay many times when a child is sexually abused he/ she may be confused due to the abuse,0
look after urself sleep well stay away from stress do things u enjoy/ check side effects of ur meds maybe there alternative or you cud do better without certain meds if one giving you lots of probs or switch to another,1
i am also bipolar with anxiety and adhd thrown in i actually recently had a nervous breakdown and the thing that got me through was my journal and music i reached out and realized i had very little support which really hurt i also have a therapist that helps me so much and meds of course but i am so sorry you are going through this you are not alone! and when youre feeling really low and want to bash yourself try so hard to realize that you are important and worthy be kind to yourself i struggle with that myself but you will get through this!,0
one day at a time and try to stay away from your triggers and if that dont work you could face your fears and see if that works for you,1
i could have written this post my family has no concept of what bipolar is all they do is yell at me my anxiety can get so bad that i lose it and can get nasty my meds dont work ive been on countless useless medications i only see my psychiatrist about once every two to three months not good i called him yesterday to change my anxiety meds so far i havent heard back from him i will give him a couple of more hours if he doesnt call back i will call him again i will turn myself into a pain in the ass if i have to i really dont care anymore my brother committed suicide because he could not stand the pain from depression anymore thankfully i am not suicidal i just want to be given meds that actually work im afraid to go to sleep at night because i know the anxiety i will wake up with oh yeah i am raising my 13 year old grandson its very difficult im sorry for rambling thanks for listening,1
on the bright side the anxiety and depression are probably symptoms of the bipolar so you actually only have one problem not three :) if you have bp1 then that might account for the psychosis too  in which case you are 1 for 4  a good result treat the bp and most of the other stuff is manageable,1
i want you to know that you are not alone i too suffer from these disorders along with panic ptsd agorophobia fear of ppl and insomnia many different meds though the years all i can suggest is therapy if youre not already going very important dont give up on meds there are sooo many out there unfortunately it takes time and the right combination keep trying if they dont work make the dr try something else also very important is if your dr doesnt work for and with you get another ive learned the hard way try to eat regularly (easier said then done) but force yourself if you have to get 6-8 hours of sleep if you can when and if i do sleep i seem to handle all the muck better and we all know exercise helps though very hard to do when you feel like you do at least for me i dont know if youre spiritual but i do alot of praying i pray for the drs to find the right combo of meds i pray for healing i cry out to our heavenly father and spill my guts he lightens the load theres a verse in the bible among so many others that i pray over and over again i can do all things through christ who strengthens me pick up the bible say a prayer for something in it to comfort you please dont feel alone if certain ppl dont understand dont share with them cry out to you dr and find ppl that are there im here ill listen reach out to ppl if you can i learned that the hard way too i dont know of any off the top of my head but ask your dr if they know of any support groups i hope at least one thing here helps you get as many suggestions as you can and pick and choose what works for you you are in my thoughts and prayers!! god bless you!!,0
im over sensitive and was diagnosed with depression i stay awake most nights thinking about all sorts of things that make me cry im a marijuana advocate for the exact reason meds never worked for me and the only thing that ever did was that without the bad side effects like of other pharmaceuticals my family would never support although it does really work i wouldnt suggest seeing a therapist because theyre all just strangers and ive always became extra anxious and paranoid when i got out because i would think i said something bad or off but someone close to you to confine in like a best friend that wouldnt hold anything against you i just recently came out with my problems to a few of mine and it does seem to help a littleat least know youre not alone ,0
spend outdoor activities with your close friends that boost your self esteem and dont overthink about anything because it can cause anxiety and depression  just think positive always and take your meds,1
i have psychosis as well i have a bipolar component to my illness as well i know exactly what it is to have to try to function with those things in and around you all i know is thatwhen you get the right meds with the right doctor/np as i have your functioning goes up it can be crippling and people dont care of course they will tell you to snap out of it it is because you are the uncomfortable truth that they would rather ignore and sweep under the carpet,1
i would suggest seeing a therapist and a psychiatristi have intense depression and anxiety and bpd and autism and a few other things i feel like im all alone too  i just started with a new therapist cuz i moved to a new living environment in may or april and i just got a therapist in august  just two weeks ago  i have maybe two friends who understand my struggles but my parents dont get it at all they say its acting out or attention seeking  they tell me theres nothing wrong and i should not feel that way  some of my family say why cant i just be happy and they want a happy sister  they say dont sweat the small stuff  and its no big deal  they say im exaggerating they never have understood it  they thinks its bs  my family wants me to snap out of it to  im not on meds which makes it almost impossible to cope and livei feel like im definitely bout to lose it and go off the deep end i think i already have,0
my story is similar to this i have severe anxiety that often times it cripples me my family is like just breathe yeah well its not that easy i suffer from major depression too and spend a lot of time in bed its the only place i feel safe,0
m8 its so hard when u suffer from mental illness iam in my 30 and still struggle day to day to keep it together,0
hi ive been where you are right now when people dont understand they are afraid of all the stupid stigmas about us there are support groups they are really helpful and some communities have casual drop in places and you will see that others there are great people,0
youve just said it in one sentencewrite keep writing an learning bout how to manage what your goin through i have all of the above an a 9 yr old son with autism i write poetry to raise awareness for mental health an for my son an all it is my life on day to day basis made into poems great for anxiety also ive just started to do 2 min meditation of mornin that helps me stay calm in situations i usually cant handle hope things get better for you ,0
i noticed after journaling that food effects my moods carbs but esp sugars give me severe mood swings and make me very irritable and blah i do clean eating w daily (least 5 days a week in gym) its amazing what a difference i feel! of course there are still bad days but overall im very stable its just very hard to stay disciplined and without consistantly and not eat dessert butits been working for going on 2 years now,0
the bipolar disorder survival guide by david j miklos it phd and mind and emotions by matthew mckay phd patrick fanning and patricia zurich on a psychological have helped me along with what you mentioned i also have severe adhd ptsd and panic attacks fetzima has also helped a lot as well i have racing thoughts,1
as far as keeping your ducks in a row you need to keep a notebook write down info about meds moods etc whatever is relevant to you itll help a lot and for support id suggest joining a few bipolar support groups on facebook its amazingly helpful to have a group of people who understand your struggles best wishes to you xxx,1
and hv u felt a lot better since on new mess ive struggled and was first diagnosed at 14 with manic depression but wouldnt take any medication and as got older having ft chiyoung it was tough and through a baby equipment loan service got close to a worker there who introduced me to start of her other career in teaching all ability classs which i went to to support her and within 2 or 3 years by age of 2yrs went to college with no schooling previous and got my first destinctionsto go on further and was teaching classs first class was else i know leisure pool never forget it full class but real women from all walks who supported me for many years i realised fitness was soon to be a form of good medication not that it didnt stop the highs and lows because it didnt but found when i felt anxious or starting to feel hyper mainly through days and as u know day gos on and that elevated mood waking up feeling like u could take on the world and boone wud stop from sometimes achieving a lot more then was actually possible and not saying that if work hard anything is possible but from suffering with bi-polar personality disorder postromatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder im coming from a women as in suffering mental health and when in that elevated state can let myself get carried away in ambitions to the point i think and thought i might be gifted in a spiritual way but wont get into that bit lolbeen through many traumas from a child growing up to rite now at 48years old to something happening 10years agomonth afta last and my world was turned upside down i started to take medication as cud read do my normal routine which is something i needed to being able to function bringing up three kids on my own from my daughter being a year and half and her 2 big brothers to building a home working hard sometimes 50hours a week paying childminders aftanoon school clubs morning clubs and so on as i cud the break that routine as new if did i would get confused agitated up and down and left my ex partner because i started being violent with him which obviously ended up both ways and new myself it would cause damage they had seen to much so decided only way forward was to split and bring my kids up using my career as a fitness instructor and aerobics instructor to feed my bring rather then those mess to finally moving 6 years bk i cant get in detail but new if didnt leave i was starting to sink my daughter was going through to much trauma to deal with what was happening to eventually giving in and said id take the medication any thing from mood stabilisers tablets for bi-polar tablets for low mood no elevation tablets to sedate me on nites to anti psychotics all changed many times over the years and still feel they dont work then recently diagnosed with heroism and also loosing my hair to wear u can see my scalp showing through and lost most at front rest just thin strands the facial hair has got so bad i now shave every day and hv tried wax treatments my daughter has bought me nono systems to xmas gonepaying £500 for a ill machine which has no effect waiting for consultant to finally treat me aftanoon bk and forth for year and half now

hospital visits il get taxi there and bk i also hv lateral patella osteo arthritis in both knees and been at stage 4 now for 3 years some days i cant walk as effects ankles feet and now hips and instead of feeling like a normal 48year old women i feel 88years old no offence to our elders as no many and fit but have ever been out with friends to a pub club ora spa for over2 years now and most

because of mental illness hv retracted bk to a person im unsure who i know as me any more i still get up with good thoughts but as the day godson by nite time i just want the dark so can go to sleep again and hope i wake up feeling better its hard excepting all theses changes to myself but theyve happened but feel still now all different mess for me dont make a difference apart from when missed regularmornibg tablets and the withdrawal i getafta being late within couple of hours to wear i cant talk proply or how cant walk down stairs proply not just because of knees but just forget how to or the way to step as in a foot step finding the right medication is always a good thing but for some it just doesnt work ornate not the way it should since the hertism and my hair my mental health has

you did great celebrate the steps you took even without bpd you would be nervous about the next steps to take to secure a job we always think the worst because we have the illness i try to just worry for the day anything could happen tomorrow you have a better chance of something wonderful happening tomorrow than something bad i will pray for you but you have this,0
positive anxiety positive elation - sometimes they mirror symptoms of bp and make us freak out - but dont be fooled they are *good* they are normal reactions,1
good luck!!! deep breathing try to relax its normal to be nervous! its an uncomfortable feeling but it cant hurt you believe in yourself and do your best i wish you all the best keep us posted!,0

i understand im struggling mentally and im definitely tortured inside,0
i was on geodon for a long time and i did have tremors they werent bad but annoying make sure to tell y our doctor if it is bad there can be damage happening and the tremors can be permanent in some cases i had a very bad time on geodon for other reasons and despite complaining to my psychatrist for almost 2 years he refused to take me off it finally when i got better insurance i went to another doctor who quickly weaned me off (he worried about my side effects and the high dosage i was on but it was a more powerful drug than my symptons called for),1
i take neulactil there only 25 mg but 2 of them with valium seem to help me go to sleep they calm the body down from anxiety & help you sleep better,1
quetiapine its a mood stabilizer and sleeping pill in one shot i take 5mg of diazepam with it in case i get night terrors ask your doc everyone is different but proper sleep is crucial,1
ambien is extremely helpful for me along with tegretol valium 20mg seroquel 200mg and hydroxyzine 20mg i am diagnosed with bipolarmixedsevere and had insomnia for 2yrs+ that really took its toll me up for days little sleep isolated lost dramatic amount of weight etc ropinarole is very effective with restless leg syndrome and i take that am and pm very helpful in settling me down to a more comfortable level abilify is also another sleep med that seems to be very helpful to somebut did not work for me so there are other medications to help you can you get to see your provider on an emergent basis or maybe discuss with your providers nurse who will be your voice? i ended up hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and would not be discharged until my sleep stabilized i was also wrongly diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for years so many factors can be considered when insomnia is uncontrolled my case is extreme and i was a mess but not something i had control over you have to advocate/speak up for yourself i also had my husband with me before being hospitalized to substantiate my condition plus it was a legal intervention because i ended up in an uncontrollable destructive rage scared the hell out of me and my family wishing you the best and hope your provider takes you seriously,1
seraqual made me sleep wish i could take it but they took me off too manny side affects light headed dizzyness and nausea sucked cause i did sleep well now on just abilify if i cant sleep hes gonna give me something and a anxiety med i suffer everyday meds suck unless you find the right ones i hate not being abel to sleep,1
i use busparone for anxiety and it stops the cycling thoughts too taking benzodiazapines like valium xanax etc just sets you up to fail you will continue to need larger and larger doses over time those medications are addictive most psychs where i live wont prescribe them any more busparone has been a wonder drug for me i take 15mg twice a day at night i also take seroquel for sleep also but if i dont go to sleep right away for some reason i have visions and lose all of my ability to judge distance and cant walk around or ill fall it helps me pretty fast though,1
i learned the same in the hospital it breaks the anxiety cycle but you really must actually do it and it will also help your concentration,1
same its a miserable existence,0
tired + wired = miserable !! ive had insomnia for over 6 months nownothing has helped and ive tried everything you can think ofchanged meds times taking meds 2-3 hrs of sleep in 24body is exhausted but my brain is going a million miles an hour :(,1
i have also struggled with depression dated a shrink gone to shrinks taken thier meds  played thier game nothing worked until i began to see the huge conspiracy that was causing my depression i have overcome depression with no help from the pros  but from my own critical analysis of what is going on along with honest feedback i am willing to tell more if you like,1
yea my son think about it all the time he would be better off died i just pray everything will be ok hes going through depression and anxiety really bad since my grandmother pass in 2015,1
go to the emergency never be afraid or ashamed to do it ever please we have all been there,0
i have been close back in may in fact due to my sisters arguing while my father was battling cancer i even wound up in the psych ward for a week i like to call it "the looney tunes bin" since then my father has passed away due to this terrible disease i havent been as close though even though my sisters are still fighting and have decided to put me in the middle i hate playing "dawn in the middle" one thing that anyone struggling with these tempting thoughts should keep in mind is the definition of suicide its really just a permanent solution to a temporary problem lately when i get these types of thoughts these steps help 1) stuffed animal 2) crawl under a warm blanket 3) cry,0
well first let me say im so sorry your feeling so badly  and also i can definitely relate  story of my life  u totally took the words out of my mouth  going thru the exsact same things you are not alone i understand  i struggle daily with lack of self love and respect  im always suicidal and i want to end it all  i have very few friends too  ive lost many friends to  im always feeling so alone and lonely  omg  i definitely think the world would be better off with out me and i always say it im currently not working either just volunteeringjust social security so i just wanted to say everything your going they makes sense to me and im here if u want to talk  there are ppl who care and will take u serious,0
hi there i am so sorry that things are crappy right now please go to emergency at the hospital be very clear as to how you are feeling and no sugar coating it it is so scary but you have all of us here so hospital now sweetie and you will be safe,0
hang in there i struggle too am todaybut i know if i wait it will lift and i will feel better again you arent alone! and youre cared about more than you know i know i speak for many of us when i say if you need to talk we will be here you can always email me at if you dont want to message me on fb you can be as anonymous as you wish please dont go it alone,0
right now prayer n self love honey hope this helps god bless you i know the struggle of tthe same all to well life would miss you regardless all the love,0
honestly talk to your counselor if you dont have one get one there are low income clinics that go on a sliding scale when i was going it was completely free because i have literally no income otherwise look into ways to change your thought process when my thoughts turn dark like that (which is often) i yell in my head stop and picture a giant stop sign i then go and do something physical either coloring working with plants or working with the dogs if these things are not helping i will ask my personal service dog to come and task help me avoid caffeine if you can it can actually make anxiety and paranoid thoughts worse take a warm/hot shower do grounding techniques you can google this and go to images and find lists of things to do heres a cute picture of my girl to hopefully make you smile a bit if you need to talk my inbox is always open im not very good at carrying a conversation but i will always be willing to let you vent about things bothering you,0
laurie hollister thank you! since i lost my therapy ive had to find ways to cope on my own i know how it is to struggle with suicidal thoughts and i know the deep need to get help and want to just be ok if my advice can help then im happy,0
that depends on your individual disability for me she helps with my c-ptsd depression and bipolar i trained her to help by watching my back so no one can spook me she alerts and responds to my raising anxiety interrupts depressive episodes and responds to rising manic episodes,1
distraction!!!!! when i get like this i am my own worst enemy what i find best is to take myself out of my head until the phase passes last christmas i was the same way - i was done sounds stupid but i coloured every time the thoughts overwhelmed me the distraction allowed me time out of my own head until the adjustment in meds kicked in please know that the world is not better off without you xxx,1
be prepared for the weird looks and the "im not looking for anything serious" excuses but you have to tell them asap otherwise they might break you out of ignorance spite or scorn they might also make you feel guilty you dont want any of that you need someone who understands or with an open-mind to accept to understand your situation these are very rare as for me i timed the people who stay 4 weeks and then they disappear completely,0
i would live in the moment especially as you are well enough to date at the moment if you experience any symptoms during your courtship live in the moment then and talk about it if you feel you are having an episode and if you are unwell remove yourself from each other until your feeling better thats me you cannot predict the future and you need to get to know each other first dont scare them off we all have periods of normality and who knows if your happy it may not be an issue sometimes self disclosure is better kept to a minimum all the best ,0
i always tell people that is interested in being friends with me or romantically envolved with me at the beginning so they will understand the reason for my actions or me needing my personal space when one doesnt know its always quick to judge that theyre insane and youll be surprise on how many suffers the same thing but to embarrass to talk about it until the other talks about it first,0
you have to be honest otherwise keeping it in will only make you worse by worrying about it,1
ive never really "dated" so i dont know how that works ive never been in a relationship with someone who wasnt a friend first even if there had always been a romantic intent from the beginning (by my own choosing i feel more confident in a person if i know them as a friend) therefore my previous partners all knew about my mental health issues a long time before they stepped into a romantic relationship with me what you need to be prepared for is that sometimes even the most well intentioned people will not understand the truth of how these issues will effect both of you and your relationship you can give full and honest disclosure yet the rose coloured blur of new love will sometimes cloud a new partners judgement making them think that "love conquers all" and then when the dark and honest truth unveils itself it comes as a shock or a nasty scare dont blame yourself for that allow both you and your partner everything you need to learn how to deal with it together and how to look after yourselves through the ups and downs x,0
i agree none of their bussiness till after a few dates and you feel you can trust them not to take advantage of you till then if you feel the funk coming on and they want to see you just avoid it i have experianced when someone knows right off the bat it has not turned out well been taken advantage of played games with my head like i had to question my actions run for the hills and the guys i waited to tell have said i never notice the nice ones i would say really i am bat shit crazy the whole time i would be with them i would fight the head chatters and seroquel i could not take or i would take a nap but now i just figure its to much a pain i attract toxic people so if some nice man comes my way great if not o well,0
i suffered for 20 nearly anxiety depression panic disorder and agoraphobia i dont go out i hide from the world,1
eric was never ashamed of not pretending(just kiddin),0
well i do have a mental illness and its called depression and anxiety disorder bipolar disorder and panic attacks i call myself one hot mess because thats what i am im a mess i struggle daily with this i stay away from people because i dont want them to see my pain or what i have to go through they wouldnt understand it and i cant explain it to make them understand so i hide from the world in silence i dont have a life,0
feel like dog shit today irritable fed up sick & tired but still went to work stayed all day went grocery shopping now football practice for the teen gonna make myself walk during his practice started a scuttle with the spouse earlier today now getting silence just want to hide in bed could use prayers thanks,0
ive been fantasizing this the past few days feeling a lot of anxiety these days too fight or flight?,0
i think thats what is unclear and giving me anxiety what am i working and living for? im just starting to build my life after years of spiraling down neglecting myself just started working again after taking a couple years off to get healthy dealing with anxiety and depression coming up as i take on more responsibility especially today i guess i need to do what we all need to do sometimes take some deep breaths be kind and patient with myself and trust in the process of transition i dont know exactly what i want to do with my life but ill find out while i do what i have to do,1
im bipolar bpd and schizoaffective smoke weed daily best anti anxiety mood stabilizer out there,1
try one step at a time prioritize dont get to overwhelmed,0
do you take meds? and yes certian people take all my energy i avoid that a all cost but i live a lone so it is easy but i would get anxiety and depression the longer i had to be around them so like groups drain my energy to ask you doctor or therapist about help for it if you have to live with them try to build your owen space expain why you need it in a medical mannor,1
i try to structure my days i write a list the night before not a long list because that overwhelm me i always start with a shower of course it doesnt always work out im glad you are trying to address your symptoms before they get worse\,0
im 26 weeks and these 26 weeks have been hell to say the least depression and anxiety are off the charts and i had ppd with my first born wanting to breastfeed with my son who is due in november but not sure how much more of the roller coaster of emotions i can take,1
first off feel free to private message me if you want to talk second ive been off meds now for 3 years i came off of them in 2014 so that i could conceive my first son we knew after my oldest was born that we would want more children and since i was on lithium which is hard to get on and off of we decided just to keep me off of my meds im now almost 36 weeks pregnant with our second child im due in mid-september after my first son was born i had postpartum depression during the pregnancy i did really well until the end when my anxiety got high this time around i havent been doing so great and i wouldnt recommend asking me any questions unless you want my gods honest truth experience i dont lie to people but if you want more information feel free to message me im happy to talk or at the very least if things get rough im happy to be a shoulder because trust me i understand,0
i have bp2 and ptsd i have been on a lot of meds over the years the #1 thing that i have learned is just because something works for someone else it doesnt mean it will for you all our chemical makeup are different and we all metabolize things differently it took a long time for me to find a good balance but i still have periods where i need extra meds when my regulars dont hold quite enough and i spiral down or start getting a bit out of control luckily i have had this disease long enough to be able to recognize the signs usually and to get help before im in troublei have been on topomax for about 15 years now for both migraines and the bp and at a high does have had pretty good control with the bp i only wish it worked as well on the migraines i also take cymbalta for fibro and the migraines if i begin to feel that i am having issues with the bp my doc places me on lithium er 75mg for a short period to help me get through or advert any crisisi also take anti- anxiety meds due to the ptsd i hope this help you some i have been through many doctors and the best thing i can tell you is to stay informed know what meds are out there what there side effects are and what is available to you on your ins if you dont have ins a lot of the pharmacies like wal-marts $4 list have list of medications that are a reduced priceor there are prescription discount cards that will help knock down the price of you script you simply put in the name of the drug in their search engine and it tells you which pharmacy will be cheapest and it gives you a coupon to print for that price if it hadnt been for that program last year med rx my family wouldnt have been able to have gotten half of our meds we needed and it costs nothing to participate good luck to you,1
ive been on lithium for over 20 years and it has made a world of difference i wont change it im also on paxil to help with depression i still have my moods but bit as bad as when i was unmedicated also take adivan for stress and nerves helps with anxiety and panic attacks,1
yes this happened yesterday and my son and i about had a nervous breakdown it would get so loud,0
& for wht reason this happened this way well im not too sure y no worries hey heck it happen my life & cant change a thing just keep amoving and well im going too creat or make of something i hope if not the hell im going too not give in or give ,0
the past is not worth worring about its gone you have no furture if you are living in the past is what got me out of it if you have like a record from your past that always runs in your head write it down you can worry about the future you dont know what it is dont fear it you can write out your plans for the week let it go you can always make goals for the future and write it down i write stuff down cause like you my head was pack with confusing stuff i had no way to change or predict i hope this makes sense sometimes i dont even make sense to myself lol,0
me too ive tried to talk to my docs and therapists but no one realizes just how desperate i am for real sleep without the vivid and chaotic dreams that leave me even more exhausted,0
its not uncommon for medications to stop working as effectively over time your body becomes habituated to the meds and you need something else to help control symptoms you may also be under more stress in your life than you realize right now stress definitely can have an effect on how well your medications work talk to your doctor sounds to me that your anxiety is whats not being controlled as well right now your doctor may be able to give you something else for your anxiety that might work better for you right now anxiety definitely can result in irritability my husband is that wayif he gets anxious he can get irritable and aggressively grumpy please explain to your family and friends that you definitely dont mean it you love them and youre sorry if you hurt them you need your medications adjusted if you explain and apologize they may be willing to let it all go and you may need to find another jobsomething that is a better fit for you personally and that doesnt cause you to feel paralyzing fear my best wishes are with you,1
it is such a destructive illness and everything is so much more complicated in a relationship where bipolar is present i know as i am the partner in one loving a partner with bipolar is difficult the bipolar turns them into somebody that you dont recognize somebody thats not the real person you fell in love with instead of being an equal partner in a relationship you are expected to be a carer when they suffer depression and you have to suffer the emotional abuse often on the other end of the scale bipolar has robbed me of all my trust in my relationship but i am hanging in there perhaps your partner is afraid to face the bipolar situation? afraid that he has lost the person he loves? its lonely being the partner of a sufferer i sometimes feel alone when i am sitting in the same room as my wife escapism to a certain degree is natural who doesnt want to escape the one thing that worries and stresses them out the most? us guys just want to take care of our loved ones and families but when i feel there is nothing i can do i feel worthless and not up to the task a failure that can be destructive mental illness is not fair bipolar is not fair i would recommend returning to counselling and also for both of you to learn more on bipolar together i find going over literature together helps even repetitively as it refreshes what the illness is and what it does i constantly strain to separate the illness from the person good luck,0
i too am bipolar along with schizoeffect anexity and paranoid disorder i am unable to work full time due to the schizoeffect i constantly think someone is watching me or trying to hurt me my support system is my mom brother therapist and psychiatrist i take my meds as prescribed i dont advertise my illness so not too many ppl kno i dont go out often ether but since i live with my family they dont push they ask if i wanna go do something if i say no they dont pressure they ask me if i wanna go somewhere with them no one will ever understand bipolar unless they go through it in my opinion,0
you dont know me but somehow i ended up here ditto to your story i lived a lifetime of struggling and trying to figure out whats wrong with me then someone sent me this and i realized that if one single person would take the time to send me this then im going to survive the mess is them because unless they live it they will never know it were going to be ok for us because we have to be! liliana,0
guilty,0
its a daily struggle for me to contain my bitchiness,0
claire jenkins like how we both reacted to this! so true everyday struggle,0
oh it sure is love just took my kid to the park at almost 8pm to avoid as many as possible ,0
im just very self conscious and very insecure about how i look im a female u know  we have those issues  ive struggled with low self esteem since i was around thirteen maybe even before that  im now 29 society and the media have me feeling so very bad about myself and i honestly have so much self hate i just have a very bad self image and im always comparing myself to the pretty good looking cute girls that i wish i could be but i will never be cuz im just trash,0
lisa ill tell you what i think i think youre very beautiful no bs! you have a great completion and nice features! you have nothing to be ashamed of at all! learn to love yourself! seriously i know its hard because i feel the same way about myself but im working on it and i hope that my perception changes just like i hope it changes with you!!! do you lisa and remember that your heart ❤️ and personality are whats most important!!! i hope this helps!!!,0
bonnie-lee guilty ,0
i struggle with some of those things to  i have bpd and depression anxiety i have very intense worthlessness i feel completely mentally drained  im so close to ending it all  i can relate to a lot of what ur going thru,0
if i may ask what medications are you on? i am on zyprexa prozac and lamictal and do you go to therapy not just a psychiatrist? i have been where youre at and it is horrible feeling the best i know to do is to keep going to therapy and getting my thoughts and my feelings out,0
some people just cant comprehend how bad the depression and anxiety hurts and the judgement that i got from a job was to much for me i am disabled cause of my illness and it is so hard to getn people to understand,0
contrary to what people are saying about him not being the one i can say from experience that its not necessarily true my boyfriend never understood depression or anxiety until i started sharing material with him endless material about others experiences whether they share my disabilities or have something else the mighty has plenty of articles that are well written and relateable if hes willing to read and learn and most of all listen continue to try! we also started couples therapy at 2 years and it has really helped him see how much he relies on me while hes away at work and just how big my heart is how much work i do w his kid and just how hard i struggle every day to get up and get by if theres a system and a way to help him see there is hope however if he isnt willing to try to learn to listen to talk to help and understand then thats when you need to walk away for your own well being,1
im so sorry you are going thru this i have bipolar 2 also and anxiety for ten years and have been married for 13 years my husband will say sometimes i want my debbie back this hurts because ive never stopped being debbie just now i have a battle everyday living with this disease but that is the catch you have it and you have to do what is best for you no matter who does not understand a big part of mental illness is doing what is necessary to help control the symptoms i will pray you find peace for you and your bf put please take care of you first,0
i ache for you its hard because he doesnt understand your desire to stay shuttered in your down time and you cant easily force yourself to go out my wife of 26 years wants nothing more than to sit home and watch movies living life vicariously because of severe social anxiety weve come to a compromise i have recently discovered an interest in theater so thats my outlet and her love of movies and theater gives her the opportunity to get out and come see what im doing,0
so my hubby and i are both bipolar its not easy relationships are hard work that said if your bf isnt supportive or willing to work with you make compromises then you will be miserable but i also want to say being around people who are not bipolar is important in your journey to being independent and well maybe find some books do some research find what works for you finding a distraction from the negatives will help you out of those odd anxious feelings i personally believe that diet sleep exercise hydration and supplements help so much with regulating your body and brain chemistry i found that birth control caffeine sugar and synthetic dyes all affect my mood negatively where ever you are on your journey you can always improve your experience with knowledge and personal trail and error dont let anyone bring you down or put you in an uncomfortable situation just for theyre own sake your worth staying home for,1
id like to say it means he isnt the one i had a relationship like that i felt guilty for wanting to stay home always and didnt want to bore my gf you just gotta find people and friends who take care of those quirks you have regardless of the mental disorder youre a human and have rights to your feelings,0
i agree u dont need all that pulling u down when ur already struggling x,0
he obviously dont care how you feel let alone he will never understand you im sorry you struggle this way and i know just how difficult it can be im sorry for him throwing away someone so special take care be strong and remember youre not alone,0
i think you are reacting to the word imbeciles well if he does not understand the "point" i believe he has little to no understanding of the needs of people diagnosed with mental illness you maybe do not understand the daily myths and stereotypes that i and others deal with everyday because others do not understand the"point" education of society is the overall point but daily to find support can be exceedingly difficult so what is your "point"? words too big maybe stupid idiot or dumb would help you understand because i do not believe you get the "point" either if you do not believe people with a mental illness typically are isolated in society desperately need support from people who have experienced the degradation of these illnesses and can be helpful and insightful,0
i dont know i struggle with it everyday my mom is in my living room in a hospital bed on hospice i know they r slowly killing her with morphine i dont see the point in her suffering y does god do this to people y isnt there a cure for cancer y do the good die young no point in life my mom is 57 her mom died at 49 of lung cancer n now she is facing the same struggle when she goes i want to jump in the hole with her cause really what the hell is the point,0
there is no point when you stop looking for "the point" to everything you learn to enjoy the good time more and let go of the bad when i realized this i stopped feeling so stressed and stopped feeling like a failure no point just wonderful messy life ,0
i would not be stable without it my insurance will not pay for xr but i have had it in the past and that would be my preference i have gained weight but not horribly; you just have to be careful as far as diet is concerned i have other physical issues which makes it hard to exercise just watch the carbs i take 350 mgs at night when i have relapsed i have gone up to 600 mgs for bipolar i disorder thankfully i have not relapsed in a while sleep is a wonderful thing!,1
been on it for over a decade no weight gain but get the munchies at night the xr made me feel like i had restless leg syndrome,0
been on it for about 2 years now works well for my anxiety makes me very tired so i take it at night and let it help me get a good nights rest i do wake up feeling groggy i just give myself more time in the morning than i used to to be up and ready,1
i took it for sleep and it made me horribly unstable running into door jambs cant walk straight unstable your mileage may vary,1
its a great medication here and there side effects and yes i have gained almost 40 pounds myself  it helps with schizophrenia anxiety  helps you sleep kinda for me and helps with depression  etc ive been on it for a year im on 400 mg  also im on other differ types of mental illness meds i am still struggling best of luck to you,1
i also want to breastfeed and i didnt know whether to go back on them or to just go without until i stop i guess i will have to wait and see but i am really scared hey,0
there are some meds that are considered safe while breastfeeding that i tried first (i waited until she was 9 months because i was so worried about it doing more harm than good but i couldnt handle the depression anymore) they took the edge off but werent super effective so once i stopped breastfeeding we went back to meds that had worked in the past it all works out in the end ,1
i stopped my meds when we started trying to get pregnant and stayed off of them until about 9 months pp due to breastfeeding; it was rough to say the least but we all got through it i had/have post partum depression which has made being off meds for bipolar/ptsd/anxiety/depression much worse but we are working to get back on the right meds and im doing a lot better hang in there! once you have your little bundle of joy and start feeling more like yourself it will all be worth it--just take it one day at a time good luck!,1
agreed i took a similar couple of photos awhile back its scary how quickly my mind can shift,1
mentally ill people are stronger than normal people can ever be always remember that sometimes other peoples issues can make you feel that you are wrong but she how you really feel when someone is finally willing to tell you the naked truth i find it just plain cruel for the next person to lie to you while the truth sets us free we can handle the truth better than not knowing not knowing desturbs us and for what its worth i think we are who and what we are because we have the truth inside ourselves as life is supposed to by lived by yet the normal peoples in acceptance of life is far fetched from the truth that we came into being with so dont feel sorry for being honest true consistent caring loving supportive and brave enough to live and love as "mentally ill people" no one deserves us unless they know how to love as we do the right way the only way the real way we are real people the minute everyone accepts that we can all feel free within and do what the likes of bill gates einstein richard brandon and so many others hthat has contributed massively to the advancement of this world can do so accept your delve as an already evolved being and that you are more valuable to this life than many people fear you because they know you can do so much better own it own what you gave these qualities you have that so many aspire to become the irony is that they seek us out to experience only yge laughter and joy that rubbs off on them in our company no more unnessasary apologies for things another persons weakness makes you speak the truth of i love you and you are all magnificent please forgive any spelling errors i was inspired and have overcome and couldnt turn back to edit love you unconditionally,0
there might be other solutions that can help heal us without the harsh modern drugs ,1
ive gone from chronic depression with anxiety to bipolar severe mixed over 28 years my life just seems to get harder and harder hospitalizations legal interventions partial hospitalizations therapy psychiatristsi live the stereotypes and myths of mental illness every single goddamn day and it hurts so badly i have no one left in my life except my loving and accepting sons who keep me going and i love so dearly they are the only positives left everyone else lies to me judges dismisses and wants nothing to do with me i have to fight for everything in my life and i am exhausted and do not trust anyone anymore this is a horrible degrading expensive disease that literally has l ruined me and left me with little hope or happiness im crying now my life is worthless ive never been stable just get worse and worse if people only could feel the hate and indifference that is so intolerable that i want to die,0
try something natural!!! kava root helps with anxiety which is a huge symptom of depression!!! most importantly start praying to god to heal you and never stop praying!!! i am living proof he hears and answers prayers!!! god bless you and i pray you get better soon!!! in the name of jesus christ our lord amen amen amen!!!,1

i lost track of how many sessions i had and yes i definitely have some memory problems on the other hand the results were dramatic and nothing else pulled me out of the abyss i do not feel uncomfortable telling people to look into it,0

horse shit! what you are going through is hell its not preparing you for anything horrible things happen not your fault hell doesnt need an outside motivation it is destructive on its own forces acting against you are not for your benefit not for your future its just painfilled hell but this too shall pass try to hang in there,0
im struggling,0
hesitate?,0
so much that i havent been able to listen to music of any kind because it only reminds me of a sad memory that causes anxiety panic attacks which causes you to go backwards instead of forwards dont wait til it gets worse please!,1
unfortunately i feel like this most days! battling depression is a horrible and very lonely time,0
bipolar sucks i never sleep always feel low and useless then once i am on an up i can be crazy and silly for weeks its the drops in depression i cant cope with ive been in p3 twice and its horrid all they want to do is drug you up instead of listening ,0
call the office and tell them of your situation and how miserable you feel then ask if there are samples that you can take home until your appointment,0
cant help with ur meds but as far as the fact that u stopped drinking well my friend that i can help u with i quit cold turkey and i used pop cycles to get over the drinking it also helped me get over the shakes its not easy to stop drinking but u will be happy that u did i made a promise and am happy that i have kept it for the past 13 years now but i always tell people i am a recovering alcoholic and always will be it would only take one drink to get me going again and i will not do it cause i will lose the one i love the most in this world and i dont want that if u need to talk about this problem friend me will be glad to talk to u,0
theres something seriously wrong with a doctor allowing a patient to run out of medication and give no refills there can be horrible side effects and your depression can get worse i would do what someone else said and go to the er-- they will help you and they may even report your physician take your empty bottle of med with you to show when it was filled and therefore also show when it ran out they will contact your doctor and get some answers and help you,1

i take a couple supplements that are natural that may help these are not in place of the medications your psychiatrist prescribes you these supplements can be purchased from "thorne research" they are not habit forming & you can take them with any medication you may be on my psychiatrist & other drs are aware i take these supplements & are pleased at night i take 3 of the "l-tryptophan" to help me sleep i also add a few capsules of "gaba" as well "gaba" has a calming & relaxing affect "l-tryptophan" is in turkey & naturally aids with sleep im prescribed xanax it is necessary but i try to take it as little as possible since gaba calms & relaxes i try to take gaba in place of xanax when possible especially during the day gaba will relax you but will not make you impaired or fall asleep while driving etc i suffer from social anxiety gaba calms my anxiety without the side effects of benzos xanax is necessary at times yet the less i takethe better oh fyi gaba is also helpful with alcohol & drug withdrawal symptoms i personally take the "pharma gaba 250" they also make gaba 100 most people dont need as much as i take youll have to see what works for you hope this helps good luck to you,1
i am actually glad i weaned off that medication it had horrible side effects for me call your doctor and leave a voicemail if you have to! i remember once i quit taking zoloft and things didnt go well (wouldnt recommend that particular medication) in the meantime see if you can purchase nerve tonic its an over the counter homeopathic medication that helps with your nerves its sold at drug stores,1
im not sure about your dr you should not just stop a med like that please dont hesitate to go to the hospital to get help,1
adaptogenic herbs ive heard can help with withdrawal symptoms ,1
at the risk of suggesting something illegal i tried 3 meds that either made me really sick or crazy so apparently man made meds dont work for me what does work is weed and when im out i have horrible days where i break down for no reason and it gets really out of control but when i smoke it helps me concentrate on a solution to my minor issues during the day,1
im afraid i cant help you with your medication as i am no doctor but i would like to say something instead you should be really proud that you go to work i dont know exactly what condition you have but i think anyone with severe mental health issues that works should be given a medal i also think there should be a government incentive for those who work or get back into work i work full time and sometimes i find it all a bit too much i am actually off work at moment having had an episode good luck hope you get the help you need ,1
to wean you off is one thing but to just stop taking it all of a sudden could be risky,1
my husband goes into a full blown panic attack if he misses a dose!,0
maybe rhodiola rosea i cant believe your doc is allowing you to be off meds i would find a new doc stopping meds is dangerous i agree that mj could help but be sure to get the right strain so your anxiety isnt worse good luck to you,1
i guess i actually told the dr about anxiety and depression thats what she put me on and borderline personality disorder i personally wont rule out bi polar but no diagnosis,1

nobody knows who i really am i never felt this empty before and if i ever need someone to come along whos gonna comfort me and keep me strong? we are all rowing the boat of fate the waves keep on coming and we cant escape but if we ever get lost on our way the waves would guide you through another day far away im breathing as if i were transparent it would seem i was in the dark but i was only blindfolded i give a prayer as i wait for the new day shining vividly up to the edge of that sea nobody knows who i really am maybe they just dont give a damn but if i ever need someone to come along i know you would follow me and keep me strong peoples hearts change and sneak away from them the moon in its new cycle leads the boats again and every time i see your face the ocean heaves up to my heart you make me wanna strain at the oars and soon i can see the shore oh i can see the shore when will i see the shore? i want you to know who i really am i never thought id feel this way towards you and if you ever need someone to come along i will follow you and keep you strong and still the journey continues on quiet days as well the moon in its new cycle shines on the boats again i give a prayer as i wait for the new day shining vividly up to the edge of that sea and every time i see your face the ocean heaves up to my heart you make me wanna strain at the oars and soon i can see the shore we are rowing the boat of fate but the waves keep attacking us but isnt that still a wonderful journey? arent any of them a wonderful journey?,0

i developed a lot of anxiety over the years which is harder to live with than the rest,1
christy seegmiller i feel like you have been where im currently at i finally broke down and went to a psychologist for proper diagnoses after hundreds of questions and an iq test the psychologist told me he thinks my social anxiety brings on add/adhd symptoms ive never heard of that until now he wants to do one more test that puts me in real life situations and see how i react because my alertiveness/attentiveness came back fine on the iq test have you dealt with any of this?,0
you are brave and clearly a fighter i have a son that struggles as well and i understand the struggles keep your head up!,0
not happy u suffer with this but so do i sometimes it is nice to hear someone who struggles with this too just to know u are not alone so many people think this is not real but sadly enough this is very real and extremely hard we will make it,0
i hate what ifs!!!!!just do it do not be scared! be a lion !,0
i tried running from my crappy childhood and avoid things and people that cause me pain you can separate yourself from those who cause you anxiety however you should get help from a psychiatrist or even a mental health worker i really recommend you go to emergency ward,1
it must feel terrible and very overwhelming keep communicating how you are feeling and be kind to yourself if you a struggling seek professional help xxx,0
call police if you have threats on your life they will take care of the people have they been violent with other people,0
thank you all so much for the advice im getting ready to leave now scared nervous dont wanna go i am so nervous theyre gonna try to make mechange everything about myself,0
unfortunately there are some idiot therapists took me years to find the right fit you mustnt give up if you are feeling severe anxiety please go to the emergency ward at the closest hospital tell that you have had suicidal thoughts and feel overwhelmed and unsafe they will admit you even if its overnight usually a psychiatric nurse or doctor will assess you and give you out patient information stay safe hugs,1
everything you are feeling is normal for anxiety/depression sufferers at one time or another! do not feel like you are alone i am also someone that find writing it all down is easier for me to express myself and omg that therapist was a moron i struggle with therapists myself currently im seeing a life counsellor instead when you are feeling a bit better it may help you to help someone elsei find when im helping someone else im not fixating on myself and im able to move forward and it gives me purpose and gives me something to look forward too which is a must! ❤️ good luck for tomorrow at the worst youll get to get things out of your head!,0
your feelings are definately valid good on you for trying again sometimes it takes a few therapists until you find someone you click with it can be difficult and scary to open up but a good therapist will never judge you and they understand its not easy let us know how it goes xxx,0
i totally agree with all of these comments and i am going to be praying too you are not alone; just look at how all of these people care enough to tell you that its going to be okay that dreadful feeling that youre getting is just anxiety and anxiety is just the physical manifestation of stress its a survival thing that our body is supposed to tell us when we are overwhelmed so that we will know we have to deal with something it gets better now that you know what it is also i have mental illnesses and mine are caused by brain chemical imbalances; when i take my medication and keep my therapy appointments i am a completely different person and functioning in this world is a lot easier i am actually happy and helpful sometimes,0
never heard of a therapist saying such crazy stuff like the one you seen any educated therpist should be able to understand and help let the new therpaist know all your feeling as its all real and a struggle good luck,0
i have seen four different therapists the third one i made the most progress with but i could tell st the end when i hit a plateau she got frustrated and gave up but the fourth one helped because i was comfortable enough with her to be able to talk about things while im not sure i will ever be 100% comfortable with anyone she helped a lot i guess what im saying is you are not alone and tbat there are others that are or have been in your position i know its hard but give it a fair shot and dont be afraid to get right to the point and tell them that you are hesitant about being there and why it will help them to better help you,0
dont give up  i hope the person who upset you isnt working-class with people anymore there are good therapist out there who care  sending a hug,0
i understand god bless you i struggle everyday as well with my grandson i love him so much i hope you find comfort he is my for living,0
i was the same at 16/17 and i found once my mum and dad stopped over compensating for me i really had to push my self and get on with things ive now had the same job for one year and im doing driving  i still struggle with anxiety and my mood disorder everyday but i know when i feel crap i might not feel the same tomorrow  there are lots of anxiety treatments  light therapy  cbt i listen to music every night on youtube for anxiety there are also anxiety apps on iphone and android that are very good as it works when asleep your ears are the only thing that dont sleep at night  so it is gradual and you might not nessacerily notice any changes at first ,1
yes completely i fear so much for the time im not here to care for him my son is 17 too and his anxiety can be crippling it is bad enough now for him but at least he has me to lean on and to help him but i am so worried about the future who will look after him when im not here? it almost makes life seem that much more fragile i think as parents we beat ourselves up all the time when we cant fix our children we dont have all the answers even though we are constantly wracking our brains trying to do our best im also trying to decide how to address the anxiety whether there is any effective therapy or medication to help with that as with my son and with your by the sound of it the anxiety is stopping them from living any form of normal life its heartbreaking to see them suffer they lose out on so much its so unfair i dont think many people understand how awful it is im sure you are doing a wonderful job its an ongoing dialogue between supporting them and not doing too much for them we can only do our best all we can do is gently encourage but a lot of the recovery or steps forward have to be governed by them they cant be pushed too far or too fast im sure you are doing a great job but the conditions are so difficult to deal with there are certainly no easy answers thats what makes it all so frustrating i hope you have others to help you perhaps to allow your son lean on others too to share the load from you and for him to be able to trust others enough so he can become a little less dependent on you because i know it can be exhausting best of luck to you both xx,0
it was this fear and bipolar that made me make really stupid decisions in my younger days my self-esteem had plummeted pretty much to zero its never recovered,0
im more afraid of what desperate person might fall in love with me anybody that would fall for me likely has more issues than i do! :p,0
im really afraid that my view of myself is reality and im really that worthless,0
ethan do you have a close friend a relative or a counselor that you can turn to in times of trouble? you should likely have a personal safety plan prepared (meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed vulnerable or suicidal) you definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder if you arent already its an illness that needs to be medically treated you definitely cant change that by yourself its like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it thats not how it works you probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain you need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you your depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops (just in case you dont know what that is as many people wouldntthats when you get the same awful negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind you try to get away from them but they often are intrusive and disturbing) depression is bad about causing those you sound like you might also have a bit of ptsd from being bullied all of those things can be treated well and effectively you need to see a doctor if you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself please seek out help at a hospital there are people who can help you and who will care for you and ethan i know this may be hard for you to believe right now but you never deserved to be bullied you didnt ask for it the bullies were the ones who were 100% in the wrongand not you please do not take to heart anything they mayve said about you bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with quite often they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there heres the thingtheyre in the wrong and im sure the things they said about you were cruel awful and negative i dont know you personally but i do know that no oneand i mean thisno one deserves to be treated like that please dont let them keep bullying you even now in your mind whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind try to confront them try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the good that im sure exists in you and all the good youve done in your life those bullies didnt know the real youthe one deep inside only you and those closest to you really know you so dont let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment you have only my very best wishes for a better future,0
i think it could be suggesting that even if you have a mental illness and struggle being a mum never stops,0
dont be afraid of the medication please celexa is known for having few side effects and it can be extremely helpful,1
hey guys im the one that ask this to be posted :( nervous but i didnt know it was a real thing and they want me to take celexa but i also have a fear of taking medication so its been on my counter for the last year :(,1
wow ! i may have to private message u maybe we can help eachother out im only 3 months pregnant but i think it is some un treated post partum with my son and having him 15 weeks early :( stress didnt help either but i wish i didnt have a fear of taking it i dont know what it is about it just scard idols only 10mg to start with but congratulations on ur baby ♡,1
i am 6 months pregnant with my first and most of my pregnancy ive been very depressed no idea why ive wanted to be a mom for a long time so sometimes i feel even worse because i beat myself up for feeling like this but i cant control it it just got really bad about 2 months in i literally dont feel normal i just want to stay locked in my bedroom all day and all night and most days i do just that i am on celexa i was on it before i got pregnant but since ive been feeling so bad my ob actually increased my dose a couple months ago i feel like its helped but im still not 100% feeling like myself or "normal" i see my doctor tomorrow and im hoping she can recommend something to help without increasing my dose again because im already nervous about being on medication while pregnant even though my doctor has reassured me over and over again it is safe and the risks are very low i can relate to what youre going through so you can talk to me if it might help today i just started crying and couldnt stop im just so drained from feeling like this i want to be excited and motivated about this pregnancy and i just want to be a good mom i think you should talk to your doctor again soon and i personally think you should try the celexa it could really benefit you it does take about a full month to kick it but in the long run it could totally help you hope you start to feel better soon,0
pretty hard  i got very parinoid and and got involved in risky behavior within a month of being off meds i halted my meds all together so i feel if it was tapered off it wouldnt have induced symptoms i stabilized after 2 months and then went through the vicious cycle again try tapering off much better effect  i did well that time,1
you are beautiful and you are worth something you have to focus the need to cut on something else hun i carnt say it will get better because every situation is different but you can manage it with help and a good support network depression runs in my family and it was unspoken about for years at it was seen as shameful but now its better because we talk openly about it my mother my sisters myself and my sons and daughter have all self harmed and its hard to talk about it i hope you find some light in your darkness and hope you can get help maybe some professional help hope it helps to know you are not alone and it can be hereditary  thoughts are with you i get that when you bleed the emotions are being released thats called blood letting you can be brutally honest with me as nothing phases me its not disgusting its a coping mechanism although a dangerous one we are all here for you whenever you need us,1
i am a recovering self harmer i see it as being like an alcoholic you are never really over it first of all i strongly encourage you to seek out a crisis hotline in your area please therapy can really help for more immediate relief i used this method and it will sound weird: squeeze ice cubes they give a burning sensation which gives you that pain feeling but doesnt have a lasting injury and the actual physical force of squeezing them released tension and stress for me i hope this helps i would also draw what i wanted to cut instead of actually cutting,1
hugs i also struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts i wish i knew how old you are so i could try to help,0
im sorry you are feeling this way i used to be a cutter too until i eventally had a big break down and saw a psychologist & psychiatrist i have managed to stop self harming and live a mostly happy & calm lifd you can work through this xx did you know that if you text 0410 526 562 ( white wreath ) when you are feeling depressed suicidal or just needing someone to talk to a crisis counselor will text with you? many people do not like talking on the phone and would be more comfortable texting its a free service rememberits ok to be not oknever be afraid to ask for helpone day you might be someone elses life line,0
first off you need to report your boss nobodyand i mean nobodyin the authoritive position should be using words of profanitymuch less belittle any employee go as high up the chain of command until you find someone who will listen and investigate it record it and send it via email if you have to as for youre seeing a therapistgo i cant stress that enough its not anyone around you whose life is at jeopardy its yours!!!! you need professional help there should be some kind of hotline for crisis you can call on yourself if not go to the emergency room please do this for yourself your life matters and you matter get some help now i am not a cutter but i do understand as i know people who have cut on themselves the feeling of trying to escape from the pain inside only to project that pain on the outside as a means of escape you can message me any time you need to just get that help you are desperately crying out for before its too late,0
hes saying bullshit not everyone has depression he doesnt understand anything i have depression and anxiety since basically i could talk and i know how hard it is to fake a happy act i get rages from my intermittent explosive disorder and cutting is the only thing that calms me down also i cut from guilt costing money and feeling such a burden ive been trying to stop but its not working its just who i am if your friends wont accept that im here for you drown yourself in fav music you arent worthless to me stay alive for me i dont want you to die ive been suicidal since 8 yrs old that was my first attempt and last year i basically died my body wasnt functioning and i was walking around out of my body i was terrified pls stay here for me <3,0
nicole anne matutina regala if this is for you your a very beautiful young lady and all i can tell you is dont let people make you ugly them scares are not for you ,0
ive dealt with self harming too in more ways than one i purposely bruise myself to relief anger and hate yet at the same time how much hurt i feel for even existing i also deal with more suicidal thoughts more frequently and hell im only 17 my mum wasnt supportive at first she constantly yelled at me for even the smallest things and my doctor and psychiatrists say that its just a way of attention seeking and is greedy because its causing more pain for others than myself i personally feel that no one understand the amount of emotional pain the smallest things effect me my mum only noticed how bad my mental state had gotten when i attempted suicide and kept telling her how much i wanted to die at first she just told me it was teen thing as did the doctors but then i was diagnosed with clinical depression however i feel as if its more than depression because i have traits of bipolar too i didnt self-diagnose myself i know others that are bipolar and they say some of my symptoms are like theirs too now dear i know its hard and im sure many of us have been in your situation before but just know youre not alone in any of this yes people will judge but that shouldnt determine who you really are no one knows you better than yourself dont let others drag you down and i think your mother should come to some sort of understanding that youre suffering with some mental issues (sorry if that comes along rude or anything like that) but instead of yelling at you she should comfort you reassure you and so on and not yell in my personal experience after cutting my wrists and thighs i felt terrible guilt and i wanted to stop so badly but didnt want to feel nothing because cutting myself made me feel something i still wanted to stop so what i did was id get an elastic band or hair band and keep it around my wrist and just ping the hair band/elastic band onto my wrist or arm as hard as i could and it may leave a red mark but it wont scar or anything take deep breathes too 5 seconds inhaling 7 seconds exhaling and continue until you feel okay crying is also okay to do youre human so its okay to cry if you feel alone remember youre not alone there are people out there who are just like you whether you know them or not itll all get better eventually i assure you sweetheart i hope my words have some sort of help for you and im sorry also if i made it seem all about me i just wanted to show you that youre not alone ,0

i was a cutter for 12 years have not cut now for 6 years it is an addiction and it actually helps to treat it as such on the road to your recovery start with trying 1 day without cutting and go from there have a reward system in place for when you succeed there will be stumbles but keep pushing through i suffer from cptsd and bipolar i still get urges to self harm when im overwhelmed but when i do i look at my scars and just how far i have come you can do it you will move past it and you will be stronger for it all the best xx,0
weekly therapy proper medication can improve depression dramtically(no shame in medsdont let anyone tell you this theyve saved my life) i am recovering cutter too ive actually at my worst cut the word alone into my arm because ive felt very much like you my coping me hanism is i take a sharpie and write messages to myself on my arm such asstay strong or have hope i also wear two bracelets that i never take off that say hope and warriorknow youre not alone i dropped all religion when in phsch ward best thing i ever did if it makes you feel bad about yourself it needs to gojob family religion etc its not easy to do trust me i know dont speak to parents andrecently gave up good paying job to flip burgers but guess what my old manager was a an asshat who insulted me daily and now im both free and happier its a lifelong struggle andtheyll always be bad days but it does get better with proper treatment and medication you are loved and matter to me even though i dont know you i understand,0
i have been clean for 2 months now and ive cut for years ive stopped before but i couldnt keep that going for me selfharm was a way to quiet the war inside my head and body but i also used it as punishment now two months ago i looked at my scars and theyre bad and thought: it has been enough i dont know something clicked which i didnt have before i wanted to quit for myself and no one else but i still find it extremely difficult cause when i feel bad and i am tense my mind automatically goes to selfharm but what kinda helps me may be weird but i look at pictures of selfharm and while i do that the urge subsides and i also have a buddy system i have one person who knows about it and that i want to quit and asked her to help me in a way that i can call or message her when the urge is really strong but i find that the buddy system is a hard thing for me to do since its a huge step to ask for help and what also helpes me is that i dont want to be to harsh on myself i say to myself that its okay if i relapse someday that might happen it kinda takes the pressure away a bit that helped me when i quit cannabis too just know you are not alone and you can message me if you want to!,0
i know for myself i thought i was not worthy of people or having nice things in my life because im bi polar so i would allow abusive behavior from others im 52 now and have lived with the diagnosis for almost 10 years but i defiantly can tell you  you deserve better look for another job first then march in to that mans office and tell him to shove it up his --- !! you are beautiful with and without scares!! everyone has scares but just not everyones are seen please reach out to someone and ask for help it does not have to be friends or family just someone im proud of you for reaching out to us i will pray for you!!!,0
you are not alone in this fight i also suffer from depression and anxiety i understand the pain of no one else understanding what im going through but let me tell you it gets better i know this because i almost took my life last night if it werent for my aunt then i wouldnt be here i also know the joy of cutting but truly its a way to cope with your emotions if you want to talk you can talk to me ill always listen,0
i stopped because i had children and was worried if anyone told it would be possible i might get my babies taken away i have 3 nieces and i have seen the marks on all of them and i feel guilty like i was a bad influence on them i have scars and it is embarrassing for me the best advice i can give is to talk to someone you trust who wont be all judgemental on you someone who will let you het your emotions out so you dont feel the need to take it out on yourself therapy really helps too but it seems that may be an issue for you financially maybe look up a support group for help then also in therapy they teach you coping methods of things to help you keep from harming yourself exp: journaling listen to music go for a walk do some art work or call a friend whatever helps you personally every one is different good luck to you ❤,1
its okay at least i realized im not alone in this kind of struggle ,0
i currently struggle with this and have for over 20 years i also think dbt is a great way to go as far as learning new coping skills when you can get the help personally i have found that drawing on myself with red markers or squeezing ice helps a bit sometimes if i have old clothes i dont wear anymore i slash or rip them i used to pick up henna kits because its kind of like making scabs i hope you can get the therapy that will help you there are people who understand though i know it doesnt feel that way right now depression lies to us that way oh and a lot of people are posting the hotline which is great but if youre like me and uncomfortable talking in the phone there is a text line 741741 big hugs and thank you for speaking up and advocating for yourself!,0
thanks at first i thought im already crazy but knowing other people out there are experiencing the same struggles calmed me down if there are people who had overcome it i know i can too someday,0
im so sorry to hear that youre not getting the support you need that makes things so much more difficult! but please know that youre not alone and there are so many of us who are able to relate your issues are real when people invalidate your feelings its not really about you most often its about their own fear and ignorance thats never your fault,0
self harm addict for over 15 years its tricky becuase you cant talk with others in fear of triggering them i found rather then trying to stop how can i regulate and get to sobriety i am at the point where i go years apart and it took a long time but anyone can get there youve probably heard this a lot but dbt is ur best bet to learn to live with it you have to want to own it and cope otherwise it doesnt work my biggest helper was a mental health box i put chocalate photos red washable marker scented candle and lotionectitems to help you cope and ground yourslef if you can touch ground you can usually get urslef threw next craving coping mechanisms are learned then you have to use them i used think they were silly try this and dont work then not for you freeze a bunch of red koolaid ice cubes or if u got it fake blood when i would get a craving i would push the ice hard against my skin where i hurt and it melt looking like bleeding the ice is so cold you even get numb sensation where you push also can try drawing red lines then do the red ice you get more effect afterwards id clean up and put kid bandaids all over where i did itworked for me cant hurt to try no pun intended,1
please try to get help ik its hard cause i struggle with this as well  trust me ik what you mean but seeking help would be the best thing hugs❤️❤️❤️ an stay strong,1
the following things i have done to help me over the years 1 i wear a hair band or rubber band on my wrist and snap it when feeling the urge 2 rub an ice cube on my forearm or inner thigh when feeling the urge it helps with the numbing 3 i trimmed down my nails also i see a therapist weekly and im in a bipolar/depression/anxiety therapy group every sat morning i havent had the urges in a few years but i have learned to recognize my triggers and how to de-escalate before it goes beyond my control i had to set limits in my life and cut people and things out of my life (triggers),0

i hear the misery you are feeling depression is the pits & makes us think bad things about ourselves so we definately need to be able to tell someone how awful we feel we want to be understood what we are fighting with inside at times a professional is our best port of call can you reach out to one person or service? please do this is tough stuff,0
not everyone has depression your boss is a twit depression is an illness thats like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes hes an idiot about self-harmquite often self harm is caused by a need to have control in ones own life (a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix) its time you got some control back 1 this is of the utmost importance get a new job theres absolutely no reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer he should show more professionalism you shouldnt have to put up with it i know its scary but youll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job ive worked a lot in my life and ive only ever had one boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees first time she did it to me i quit that moment please dont put up with that crap its apparent the job doesnt give you insurance so theres no reason for you to be there when you can find something better maybe your next job shouldnt be as a customer service rep? it doesnt seem to be a good fit for you personally especially at this point in your life look into doing things youd love instead 2 friends dont just run away when things get rough true friends will do what they can to help you maybe its time you assessed the people you have been hanging around? you need to find new friends (real ones) but you cant do that until you get your depression under control 3 go back to church there has to be like the little volunteer lady or the pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate talk to them if nothing else ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling its free and it might help you somewhat (if nothing else youd have someone to talk to for a bit about what youre feeling) 4 check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area there may be a support group you can join you dont have to be alone depression is an illness it is systemic it starts in the mind but its not long before it takes control of the entire body you need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness youd go to the doctor for it if you must go to an er if theres a "charity" hospital in your town go to their er you desperately need to be treated for your depression you might need medications depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a persons brain you cant "sleep it off" it doesnt work that way thatd be like telling the person with diabetes (a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas) that they can just sleep it away thats not how any of this works if you take nothing else from my post please remember this depression is a liar it lies to you about your worth your own abilities your life and the people who love you it tells you that no one cares it says that everyone hates you or that theyd be better off without you it whispers that you will never be good enough or that youll never amount to anythingor your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled these are lies it says the same type of things to every sufferer those lies play like a broken record in your mind you need to get away from them medication and therapy would do a lot for you if youre cutting a lot you may need some hospital time it would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that youre sick dont kill yourself or anything like that please keep reaching out there are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you the world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you care for you and be there for you just keep trying,0
im using mederma to get rid of the scares i only started yesterday and there is a very noticeable difference already you can try something like that i hate people seeing my scares they dont want to have nothing to do with you but its all the time every day they dont want nothing to do with me  keep up the fight some day someone will come into your life and support you love you hugs,0
i used to self harm when i worked in a toxic atmosphere ever since i got away from that terrible job i quit cutting maybe you should look for a better job that isnt stressful and definitely without a jerk of a boss you deserve better than that you are worth it also counseling can help and a lot of them are on a sliding pay scale so not real expensive get the help you need! you are worth it!,1
first i think its important that you realize you are not alone you are not a burden your boss is ignorant because if he knew a damn thing about being mentally ill he wouldnt of ever said any of those things self harm is one of those things that only you can change its important to know you already have the power inside you to stop (btw i have over five severe mental illnesses and no one even knows bc i hide it so well so all this is coming from experience) you are a lot stronger than people give you credit for you are smart and deserve to be proud of yourself for reaching out for help therapists are a great idea and resource for people like us there are usually income based therapists in every location (in my state theyre called north key) but you can google it be strong keep pushing pray god has a plan for your pain he will turn your pain into progress when it rains look for rainbows when its dark look for stars dont let any one scare you away from god he is not what people make him out to be he loves you for who you are right where you are stay resilient things will eventually get better,0
i also feel so anxious and sometimes ask if god still loves me because of my self harm addiction but deep inside i love god thanks for your advice madeline ,0
i was here with no insurance and no hope i went to the er and committed my self my cutting scars are getting fainter as i age but i struggle every day the hospital got me connected with dr and programs that are free or sponsored please your understood you matter you can find another job or take a leave of absence please the hospital signed off my bills for hardship you are the one step from away from the right direction take it you are here,0
first of all if your boss is using offensive words you need to go higher is there a human resources department or a union rep or someone you can confide in? that should not ever be something an employee goes through whether youre dealing with your own personal issues or not do not believe what he said about venting that was entirely uncalled for if you have close friends or a family member or sibling you trust please please reach out people will surprise you thats one issue i struggle with my partner surprised me when i told him i had an episode this weekend he was genuinely worried and told me to call him next time (hes away for work) do you draw or have any extra curriculars/artistic talents or other hobbies? what about something like ripping paper when you get the urge to cut? have you seen a doctor or psychiatrist/counsellor? i encourage you to add that to your list it wont "solve" your problems but having that unbiased person you can talk to may help you make the changes you need please find the emergency numbers for your area theres several online resources you can even do online counselling if youre worried or not up for face to face! i hope you know you are not insignificant youre someones child friend and so much more the negative thoughts are one voice right now theyre just much louder than the positive voice take care and hugs!,0
always try to talk things through samaritans etc self harm can be a release from stresses or worries its like a release everyone will have different triggers and different ways of helping often its about finding something else to stop the thoughts and feelings exercise walking reading a book try speaking to your doctor and get some help and advice you have been so brave to know you need help and seek it,1
hi fellow friend please just go to hospitali know its scary  ive been there myself they will help you through what you are feeling,0
you can probably get help for free thru your county mental health dept you are worth something you might find another job that is less abusive and stressful prayers for you,1
loyalty doesnt mean you have to cut yourself off from half the human race thats just unhealthy my best friend is a girl i could never stop talking to her because im dating someone who is insecure,0
you have heard correctly it doesnt have to be that you get irritated and stay that way it can be a number of things for everyone it is different i went from bpii to bpi,0
just my thoughtssometimes we feel so intensly or were completely numb when we are depressed it feels hopeless and it will never be ok but thats not trueim sure youve felt similarly in the past just remember these feelings are temporary in the moment its so overwhelming especially if it goes on for a while i would suggest setting some goals even small ones until you can start feeling hopefull again it creates future thoughts and will help you get back on track((hugs)),0
hi there how old are you if you dont mind my asking you are right to think of your loved ones see a doctor please please please im almost 50 years old i have been struggling most of my life this hurdle is hard but i promise you will get through it gather as much information you can so you will have the material with loved ones i know that there are cultural differences and beliefs if you need more support ask about support groups stick with this group because you matter and we all love you truly,0
i battle with bipolar disorder 2 anxiety and depression and its tough but you cant hold your feelings in you have to tell your family and friends anyone that will listen i tried ending my life 2yrs ago but god must of had a plan for me cause im still here im on alot of medication eating right taking the right medicine and talking to your dr or therapist is very important if you ever want to talk look me up sherry vaughn on messenger i would be glad to talk to you good luck,0
i live for love the love that i have for others the love they have for me; i live for the love i have at hearing the birds sing in the early mornings and i live for the love of walking among the trees and just being sure i suffer from the maddening depression and the loneliness that consumes me i fear the people i see around me and the stress and anxiety that overwhelms me but through all of the suck in life i choose to live for the fleeting moments of love,0
ive been battling depression/anxiety/bipolar 1 and a host of mental illnesses most of my 30 years of life i can sit here and tell you inspiring words and stories to make you temporarily feel better but the unfortunate truth is that our minds are so damn stubborn that it will not last for me music finding meaning purpose and ultimately an abundance of hope was key to making what feels like to me a recovery of sorts or at least to be able to manage and control my mind more so than my mind controls me i dont know what that is for you but never stop being curious and wondering about the truth and all the mysteries life has to offer it is truly boundless for me it was this realization that humanity is one and through democracy and engaging ones self in what provides you meaning purpose and hope that i was able to conquer my mind i think it boils down to perspective and dwelling in future possibilities along with support from family friends therapists doctors and medication it takes years to find the right balance of support but i can tell you that once you make it through your hell heaven awaits on the other side i know im talking in vague terms but this is how my mind works and like any other muscle in the body if we train it well the mind can become our most valuable asset instead of our worst enemy although i dont know you i have hope that you will overcome your demons and come out incredibly stronger for it i hope that one day you come to realize this balance and are able to see and feel the positivity that many people bring to this world you are not alone in your darkness,0
you need your family and friends support! i am bipolar ptsd add and when my problems first started is was sooo hard! i hit the lowest of lows and they could not find the right meds to help it was horrible it took many many drugs and a long time to get somewhat stable but my kids all know my issues and my husband is so understanding about my illness may i ask if you see a psychiatrist and are you on meds if so which ones?,1
ive been there too - i think what you need now is concrete steps to help lift you up just a little and then once you are up a little you can start to help yourself out of this here are some concrete steps you can take that will help you feel a little bit better within a week - please try them!! the biggest problem with depression is we do not even try the steps people advise us to take because we dont believe they will work do them anyway please!! 1) get at least 9 hours sleep per night - if you cannot sleep by midnight take one tylenol pm - this is the safest sleeping pill on the market if it makes you too groggy cut it in half and take half a pill but whatever happens you need to sleep 9 hours per night 2) make it a regular sleep - go to bed at the same time each night (9:30pm for example) and get up at the same time each night 3) dont drink caffeine or alcohol - if you love coffee get a decaf coffee substitute - there are nice tasting ones out there if you like to drink fruity cocktails replace it with orange juice and lemonade mixed together (tastes just as good as cocktails) with cranberry or cherry juice added if you like 3) get a counsellor and book an appointment every week for an hour each week if you dont have health insurance use online counselling like talkspace - google it 4) every day go for a walk for at least one hour outside - not in a shopping mall - outside where you come into contact with nature in some way even if you hate the idea of going for a walk and everything in your body is telling you not to go for that walk go anyway if you can get a friend to go with you or family member or whatever 5) dont eat sugary or fatty products eat foods that are as close to straight out of the ground as you can even if that sounds horrible please do it it will really help 6) attend a support group - emotions anonymous is a great one - often local churches and mental hospitals have support groups for people with depression - find one and attend - i know its very very difficult but you will be so glad you did! i know these steps sound completely impossible but please try them - they will help you feel so much better if you are in that place where even these simple steps are just completely impossible consider full time therapy as an outpatient to a local mental hospital,1
never hide your struggles whether you tell just one person or your whole circle is up to you you need someone in your corner that will help you when you need and who knows what you struggle with me personally i suffer from depression and anxiety and kept it to myself for years and it got really bad a few months ago but i told my two best friends and they have been able to help me when i feel it coming on they know my struggles and they help you need someone to help you seriously even having just one person to share this burden will ease it so much for you,0
i am going through the same thing as p x but i still dont know how to come to terms with me having a mental illness i am seeing a counsler and a psychologist and on meds but still cant shake the feeling of being alone i have a wife and kids but things with wife arent going good between us im just feeling lost,0
i know this feeling this struggle is real and scary to at times,0
do you have a loved one a significant other i just started therapy and that seems to be helping me although the last couple days been horrible for me as well just mustering the energy to get up out of bed sometimes as ugh i do it because i have 3 kids that i love dearly and a fiance that i adore you can trust me when i say almost everybody has thought about ending their battle once in their life which is very saddening because life goes so fast and theres so much amazing things in it to experience if we allow ourselves im here if you want to talk,0
one of my favorite psychologists was in a rural setting the rural life can do wonders for mental health be proactive and seek support but dont be afraid of this change! it can truly be wonderful,0
rural is a lot less scary than urban  and waaaaay less scary than metropolitan fresh air and sunshine do wonders for my anxiety,1
one of the best things i ever did was pack my bags one day leave everyone everything behind and moved to honolulu hawaii to become a chef it was 6 years ago i didnt know anyone here it took me a month to find an apartment in culinary school no previous experience i used to be like 335lbs i swear i lost 100lbs the first cple months just from being a nervous wreck but im still alive and kicking i think that was the turning point for me when i decided i was in control of my life not whatever illness talk to your tutors whatever you need to do to process at some point whether its this or an event 5 years down the road you are going to be looking at similar roadblocks good luck with whatever you choose to do!,0
im a second year pharmacy student and though i have my own set of severe issues there are still certain requirements that i have to meet if i want to be a pharmacist i chose this career knowing the requirements and knowing my issues and accommodations only go so far i get extended time and private test taking for anxiety alone i medicate well when i have rotations to answer your question i have told my lecturers associate dean provost basically anyone that could support me and be in my corner but they have not given me options for special treatment in regards to rotations believe me i totally feel where you are coming from i had to run to my therapist once or twice a week to help me recover from the anxiety use your resources while meeting the requirements you chose this career and you are strong enough to do it! im not being mean just telling you what ive run across we still have to be respected professionals for our patients regardless of our own baggage if we want our careers bad enough! good luck!,0
well put jennifer anxiety is a bitch and shell thrust herself into ur life like theres no tomorrow! anxiety imo is the most harmful of disorders! itll tell u things that just arent true and convince u they are and on and on,1
i was called a nervous nellie growing up all i ever had were gut feelings and they were seldom wrong,0
well in all fairness when you suffer from anxiety your gut is seldom right but it doesnt mean the feeling isnt real,1
are you connected with a counselor or therapist? it is possible to do some visualization/cbt/anxiety reduction in preparation for the placement that could make it very possible,1
i wasnt done my family didnt want to hear it my life changed for the better once i got the right meds try to leave information around for family members can look at remember they love you more than you fear talkin to them i hope i helpedhugs,0
hi i suffer from depressionanxietyi was diagnosed as bipolar 2 ive been on many different medications and i felt like a guinea pig but it seems now im on the right ones its a struggle everyday god made you special and dont forget it if you ever need to talk reply to this message ok,1
i also suffer from depression and anxiety from the early years of my child hood i get it i understand so you can always message me if you want to talk im only an inbox away,0
i was diagnosed younger than that with depression placed on so many different types of meds over the years went to a therapeutic boarding school that was abusive so many rehabs and other insane life events now im 32 no contact with my family the docs tell me anti depressants are bad for me i have raging bipolar type 1 w psychosis then are changing the diagnosis again now i think doctors forget that we are all individuals and cant be treated the same way the human psyche is to complex to mass diagnose every jackass doctor has a different opinion and prescription currently i self medicate by microdosing marijuana i say wtf is on my mind to anyone i talk about my feelings/problems and if people dont like it kick rocks i get where your coming from with your depression and overload of responsibilities and others n ot understanding i was there one day i just said fuck it and felt alot of anxiety go away i also eat very differently now more of a vegetarian non processed food thing going its supposed to help also idk if that helps but that thats the advice i wish i got at 21 i dont talk to anyone i did back then not sure why i cared what people thought abt me so much for whoever can message me if you ever need to talk i dont judge people,0
depression is experienced in the mind body and soul ive found various adaptogenic herbs to help find counsellors or help groups find people you can reach out to there are 7 billion people on this planet ,1
sometimes not even a doctor can help being a bipolar manic depressive that i am i was prescribed 3 antidepressants all at one time they didnt seem to help so stopped taking them but as for me i maintain my illness through faith of my higher power & surround myself w/positive environment maybe being honest with urself what causes ur depression & anxiety it could very well be ur family causing the depression and anxiety u knw things like trying to live their expectations of u and feeling accepted by those that say that they love u keep in mind that i am not a doctor or a therapist but i do know this i had to cut ties w/my family in order to start living a happier life please know that i am not trying to tell u how or what to do with ur life im just telling u what worked with me i hope this will give u a little encouragement to start feeling better about urself!,0
im here im glad to talk whenever you need someone i have anxiety and bipolar 1,1
if anyone is struggling here is a list of various support numbers you can call they have something for everyone ,0
oh well at least i dont have to be afraid shes coming home pregnant ,0
i was on sertraline and changed to esetalopram its worked wonders pregabaling can make your anxiety worse than help you it works well then you need more to stop the anxiety the next day its a horrible drug maybe a suggestion but esetalopram is better n i dropped 2 drugs for it hope you feel better soon xx,1
i am on 200 sertoline 150 pregabolin and 50 quitiapene and i am still in a bad place where i struggle to do simple tasks and never go out i hope your meds get sorted for you mate but it is hard when they keep messing with em,0
its horrible i am isolated from outside as my panic attacks are bad dont deal well with things,0
i take 20 mg trintellix daily but dont have bipolar i have ptsd anxiety and depression,1
i cant really tell if its working or not to tell you the truth im on 3 other meds for anxiety i can tell those work,1
neurotin (gabapinten) is not high enough to help with anxiety,1
completely understand i couldnt go without my meds i am always trying to get the right combination have struggled for years hoping i will get there one day,0
doctors do not know how any drug will affect a patient as they affect everyone differently they throw drugs at you in hopes something might work we all need to do our own research which is incredibly hard when one is struggling i have found the anti depressants to be very severely debilitating and do not take them anymore if you are bipolar the first med to try is lithium at a low dose about 300 mg and work up every other week please dont just take things because a doctor tells you to honestly i have learned many of them do not have a clue and can cause huge issues in someone trust your gut i think your doctor sounds frustrated that he has not been able to help you and is reaching at straws to try another answer i would try another doctor or two,1
i was treated for major depression disorder for years mostly by my gp after i started seeing a psychiatrist i was given a questionnaire to fill out then she diagnosed me bipolar based on those questions we tried several meds over a period of time ive been on my current program for several years i take 600mg seroquel and 40mg viibryd im also on pain meds for fibromyalgia i take neurontin (gabapentin) 400mgs twice a day for nerve pain ultram (tramdol) 100mgs twice a day for muscle pain celebrex 200mgs once a day for inflammation and i have klonopin 50 as needed (not everyday) for anxiety and skelaxin as a muscle relaxer as needed (not everyday) its a long list but its for two diagnoses and the fibro has a long list of symptoms since researchers havent decisively figured out what causes the fibro you can only treat the symptoms,1
celexa was horrid horrid horrid for me and gabapentin was useless,0
oh no iv to start seriquel on the 22nd for bipolar like yourself i have been getting treated for ptsd n anxiety disorders but like urself im now told iv got bipolar disorder can u tell me if the seroquel gives u the palpitations? thanks x,1
i really feel for you as i have had a similar experience was being treated for years for major depression ptsd anxiety i was on a shit load of medication and then i moved to a new state seeing a new psychiatrist who diagnosed bi-polar and started me on new meds but at the same time weaned me off the old ones i actually feel much better and have not had to be admitted into hospital for over a year which is a miracle for me i spent 10 long years in and out of hospital having long bouts of electric shock therapy and my body so pumped up with drugs that i literally could not move i wasnt living i was just existing seek other opinions from independent psych if you can i truly wish you all the very best on your journey to better mental health care ,1
is gabapenten generic for nerotin i take that with seroquell and they both helped me alot i had to give it time to be therapeutic but after a couple months with the new doctor my anxiety went down but pills can only do so much right i am sick of pills hand full in the morning handful at night if i dont i make a happy trip to the hospital,1
my doctor switched me to brintellix once and gave me samples to take home then when i tried to get my rx filled my insurance wouldnt cover it because there were cheaper alternatives so i had to switch back again whole thing was a waste of time and horrible on my body to just switch back and forth like that smh,0
everybodys system is different i have a sensitive system so my dr is very conservative as to any changes i would definitely see your dr to let them how you have reacted your concerns part of your anxiety maybe because of your recent knowledge of your diagnosis,1
neurontin works wonders for my anxiety though,1
seroquel made me anxious even at low doses,0
secondly meds only do half the work  you need tools to deal with you anxiety cbt is very good,1
dont worry about the bipolar diagnosis lots of depression is actually bipolar but undiagnosed its easier to deal with once you know what you have and get on the right drugs get off any drugs that give bad side effects asap though,1
because im suppose to be on neurontin for my nmo (which is an autoimmune disease like ms but worse) i am also bipolar have depression & anxiety,1
first of all that seroquel isnt gonna do crap at only 50mg i take 600-900 depending on the day the seroquel helped me cut my xanex needs in half so i dont get anxious as easily ive tried everything for about a 10 year period with no success until i started a mood stabilizer im bipolar and its all i needed,1
my psychiatrist wants me to start seroquel and i am petrified!!!had horrendous reaction to geodon w lomictal last fall during my 1st psych hospitalization last fall at 58 yrs old for my 1st mania lasting about 9 months including cutting which i havent done since 14 yrs old!they took me off geodon and lomictal xanaxcitalopramnow on clonazepam and mirtazapine but severely deppressed and dont know what to doso scared to start more medsalso had psychotic reaction to prozac about 30 yrs agoi also have cirrhosis of the liver and most meds have liver warnings but all of my psychiatrists dont seem to worry about thisstuck in a dark room and dont know how to get outdeppressed all my lifesurvivor of severe long term childhood traumaptsd! still not sure if i am bipolar!?anyone trying cbd oils with any success?any feedback appreciatedi cant seem to crawl out of this holefrozen in fear,1
i took 50mg of seroquel once a day and 100 mg of trazodone and as soon as i started the seroquel i had bad anxiety attacks & panic attacks & even attempted to commit suicide but everybody is different it bothers some people and some it doesnt,1
i took seroquel and it gave me terrible panic attacks! everyone has their own reaction to each drug what works for me may not work for you! goos luck!,1
with bipolar if you tend to be depressed the majority of the time it is often misdiagnosed as major depression ive had some doctors (for short periods of time because of their short-sidedness) that argued with me that i did not have bipolar because they hadnt witnessed any mania/hypomania in the 2 visits over 8 weeks they had been seeing me the only medication you mentioned that i dont know much about is the neurontin the others you are on shouldnt have any adverse reactions with each other but that doesnt mean you wont have adverse reactions to them the doses of the others you are on are fairly low doses if you have been on them for several weeks at least and are still having the panic and other side effects talk to your doctor about adjusting dosages if you have just started on them give it a few weeks (unless the symptoms get unbearable/life threatening) for your body to adjust to them its very possible this just isnt a good combination for you nothing but time and trial and error can figure out what will work,1
trial and error diagnosed at 14 major depressive 18bipolar and bpd also anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder last year speak to your doctor again explain everything and possibly see a psychiatrist (although im assuming after having your diagnosis you may already be in touch with one already)? im now 30 and truly trial and error everyone reacts differently to medications good luck,1
i doubt that been alone way to long seems law of averages would have come in by now ha,0
3 always panic attacks so strong i almost fainttightness of the chest a mix of ptsd large groups or new situations with large groups is overwhelming,0
would probably say number 3 i do find it hard to concentrate feel tired sometimes and suffer with anxiety if i need to do something different or have to attend something that i am not comfortable with,0
yesthats me i worry about othersbut talk about mine,0
i dont take on others problems but it stresses me out more than it should when my friends are going through a hard time,0
my anxiety has been thru the roof my spouse and i havent been getting along,1
im on a constant roller coaster im glad i have a boyfriend who loves me and is very understanding he just went through the first episode with me yesterday of a bad anxiety attack i took my meds but i needed to be outside of course it was raining but i had to get away there were to many people in the house and i was feeling closed in when i thought i was feeling better i went to set with him and i wasnt feeling better he had everybody leave he just held me and talked me through it and well the rest of the night was amazing he is the best i love him so much i couldnt ask for anyone better,0
oh dear unfortunately yes that was the reason i started to go to counselling to try and escape the numbness it was a horrid but worth while journey i have slipped many times since counselling finished but ifeel i can now manage the dark days that come along there is help out there please access it x,0
if it wasnt for my beautiful daughter i honestly dont think i could wake up everyday with how i feel lately i have tried to rekindle my love for drawing reading writing its just all too stressful i am forcing myself out to events and seem to be ok but i return home and its like i instantly forget these feelings you have you are definitely not alone,0
i know exactly where youre coming from i fight it everyday its a struggle but im fighting it and im going to win so can you good luck,0
you cant worry about her being mad at you two she will forgive when she gets the help that she needs you are the parents get her help!,1
sounds like she needs to be hospitalised  dont worry about her being mad its difficult being a parent but you trying to get her help praying for all of you,1
since you are having problems she might be genetically inclined toward depression but she also has to deal with living with your problems she definitely needs help with that maybe not a hospital but she does need some help its hard enough being a teenager but being a teenager with a depressed parent? it can feel hopeless and miserable she might not need medications; she might just need a mentor who isnt depressed if you cant meet her needs it would be the kind thing to do to find someone who can meet her need to talk things through and find a way to continue towards maturity,1
she may be mad at first but she needs to be somewhere someone i knew had a daughter who took a bottle of pills because never in a million years did she expect her daughter to do herself harm even with her depression and anxiety issues she could have died or been a vegtable thankfully shes ok you dont know what your daughter is capable of put her in a hospital and if she cries and is mad etc stay strong its for her own good her life depends on it!,1
she should see a doctor as soon as possible ive literally been where you are and now my son is dead dont be afraid of her being angry with you now she will forgive you my prayers are with you,1
this is pretty judgemental yes get her to a doctor asap we all have trouble with difficult decisions especially when we are struggling ourselves,0
stabilitymy anxiety gets me thinking stupid things i just want peace of mind and stability in my life damnit lol,0
thanks for the supportive comments and suggestions  i still feel so hopeless and worthless and depressed and anxsious and insecurities and self hate and pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow  its not getting better  im tired of pretending to be strong and tired of pretending im ok im just fed up  but the positivity has helped in encouraging me  feel like giving up still  see no point in going on i appreciate the kind words though i just dont know how i going to get through all this cuz its m really struggling  ive been strong to long  im fed up,0
someone i can truly trust to confide in it sure isnt my man i do not trust him with my inner deep feelings i always seem to feel that he is a liar and im not sure about it at times like a conartist f with me some of my days are okay and some are packed with confusion tons of stress love--hate relationship on my behalf i want my cake and eat it too at times life at times is very tormenting inside my mind i dont know if im coming or going,0
relief i have anxiety n depression  i worry about everything n i get so down,1
money! to end the debts bills and financial worries,0
a constant my life is changing so rapidly and i feel like im getting tossed around without anything to keep me balanced ive lost friends and family im scared of not having anyone left ive tried different things: relationships food medication religion no matter what i hold on to it doesnt feel like anyone wants to care relationships have become meaningless food becomes poision medication puts you on more medication to fix the problems medications cause and religion is so often shunned or used as a weapon rather than love i just want something to focus on and focus on me back you know?,0
a dog trainer a nanny something to predict when panic attacks are going to happen,0
help but probably most of all understanding and support i want the stupid panic attacks to stop i want people that really care about me and not just say it so they feel better i want a dad that isnt constantly confusing and hurting me maybe a bf or gf that does answer my texts and is there for me when i need him and not just start a conversation and immediatly goes away after i want a friend that doesnt try to kill me and people that stop hurting me and pushing me back because im coming out as trans my depression got better but my anxiety worse,0

tamara edie-jenkins it helps allot i also suffer social anxiety disorder it helps with both as well as my insomnia tried to cute smoking before i got the card but it didnt work to well my mood was everywhere my therapist even recommended me to continue to smoke because its the only thing she sees that works for me theres 4 types i have to take cbd meds which has very little thc and another which both i take orally those are for my bipolar depression then two types of oil vie the vapor pen which one is to take before bed and the other for my anxiety so i would definitely recommend it for someone who has tried everything but havent found anything that helps,1
my lithium caused bad acne for me so i just stopped taking it a month ago and im all over the place well and i was worried about the thyroid side effects,1
i would recommend a psychiatrist as well gps get paid a nice stipend for each patient they prescribe certain medications so they may be more likely to encourage one over another thats not necessarily going to be as helpful to you plus they have limited knowledge on a wide variety of things so theyre not going to have the experience to help if you like to read i would also suggest that you pick up a copy of warrior goddess training: becoming the woman you were meant to be and/or feeling good: the new mood therapy i liked the activities in feeling good but i struggled getting through it after a while warrior goddess training im currently reading and really like the idea of shedding societal norms but i do struggle to focus on some of what it says mind you im also a newly single mom of 2 kids ages 2 and 5 so my attention span isnt the greatest!! good luck with whatever you decide,0
prayer and bible study seriously learning that god wants the best for everyone and that he wants me to "flee from sexual immorality"(1 corinthians 6:18) and to "abstain from sexual immorality each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor not with greedy uncontrolled sexual passion" (1 thessalonians 4:3-5) has quite literally helped me to overcome this disorder you can win this battle too it includes keeping busy in "holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion" getting your mind off your sexual urges and desires prayer serious prayer begging for help to control your passions is vital you can find more bible information on this topic at woljworg where you can search for published articles on bible topics it would be wise to seriously consider beginning the free bible study program from jehovahs witnesses you can request one on their website: jworg,1
im hyper sexual when im manic keep steady boundaries and practice self care you are vulnerable and need love not sex this is something you can provide for yourself safely,0
ive done a lot of things im so ashamed of ,0
it is so hard to deal with in my 40s and still have a difficult time it is like crack once it gets started if you are not in a committed relationship then have no shame you are who you are and adults can have sex with each other having a committed relationship and you stray that is the hard part you have to then decide if telling is only going to relieve your guilt or telling because they deserve to know,0
i always end up feeling like my partner has lost interest in me because they arent as sexual ive had an ex tell people that there was something wrong with me because of my sex drive its all quite upsetting the fact that hypersexuality is a part of me is hard to grasp even harder to know everyone doesnt think about sex as often as i do i have learned over the years to embrace it and but i still struggle good luck to you i hope you find some peace youre not alone,0
i dont have that problem i suffer from sexual disfunction nothing works never has think its my epilepsy with all my meds and now with all these anxiety and bipolar meds i dont think anything will work ever i just dont feel anything,1
as a man that has bipolar disorder i also have hyper sexuality my sex drive on a scale of 1 to 100 is set to 998 most of the time the best way to deal if self love and self control lol but i do understand the stress that comes from it there is no amount of sex in the world that would fill that holestill i tryi find it hard to ask for sex because the chance that my wife will not be in the mood and the thoughts in my head telling me she is not in love with me that im not man enugh for her that i did something wrong start and it makes things so much worse you just have to be strong and remind your self that that its not your fault and its not in your control pick your self up and keep moving thats what i do to deal each day i hope this helps!,0
very hard to deal with makes you feel ashamed cause you come on too strong and then that gives you a reputation and so that turns you into a recluse or an outcast of sorts who still has good in your heart but instead of wasting anyones time or being put through the ridicule of it all again and again youre left alone to face youre bi-polarizing thoughts all that time and youre sexual urges which leads to chronic masturbation best thing is find a sex addict program which isnt easy people are really hard on those of us who have this and while it is a part of bi-polar it can co-develop from childhood abuse too or you can be born very hypersexually activemeaning having the sensuals of it at a very young age and not really knowing why or what to do with them they have medication if you look it up also and have doctors to speak with,0
its horrible as a man i have problems with it,0
i screwed my wife 7 xs a niteonly cheated out of sight never embarrassed her but on every trip i got laidotherwise i took my extreme sexuality out on my wife,1
constant struggle for me unfortunately ive become torn between having multiple partners (obviously a relationship burner) and using porn and strip clubs and the like to enhance self-pleasurefor which ive received much ridicule not a great "answer"more of an "i feel your pain daily",0
i consider myself hypersexual its like i need validation and sex is how i seek it i know that sex and love arent the same thing yet if my partner isnt in the mood i feel rejected and hurt by it its a struggle sometimes,0
i have mild anxiety and ocd but my sex drive has never really been affected by it i have taken citalopram sertraline and anafranil in my life but did not take sertraline for long as i did not get on with it made me feel sick alot and itchy with rashes,1
im glad im not the only one it really triggers my anxiety too im a hot mess lol lots of love to you ladies ❤,0
ill admit i slept with like 11 people in a year  not good now its a struggle bc my fiancée isnt too sexual so sorry no advice but i feel ya,0
i have bipolar i and borderline and every type of symptom that goes along with it i was a hypersexual child but i was never promicuous not that i will ever judge anyone that suffer with this my husband understands the fact that i am hypersexual we have had arguments about it in the past but he does love every part of my "madness"  there are many times when he is too tired or too stressed and those are the times i feel rejected or accuse him of cheating which is not true and it does drive me insane at times its "normal" ironically for someone thats hypersexual,0
im so thankful that i have such an understanding family and fiance in my life i can be very rough to deal/ live with even my upper manic stages are scary im very blessed thanks for the support guys!,0
it helped me when i was in a monogomous relationship i could stay faithful no prob my ex apparently (not bipolar) couldnt even though we had a very active sex lifeunfortunately i dont have any good advice for being single its been a struggle,0
patti erdman i was so ocd about everything had its place and if it was moved a 16th of an inch i went nuts the stuff had to be perfect i went so far as toothbrush and toothpicks in the cracks on the floor (tile floor) i hated it and i have shedding petslol sadly after the death of my boyfriend in september i went thru such a bad depression that my whole home went to shambles and i didnt care over the winter i shut down all rooms in my house except for my living room and bathroom the above photo is how bad my depression became and i didnt care  and that was my damned kitchen then we changed a couple of my meds (raised the dose) and i woke up one day toward the end of march and walked into my kitchen and was in shock i had been so bad with the depression i had not even realized what i was doing that photo was taken when i was about a quarter of the way done with cleaning it all up ive never in my life lived like that before and id been homeless for a bit way back and was cleaner then that it scared me to see what i was doing and not even being aware of my surroundings and i never ever want to become that depressed ever again for any reason thank god id shut off that part of the house before i ended up dead in that garbage pile or my pets did ppl who dont understand how debilitating depression can become can gladly borrow my photo to show that someone is literally go out of our minds with it,0
me too i had a hystectomy in 2002 and a full thyroidectomy in 2008 thats a double whammy in the mood department throw in the depression anxiety plus ptsd and some health issuesbut then i got on wellbutrin 300 mg and when my thyroid levels are perfect my boyfriend loves it its like when we met 14 years ago lol my doc says wellbutrin is the "it" med in the right dose for getting the mojo back for some folks,1
i also suffer from bipolar depression and anxiety and have zero sex drive,1
tawnya coomer yes maam i am he gets it bc he struggles with back problems he has medal in it with pins and screws,0

donald jose khairullah that must be horrible d8 i am so sorry sweetie your brain must be hating so much on itself so much of the time i hope you find a way to work through and find a partner who is willing to work through it with you <3,1
same im demi with hypersexuality as well but also thanks to lots and lots of abuse i have an aversion to sex on top of that its really fucking confusing,1
i so agree susanne i see a lot of fellow suffers reacted negatively but for me it is a huge struggle as well especially for our spouses the ones we love most and hate to hurt always end up hurt! my hypo-sexuality is one of my extreme highs full of excited feeling that heat of the moment passion and yearning for something that always seems to be better away from home! i get you and theres more out there like us!,0
i thought guys would enjoy it but not all guys have a high sex drive mine has increased even more since ive been happier and less stressed ive always have a high drive since i was really young but my past relationship was terrible so i never wanted it im obsessed with porn too but have been staying away so it doesnt affect my sex life,0
i am bipolar and suffer from anxiety and depression i too face the struggle of hypersexuality ,1
he agreed to give me the amount of sex i wanted in a week guess what i got moaning his dick was sore and his tummy muscles too booooo hard life right ? yes you are right its hard not to think about something when you are addicted to it yet not getting your fix then i feel like im going without  and then angry and upset and then unwanted its a nasty cycle,0
im addicted to the high after sex so if i dont get it frequently i feel angry and upset that gets directed at whoever im with i feel unwanted and unloved without that addiction being satisfied having a higher sex drive than a man hits their ego it makes them feel like they arent satisfying me properly i have sexual dreams where i wake up wanting it but they are tired lol aww i get the  im addicted to sex and porn talk  before and then after the reality is they arent i duno how else to explain it its complicated and bloody annoying to live with,0
i wasnt upset just a bit confused as i said my apologies glad you have someone hanging out with you though :),0
ive found several things she commented on today that had ppl upset with me and i was kinda shocked cuz i didnt know what the hell i did lol,0
its horrible when you love someone whos sex drive is atleast 90% lower than your own i consider it a curse i wish i didnt want it as much so i wouldnt annoy her,0
i struggle with this so much and im bipolar,0
is this a huge issue with bipolar or anxiety or borderline personality does anyone know??,1
yes i have both and struggls,0
well i have bipolar i  borderline anxiety bulemia ocd ptsd and one specific symptom is hypersexuality since i was a child,1
i struggle with it drives me insane :(,0
just joking but must b hard this i dont really suffer from it just anxiety hope i made you smile i mean no offence,1
well if you have friends and theyre not supporting you in your struggles then theyre not your friends,0
what about counselling or psychology? she is at an age where she may be responsive to someone outside of the family unit and share in her current story with the hope of creating a different story for herself with hope passion and goal setting i wish you both so much joy and happiness dont hesitate to ask me any questions i work as a psychologist with adolescents and know there is so much hope ,1
jeffrey lebahn all the dinosaurs feared the t-rex,0
: we had two bags of grass seventy-five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high-powered blotter acid a saltshaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers downers screamers laughers also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of beer a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the ether there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon : lets give the boy a lift : what? no we cant stop here this is bat country!!!,0

eliminate triggers be industrious take medication if you need it but dont use your illness or meds as an excuse and make others responsible for your condition go to work the less time you have to think about things the less mania that can result and also people only give people the benefit of the doubt when you are well from my personal experience stand up dont be a victim and if you need meds take them regardless of anyone! poor judgement whatever if you eliminate triggers you are as normal as anyone else take care!!,1
i think a lot of times parents have a hard time accepting their child has mental health issues because they feel like it is their fault or they are being blamed or like they did something wrong so they will try to deny or ignore things like this also it is hard to understand what someone else is going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes so to speak i have bipolar and anxiety issues etc i had a close family member tell me that they never believed anxiety attacks were real until they had one their self that same family member got on medication and never told me about it i think she was embarrassed because she had secretly judged me for so long and it was too hard for her to admit that she was wrong,0
explain to her that diabetics need to take meds for life people with high blood pressure or heart problems have to take meds for life people who have had new organs like hearts lungs kidneys skin have to take anti rejection drugs every day of their life and you do too otherwise in one way or another you will die some people choose not to understand that the brain is another organ and can be chemically different causing illness just like liver failure causes illness !,1
i have been on lithium for 18 yrs as well as my anxiety meds am 41 i am also 9 months pregnant which meant having to stop all meds while pregnant i am bipolar/manic depressive with severe anxiety i was on my meds so long i didnt and to be honest i still dont know how to function without them its been a total shit of a nightmare without them i have side effects and withdrawals from not taking them my depression has taken over my entire pregnancy and life i have 4 weeks left and counting the days until i can get back on my meds so im not only asking but begging you to not stop taking your meds sorry so long,1
not going out it part of being mentally ill i am in utah and was told cause i was not following the gospel was all my problems being a addict and mentally is ok you need to just try to treat both i did best just making sure no matter what i would not use drugs i drop of the map no one i use drugs with could find me in my new apt deleted all their numbers and fully dedicadef no drugs you will feel the most benifit of your meds maybe want to go out or just feel better inside but dont ever let anyone judge you i was going to na but gave me anxiety had friend that went i was put on adderal and she look down on me i thought she is not in my head and blew her off,0
i would suggest family counseling so she can understand from a professional that its a real illness and not just some attention seeking behavior trust me if we could control it we sure as hell would meds can helpsome dont but it takes more than getting outside the best advice is focus on getting better and not how people;even family perceive your disorder you can only do what you can each day put one foot in front of the other and take a step forward no matter how small remember you are not alone there are many of us who suffer in silence and shame im learning to become okay with being myself ((hugs)),0
honestly in my experience you can educate people but you cant force them to accept that knowledge or not either they will try to understand or they wont and if they wont dont stress yourself out over it because thats not your fault you can only ask that they respect your boundaries and not discuss it because its an upsetting or triggering topic the old adage is true you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink,0
i know this feeling so well my dad does kind of the same thing i know a lot of it is from the generation he was raised in and the lack of mental awareness to the general population then and now i have coworkers friends family who also just dont understand it can be very hurtful at times or even down right embarrassing for me to try and explain but i know its not the fact that they wont understand its just that they cant how can they truly understand what im living with when theyve never had to deal with it themselves even other people with the same disorders can vary in functionality and how they feel about the disorder because of their own personal experiences and sometimes we dont understand that they cant and we just have to remember everyone is at different levels of understanding another and be able to be okay with that and know that it isnt our fault,0
im on lithium and anxiety meds too i have bipolar 1,1
hmmi doubt itll work in my case,1
oh yes it is fair i think she should walk the path of shame this time because sh denied her family once again for this kind of life and meher mom was the only one there for her 100% 24hr and he was off living in the streets not worrying about finding a place for her to go to or supporting her to stay clean just bringing her back down after a year of soberity,0
erm how about telling her no fucking way!!! she chose this life she needs to deal with it she should have thought about that before she thought she was in the book 50 shades of grey & its not fair to confuse your little boys xxx,0
my thoughts exactly she said yesterday if she doesnt get some money soon shell be forced to move back to mine! like i want that stress! told her to speak to her parents,0
this is what i want i keep reading it and i have adhd this all seams so huge i get confused on how to do it all,0
i feel for you all my son has bipolar and i know his hard he struggles each dayxx,0
no you arent alone how about scheduling a lay around do nothing day? once it even twice a week rest take a break from the endless self battles and let the dishes sit no tidying up not even getting dressed on other days when you just hate everything tell yourself "i will take care of stuff today because thursday i can blow it all off no guilt" we gotta learn how to actually rest rather than crumple under the pressure we put on ourselves,0
im have so much depression and anxiety but i never take any meds :(,1
im sure many of us as children looked at other parents and thought they were far cooler than our own i guess its human nature to think the grass is always greener unfortunately mental illness isnt nice for any loved ones to deal with especially for a child to understand children unfortunately can be very selfish its not until a lot later that they learn to become selfless some unfortunately never learn but im sure thats not the case for you and your daughter im sure that however hard it is for her now she will learn to accept understand and as she matures im sure she will become a far more tolerant and caring person because of it as others have suggested im sure what she really means is that she wished you were better that you didnt have to suffer and that she didnt have to see you suffer im sure she loves you very much but it must be so hard for her to understand and comprehend why you cant get better we as sufferers dont often understand it because it usually doesnt make sense so how can a child? children can at times be insensitive and hurtful but it can simply be because they dont have the maturity or insight to know otherwise im sure you have come across many adults who can be far more intolerant and insensitive my husband didnt get it but then again i dont think he wanted to your daughter is a young girl she has an excuse bless her im sure its not easy for you im sure probably another day she will completely forget that flippant remark and tell you how much she loves you you are doing all the right things to get better try not to dwell on this xx,0
hey there accept the help of family and friends they love you find out from your doctor about finding a support program for women in your situation be vocal about any scary thoughts that come up the baby growing inside of you is a blessing,0
i battled with on a daily basis i dont take meds even tho i do be needed it at times but somehow i managed this monster thats inside of me yea i finds myself crying a lot and dont even know why i shake it off of me and keep a pushing ,1
youll struggle n it will drive you crazy some times but if you keep it itll be the best thing uve ever had they will love you n you will love them but its up to you but stay strong n dont let anyone push you either way n as for the father if he doesnt want to help he doesnt know what his missing stay strong bub,0
your feelings are valid having a child can be overwhelming and scary even with help from the father and medication if you decide to keep the baby there will be challenges no matter what it can also rewarding in ways you cant imagine pregnancy is different for everyone however i cried all the time even for happy things i worried about everything i thought i was incapable of being a good mom i never asked for help either 6 years later i still have trouble asking for help even though my friends are more than willing i believe you can do this :) if you want to its also ok to look at adoption if you dont i personally dont think abortion is right but it is also an option if the baby isnt too far along im not here to judge no matter what you choose you must do what is right for you and you need to take care of yourself i did take an antidepressant during pregnancy and went to a therapist actually i still do both hiding all this only causes you to suffer more when i started therapy and started being open with my friends and family i found that several of them also had depression and anxiety and also needed help or emotional support as mothers not all of them but a good chunk all of a sudden i realized i had an entire support system right in front of me,1
if you have never officially been diagnosed with depression or anxiety i am guessing that means you have never been given therapy or medication to help? please please please get to a doctor asap and tell them how you are feeling pregnancy hormones definitely intensify emotions and you can get much needed help from a good doctor if the first doctor doesnt help or doesnt take you seriously go to another and another until you find one who does your life and your childs life are valuable,1
i feel for you so much can you not go to your doc or speak to a midwife i suffer too and when i was having my baby felt the same wayi managed to open up about this to my midwife and she noted everything down in my notes they kept a really good check on me right through my pregnancy once i give birth they put me on medication straight away please open up its nothing to be ashamed about you would be surprised the amount of people and new mothers out there that feel the same way also once my child was born and put in my arms the love you will have will surprise you it will be hard but there is a lot off support out there please open up and talk to someone god bless you x x,0
honestly you are not being dramatic about it your feelings are real you dont have to continue suffering like this there is help for you i know its real hard to ask for it when you are independent i suffered for years without any help from anyone and it got so bad i just had to say something i was on a mood stabiliser and anti depressant before my pregnancy and they were both taken away for the first 12 weeks and then i was allowed my mood stabiliser after 12 weeks but not the anti depressant please see a doctor they will prescribe something to you if the benefits of medication outweigh the cons you really do need to be monitored to make sure you arent going to get any worse and im high risk post natal depression if you talk to your family they can keep an eye on you after the baby is born a doctor can refer you to counselling too you may find it easier to talk about how you really feel with a stranger i wish you all the luck xx,1
you can do this being pregnant intensifys every thing emotionally ect your scared because it sounds the father of the baby is no support to you find the people who care an love you an talk to them its scary being a first time mother but your child is a blessing an you child can change you entire world for the better keep your head up,0
im sure that must often be the case with mental illness be it anxiety or depression or other illnesses it is really good that you can take note of the signs and use them as a warning i think people who are in a period of recovery and have learnt how to notice signs of decline triggers if you like and can then engage preventative measures to make sure you dont continue to spiral downwards but this might only be possible for people who have spent years and months working thorough all of this im trying to remember all the physical symptoms i remember of severe depression i constantly had this almost sore throat it wasnt sore but i was always aware of this unpleasant sensation a tightness all to do with the anxiety of feeling depressed and not being able to escape the nausea tightness in my chest unsettled stomach lethargy no appetite some of these things you could almost argue were not actually physical but psychological but felt physicalweird! the first time i had a panic attack i honestly thought i was having a heart attack and im no way a drama queen or a hypochondriac! yes whether it be a mental physical symptom they can be so closely linked and often chicken and egg one can lead to another and vice versa but yes i think stress in general can cause so many physical symptoms most very unpleasant thats why alone its so important to look after yourselves eat well sit in the sunshine and to do some light exercise if you can xx,0
omg u hit the nail on the head and ive noticed about three days before full moon my anxiety over whelming and im depression bad x,0

i am working on my masters in art therapy and i really would like to treat people without medicating them i dont think that should be the first go to option i have anxiety bp1 and ptsd medication has never worked for me art has just a thought,1
lesson number one never tell employer your mental illness they will capitalize on it  like they did mocking your illness by saying its too stressful trust me  let them know your doctor gave you time off for medical reasons but thats it,0
ive been diagnosed with both bipolar 1 & 2 i have mixed manic episodes i have struggled with the depression part of it for years & was relatively oblivious to being manic because its the closest to "normal" ive been able to feel i only recognize the symptoms now since ive been diagnosed & educated about this debilitating disorder beforehand i just thought i was extremely depressed i can relate to what youre going through i remember many days of not being able to get out of bed to shower or get dressed all i felt like doing was cry & sleep i couldnt eat & having to interact with another human being was a living nightmare i tried many different medications until i finally found one that made a difference not all medications affect people in the same way so its important to work with a mental health physician to figure out what works best for you im not gonna say medication is a fix all but it definitely does decrease symptoms & make life more bearable & worth living again getting enough rest is also just as equally important sometimes during a manic episode sleep may seem impossible & there are medications available to help with that but personally i choose melatonin which is all natural above all just try your best to stay positive & on your worst days remind yourself " this too shall pass!" a good support group or just one person you can trust & talk to when youre having a low also benefits greatly hope this helps encourage you to keep pushing forward ,0
i have experienced this psychotic depression and it seems so real but you have to remember its sleep depravation best thing i did was get on to you tube and look at guided meditation for insomnia anxiety depression etc there are loads or sleep depravation and then go and make yourself comfy choose jason stephenson or the honest guys and listen to them and do the breathing you will find over time you will fall asleep at the beginning of the meditation and gradually catch up on your sleep but if you consider self harm then you must dial 911 or suicide prevention or the samaritans tomorrow is another day and things can get easier i no longer have conversations with animated trees they are just trees but at the time they were my very real pals remember it is a chemical imbalance we have often caused by burnout and exhaustion it screws up the seratonin and it takes time to recover but you can you really can,1
lack of sleep alone afterabot 70 hours can make you psychotic are you eating anything? drug induced sleep is an ok alternative for a while but i recently also had a sa and a loved one odd on mixing the scripts with the alcohol he was so desperate i would like to see you go get evaluated for an inpatient stay be safe get rest get on a schedule of sorts mine has been off for four or five years days without sleep then a week in bed no self care its a spiral please i care no one deserves to handle this alone no one derves this period go take some positive action go get help while you are still scared and motivated it can get better our mentlissues wax and wane take a chanc3 on the positive youve endured enough crap for now,0
hi there the shadow figure is looking after you dont be scared  is there anyone who could stay with you  a nice drink of milk and honey might help xxx,1
i have had a long history with major depressive disorder multiple anxiety disorders and ptsd i also have chronic insomnia i understand how difficult it is to just lay there and not being able to sleep i did try sleeping pills but they made me so spaced out to the point where i couldnt hold a conversation im now on amitriptyline which has a sedative in which helps me get off to sleep the majority of the time keep going and trust the professionals i know that itll be difficult to get back on track but over time youll get there :) hope this helps :),1
please seek out a professional who knows more than wikipedia bullet points too many so called ptsd experts know absolutely nothing my closest attempt was one year ago on the 15th of this month instead i was involuntarily committed for 2 weeks had they took my history of managable panic attackt that happened on occasion caused by emotional abuse growing up constant bullying ems for 6 years which gives me constant flashbacks and nightmares due to a lot of horiffic stuff long story short had the hospital given me a brain scan they would have found ms and not given me a medication the month before that will make current symptoms a ton worse and how i had just realized recently? i was coming to terms with being a 6 year victim of sociopathic abuse they should have realized my ptsd was complex ptsd and i had my first ms attack because of those and other contributing factors my advice from experience is please get help immediately and make sure the dr knows more about ptsd than you do please take care of yourself you are more important to yourself than you realize and there are people who care deeply about you,1
melatonin is available over the counter at any pharmacy and helps me sleep i also "see things" at times and its terrifying sounds like you need some medication to help you shake off all the shitty feelings sending you strength,1
google "night terrors" or "sleep paralysis" and you should find a pretty good explanation of the situation its not that uncommon and sometimes just knowing what it is makes it easier to deal with,1
you have anxiety so bad sweetie! dont worry about those shadowy figures they cant hurt you only scare you thats what they want remember that has your doc ever prescribed you any anti anxiety meds? just tell those shadows to beat it you have more power than they do as a member of the living,1
i take a antihistamine called promethazine or phenergan as its known i take it to sleep and was told they not addictive or can be taken to od  hope you manage to find help like shannon said we here if you need to talk ive been through so much and still struggle  x,1
i also take 25mg of phenergan at night paula but i am worried about weight gaindoes it cause it though?,1
excellent medication i got really tired and drowsy in the first few weeks but wow no anxiety any more,1
if you start lactating dont be alarmed risperdol does that,1
risperidone has worked well for me i have been taking it primarily for anxiety 1 mg per day it definitely has made a difference i have not experienced weight gain but i have a lot of experience with meds so i know how to manage the hunger side-effects,1
latuda had better results but the cost is prohibitive with my insurance and with a strong family history of heart problems the fact that it increases cholesterol worried me and my doctor it also regulated my sleep schedule for the first time in my life im on 300mg of lamictal right now and it doesnt seem to be going much,1
lamictal!!!! latuda made me a horrible person,0
i had a horrible experience in every way on latuda but i dont know of it affects other people that badly i did like lamictol,0
i like lamictal latituda did not work for me and you dont have to worry about the food thing,1
im all ears for you i know recently ive been nothing but scared of myself im bipolar unmediated! im anytime!,0

i agree if you think you might need to go than its time i just got out of the hospital and i can honestly say i was way more scared of what i might do than going into the hospital,0

i was on propranolo for my anxiety and worked well was on it for a year and now been off it for couple of months  depression wise im on mertazipine and quitiapine and just had a relapses over the last week so been signed of work for a few weeks but hope to get back there as soon as i can  every person is different so its what works best for you ,1
i take propranolol for both anxiety and severe heart palpitations it doesnt help with my anxiety at all but it works amazing for my heart palpitations!,1
depression anxiety disorder ptsd,1
dang in the us they dont give disability to recently diagnosed mental illness you have to show a long history of it disrupting your life after diagnosed with that being said i have generalized anxiety disorder ibs adhd and depression it takes a while to get the right combination of medication to work if the anxiety becomes controlled them the ibs becomes controlled with fewer ibs episodes which also can be controlled by treating the symptoms working helps a lot with anxiety so dont give up on ithope you feel better soon,1
it takes work but you can beat it and live a normal life my daughter is 18 and has anxiety depression and ibs and she wasnt diagnosed until she was 15 after her daddy committed suicide she is doing good in college works full time it took her time to get the right combination after meds what im saying is dont give up hope or loose your dreams because you can overcome this it is possible,1
ive had the anxiety and depression since i was 12 but they couldnt give me any medication because i was under 16,1
im on esa i chose not to apply for pip just adds more anxiety propronol is helping me lots although i look more bloated put on weight but at a size 10 normally this is a good side affect i ran out and went a few days without them i got hot flushes nausea and panic attacks so make sure once on them dont miss daysx,0
pip is not for mental health i get it due to my severe arthritis they ent bothered about mental health esa i also get for severe anxiety and depression but pip wont touch you,1
mate honestly you need to stay busyive been treated for bipolar for 20 yearsthrough the good and the bad i stayed employednow ive got a reasonably successful careera family friendsbut you have to work for it nothings freeand ive got no doubt that to much time alone with your thoughts only ends in sadness,0
i had a job when i was 18 and decided to go to school full time i crashed hard after about a week of doing both needless to say i quit both but found other things to occupy my time i volunteered at my youth group then got a very part time job nannying two girls i did that for 3 years so no shame doin what you gotta do,0
i too have depression ptsd severe anxiety i too can not work i tried for many years in many types of jobs and the end result always the same severe breakdown everyone handles thiers differently and it saddens me to see that a group i look forward to reading everyday has members that devalue what someone is going thru emma im so sorry you are experiancing this at such a young age do not take any stake in people trying to lessen how you feel or what you go thru daily you are a survivor! you go girl survive do your thingsafe and happy travels,0
propananol really help with anxiety for me they calm me as for pip ha ha im able to wash so they dont care bout anything else im lost in my sad little life the system is a disgrace im 49 honey been dealing with this all my life and fighting for helpwaste of time x,0
i have ptsd depression anxiety and a handful of other mental illnesses also have scoliosis and a fcked up spine i get up every day take care of a 5&2 yr old plus go to work its all abt gettin out there n doin it bc u have to n not living off the govt they wont give u disability for a mental illness not unless ur brain dead or are mentally handicapped thats jst how disability works if u can walk talk then u can wrk the govt doesnt see mental illnesses as a disability,1
i work nights cus i cant deal with social situations i have bipolar anxiety complex ptsd and depression and the only thing that keeps me same and gives me a purpose is going to work,1
i have no answer for you but i would like to say that anyone who trys to devalue you and what you are going through are irrelevant ignore them do not let them make you feel bad i know how hard it can get i have my own struggles and it is so hard to work full time while suffering if you need to do this and your are seeking help them good for you do what you need to do to take care of yourself and please do not let anyone who tries to devalue your experience succeed it just show their lack of empathy and character my heart goes out to you and i wish you the best you are worth healing you are worth loving and you are valid,0
i took buspar and propanol they did nothing for my bad anxiety ,1
i think its a worry that if you start on it now you may never be off of it most mean well but you also need to remember different age groups and countries hold different values and are expressed as such i will say finding work that you enjoy in a business you are comfortable in as well as a company that is understanding helps alot with the anxiety at work if you know people will understand and be caring and considerate does help i also know thats very hard to find,1
im so upset that they believe that i should just go to work because im an adult and im 18 amy ricker,0
youre welcome! its a hard life to live with those illnesses and as someone who has depression and anxiety as well i know the hard fight it can be if you were 21 and your state was one of the ones that does medical marijuana id suggest that it has made a positive change for the better in my life and with so many low thc options it doesnt feel like your high as a kite,0
good luck with pip ive got severe anxiety depression and epilepsy and got rejected ,1
emma-jane naude i think i will try again with the doctors help as you are i feel so stupid asking them i feel anxious about the doctor laughing in my face and telling me i wouldnt deserve it or something ive worked all my life and want to continue working but have been signed off sick for 6 months now and my job is hanging in the balance the safety net of pip would take such a big weight off my shoulders,0
my daughter is on propranol she is at university she has been complaining off chest pain and numbness and irregular heartbeat i worry in case its not the tablets as she was a premature baby she wont go to the doctors it was hard enough getting her to go about her low mood and anxietyand to be honest it really has not helped her i hope you feel better soon big hugs x x x,1
citalopram and its sister tablet escitalopram are not as severe as most of the other ssris out there in particular sertraline (lustral) seroxat (paroxetine / paxil) and anafranil citalopram takes the edge off the issue and the anxiety / panic but it still allows you to function normally sertraline and seroxat can also cause libido problems in men and women,1
propranolol is fab - it saved my life simple it just stops my blood pressure rising which prevents my anxiety from getting out of control  it just  stops its like flicking a switch  bliss i take one every morning and it gets rid of  conservatively speaking - at least half my anxiety symptoms on a normal day i experience almost no noticeable symptoms whatsoever of course some days are more stressful than others and some situations are more stressful than others - so if i know i am going somewhere that im not going to like very much then a very low dose of diazepam takes care of most of the other symptoms i can work i can play i can have a life i teach  i can stand up in front of a class  when i was at my worst i could barely leave the house propranolol brought me back im a fan[caveat: my anxiety is related to the bp2 and combat-related ptsd so advice may vary according to circumstances however the propranolol helps nicely with the hypomania from the bp2 *and* the hyper-vigilance of the ptsd],1
i got rejected and wish i had never applied i became very anxious during the application and assessment period one of the reasons i given was that ihad a good understanding of my illness i have bpd no shit sherlock ive had to live with this for 12 years of course i have researched and read about my illness,0
irritable bowel syndrome,0
i have depression severe anxiety and ptsd been diagnosed with all three for well over a decade and i still get up every morning mon-fri to go to work why?? because thats what adults do you ought to try to find a job that fits you rather than decide at 18 that youll spend the rest of your life of disability im not trying to be mean when i say this but damn dont let the disease define you!!,0
i think thats a hiif idea the way the other comment was said didnt sound like a nice suggestion people can only do so much without being overwhelmed easing into things is the better way if a person can,0
i have suggested to somebody i know who has ocd anxiety and depression to try volunteering in a shop for either mind bhf pdsa the red cross etc just for the social element and for the experience of work in the hope that one day maybe they could use whichever skills they have gained in volunteering and apply for a paid job be it part-time or otherwise this would give them something to look forward to and hopefully help them build up their self-esteem in the long run having a volunteer job to begin with is a good start and it would not affect the benefit claims i tried to explain all this to the persons mother but she did not approve i really dont know why when it would serve as a constructive purpose and none of the benefits would be harmed in fact the dwp / employment centre / local council would applaud the effort in trying to do something positive,1
i was going to try for disability until my lawyer said it was a 17 month waiting period and an additional 6 months just to get a decision thats over 2 years of waiting um no thank you i would rather work than be broke and loose every thing work is difficult with bp and anxiety i understand that but its not impossible its just finding a job that you can do that fits you,1
like many have already said everyones circumstances are different and we should not judge it is difficult to work if you are constantly having panic attacks cant focus on tasks or on what your boss is saying freezing up when people speak to you etc disability may or may not be a permanent thing but age is not always an indicator of how "ready" or capable someone is of working also with age can come an understanding and growth of coping mechanisms and medication adjustments that could lead to being able to work someday but she needs money in the meantime yeah? just saying just because shes young doesnt mean she is more capable of overcoming her disability and in this case it may actually work against her i do agree she should not give up hope of working someday but acting like she is immature because she struggles with debilitating mental illness is very condescending and shows a lack of empathy and understanding that not everyone is like you and just because you have/had it bad doesnt mean there isnt someone who has it worse,1
i used to work full time but i had to change to part time because i was so mentally exhausted and was having panic attacks as soon as i clocked out i took 2 weeks off of work to rest you know whats best for you like you said everyone is different maybe you could try volunteer work when you start to feel better,1
i also work nights because i cant work with the public nor a lot of co workers and though i still have lots of anxiety and feel at times i wanna pass out or hide i try to collect myself and keep going! i have had my illnesses since i was 12 also and i am now 45 so we walk in different shoes but have some similar experiences!,1
ive been diagnosed with literally the same exact things plus panic disorder and was on disability since i was 16 but i lost my disability at age 21 and went almost 4 years without it or even a job because i believed the same thing when you have severe social anxiety and panic attacks randomly you already know theres no way id want to be around hella people and feel so miserable but on the inside im also passionate about living life and having awesome fun precious moments with friends and family and i want what my friends have; a life a life where youre exhausted but because of work not my disability i want to feel stress the kind about college not how im going to survive mentally and physically today or how im going to ask mom for money to pay my phone bill im missing out and ill be 25 on september 2nd im a strong person i just havent tried hard enough which hurts kinda of to say because i believe i do try i try every damn day to wake up and be ok but most of the time my demons stop me and get the best of me but the last 5 months something clicked in april i lost my medical insurance and ive been going all this time without my pills i was on trazadone lamotrigine propranolol etc but ive been staying with my bfs mom and shes been such great help and i realized with a change of environment (for me in my own case not suggesting this works for everyone) ive changed completely a friend is helping me get a part time job and i couldnt be happier or more proud of myself for facing my fears the point of this long comment is that i wish i did what im trying to do now when i was your age because im getting older and now its gonna take me longer to be who i want to be dont make my mistake ive seen people with worst cases of paranoia schizophrenia and be amazing successful people speaking in front of crowds and hallucinating at the same time but pushing it to the side to be able to do their job and youd never guess you can work with ptsd anxiety etc is it going to be easy? no are you gonna mess up have an episode maybe even lose your job? yeah tbh but you get up take care of yourself first and try again i hope you see this as helpful and not judging or a negative comment because i promise its not sorry for long comment lol emma-jane naude,0
im on permanent disability now after almost 30 years of driving myself into the ground however i have very severe bipolar bpd major anixety and panic disorder ptsd not saying you shouldnt apply for it but here in canada generally for just anxiety and ptsd they wouldnt quailfy you for permanent disability just ppwd which is given for 2 years to help get your self ready for the world due to the severe trauma i suffered growing up and everything that happened and numerous suicide attempts and fighting for help i got a new doc who immediately saw how much i was suffering and got me on disability i also have a now 8 year old son whom i help raise with my inlaws due to the severity of my illnesses i would suggest starting with therapy maybe doing a job few days a week and finding other ways to help you not saying you dont quailfy for aid but your still very young and you may have a hard time being accepted for such funding however like the one lady said every one is different i wish you the best,1
bonnie corbin what you said to her is absolutely horrible no two people have the history or personal level of any mental disorder and too suggest otherwise only shows that you truly know nothing or truly dont understand mental illness to say what you insinuated on this page is horrible,0
i work nights cus i cant deal with social situations i have bipolar anxiety complex ptsd and depression and the only thing that keeps me same and gives me a purpose is going to work,1
ive been working as a therapist for 10 years theres only 11 disorders i regularly treat yet no 2 clients are ever the same there are massively differing severities of the same condition ranging from functional when the person can work well to the other extreme where hospitalisation is needed there are times when i tell a client to keep working because the routine is good for their depression or the anxiety is manageable with support and avoidance would worsen the anxiety however there are also times when i would encourage someone to remove stresses like work from their lives so they can focus on getting good at managing the basics lots of people have the same diagnosis but treatment and advice will vary for the individual pip application is difficult if you are able to get an advocate or advice from cab it may assist you in navigating the process best wishes to you emma-jane naude,1
izzie radford-nash - saying everyone here has mental illness so we understand your situation is completely untrue and destructive to say my ptsd anxiety depression etc experience is not identical to emma-janes or anyone elses nor are theirs identitcal to each other so yes you have some glimmer of insight into others lives with the same condition but just because you fight similar demons doesnt mean you understand theirs,0
i have severe depression and anxiety and just turned 19 i have a job and do so agree with bonnie,1
emma-jane i have dealt with aniexty and depression for years i got married and then had a baby at 19 thats when the depression hit hardest when my son was about 2 i got pregnant again still felt the same way when my middle was about 3 i took floral classes just to get out of the house best decision i ever made working with flowers for me is calming 3 years ago my teacher hired me to work at her flower shop i look forward to going to work because its a stress reliever maybe doing something that sounds fun to do or taking an art class in an adult school will help im 34 now and i still have aniexty and depression but its getting better just find something that looks like fun it could be hiking arts and crafts etc good luck!,1
i in now way shape or form devalued her situation or judged her experience i told her that there are ways of living with anxiety and not to give up you dont have to be a victim i think its absolutely absurd that doctors are so quick to tell a young woman who has just admitted shes never even been to therapy that she should just give up on working and go on disability because she has anxiety am i the only one who sees the ridiculousness in this?!? her anxiety will only increase if she gives in to it and deciding not to work before even going through therapy is just ludicrous to me,0
i found working helped me i had to cope through anxiety attacks in a "safe" environment gaining more confidence and success in dealing with the disorder helps you to manage it better long term ive taken two tours of europe been to mexico and many other trips doing things i never thought i would do anxiety is uncomfortable but it isnt dangerous is what i tell myself also rewired my thinking by studying buddhism in particular ajahn brahms book "dont worry be grumpy" worked better than any kind of medication,1
ive had this since i was 12 both the anxiety and depression this hasnt been an easy decision for me i dont want to give up but even if i go on pip for a few years until im mentally stable and ready for work then i will but for now its what i believe is best i am waiting to get an appointment for a counsellor but not heard anything back,0
you have so much life to live there are so many different treatments and things you could be doing to help cope with the anxiety im honestly appalled the doctor would suggest it  have you seen a psychiatrist?,0
im so sorry to hear that and i wish that i could give you some hope i have a congenital heart defect which was only found when i was 19 years old (told i was just a lazy unsociable child) had some side effects with that (low blood pressure blackouts depression) but had 1st pacemaker after the birth of my eldest child now (lots of years later) jan-april 2016 had 4 pacemaker ops due to complications; have been treated for depression anxiety sociophobia & insomnia since my husbands death 6 years ago and had to give up a lifetime job which i loved pip was stopped in february causing many problems cab has been extraordinarily helpful in appealing and re-appealing but say even if its good news ill hear nothing until october i feel guilty still knowing that this is being done to people who are dying and im lucky but it sucks good luck to you and please get a support worker or go to citizens advice bureau! *(( hug ))*,0
i stopped taking propanolol because i didnt feel that much of a difference when on it i still had anxiety attacks and it wasnt helping much for working it may work for you though everyone reacts differently to different medications all it did for me was slow my heart rate down a bit,1
me too it stopped the shakes and heart racing at first but i found it didnt work as well later on it doesnt do anything for the brain whir ive been told now to just take it as needed,1
i find the propananolol helps with the heart palps i have with my anxiety,1
propanolol is a bp med often used for anxiety by helping to keep your bp low usually you need more of a dx to qualify for any assistance ,1
my neurologist wouldnt prescribe propranolol to me as a migraine preventative because it can cause a low mood/depression i have major depressive disorder and anxiety,1
i had this for my anxiety got taken off it due to pregnancy gone from fairly functioning human being to not being able to leave the house most days  i have agoraphobia without it panic attacks at the thought of being around people i cant sleep properly without it as my anxiety keeps me awake pregabalin honestly changed my life,1
it caused me all sorts of problems i had drug induced narcolepsy and dementia! it really really didnt agree with me i sat in a meeting for a hour and panicked 2 days later thinking id missed it! my partner was with me as said i fell asleep 4 times and kept forgetting what i was talking about!! then i scored 0 on my pip what a joke!!!!!,0
i have propanolol for anxiety,1
i would recommend it for anxiety i cant manage without it,1
pregabalin is a very hit and miss drug and i consider it still largly experimental in all fields because there havent been many tests done on it (compared to most drugs) it was designed for neuropathic pain it works somewhat for most anxiety not completely and is addictive despite "expert opinion" i had to ween off it because i got addicted with side effects like euphoria and weight gain to answer the questiom though yes you will likely gain a lot of weight most people do because it slows nerve transmission eventually slowing metabolism,1
i haventcant and wont let this beat me down!!!!i struggle everyday ,0
stigma is the biggest global social issue and hiv is one of the biggest global health issue stigma affects race religion culture health status etc and we fall into one category hiv we are either hiv negative or positive my self and my team member from around the globe are working on creating the app that will help in curbing this problem for millions or maybe billions of people around the globe think you care so much about seeing a change in the world we need someone from this group we can talk to about depression and anxiety so help us tackle this problem better im also one but i need someone elses accessment,1
seeing as how my job is developing technology i fear this day,0
it is so sad that you have been let down by your employer when you originally thought she would be supportive im sure that has not helped you at all im hoping your doctor is helping you and you can visit again if you need to has he prescribed any medication to help? if you are in the us i dont know the rules on employment it doesnt seem right that she is pressurising you to leave only you can decide on what to do whether the job is right for you with mental illness we can blame ourselves and feel guilty its really not your fault you didnt choose to be like this yes emotions can be all over the place it certainly can be dreadful sometimes i hope you have people to help and support you lean on them xx,1
yeah you kinda put yourself in a corner saying you want a job that is not so stressful i would start looking for one that is not as stressful and you will feel so much reilf i had a bad job i would cry before and cry after i am disabled and had a special paper filled out they couldnt fire me but i got a lot of shit and when the project closed and i didnt have the job i was amazed how great it was not having stress now i have a job that is so mellow i love it i wish you well and hope you find whats best for you,0
i know its horrible isnt it but we are stronger than people think we get up and do it where some wouldnt when they dint even have our problem remember we are strong and better than everyone else!!  x,0
thank you susan i have to be back on monday and already stressing,0
dont ever feel guilty a job is a job your health is more important sounds to me she is not as supportive as she said she would be maybe some time off wont hurt a new job a new start may help i feel you i feel trapped i feel too scared to try and move on so i continue to go to work unhappy i wish i could do what im advising you to do,0
im the same but frightened to change and worried that everything might go wrong i dont do change very well im a creatures of habit and change scares me maybe part of my anxiety we have so many barriers to try and cross because of our illness but we should give ourselves a pat on the back because we actually get up and go to work its such a hard thing to do for us but we do it ive tried looking for other work but when i see the application form my mind goes blank and i have no idea what they are wanting me to say i talk myself out of it then and think im not good enough for anything else hopefully one day day we have the strength to make the change good luck x,0
it is genetic in our family my sister got it if you could make it past the age of 29 and not get it then you would not i was worried till 30 i have a list of other problems i just didnt want that one to hopefully there will be betterb medication if the gen pops up in my great grand childrens lives,0
im wondering what are their reasons for not believing u thats gotta be really hurtful and hard to deal with you should be very proud of yourself for having made it this far without their support you are very strong for that as for advice candace couldnt have said it any better but i have a feeling something will happen to open their eyes when you are patient and focus on bettering yourself instead of stressing and fighting everything else usually tends to fall in to place good luck i hope it works out for u,0
you have to let it go none of us are perfect and dealing with bipolar or any mental issue is such a struggle people that dont have the daily struggle have no idea how hard it can be for us im happy that you have finally found medications to help because sometimes i could take a lifetime but when you find that moment or you feel like yourself its precious dont ever let anybody else diminish your shining light,0
im going through something similar n just reading through the comments has made me feel a little less guilty abt cutting people off being part of this group has saved me many times thanku ,0
yes people dont understand my family has a problem of everytime i get mad or upset its cause im mentally ill i hate it but i have to step back and keep telling myself they just dont like to be accountable for thier actions and i know its not me cause i can tell the difference when im manic and just pissed,0
if you have tried every way you can think of to inform this person of what your condition is about (i find the memes and such can be an easy and helpful way to explain things sometimes) and they just refuse to understand or believe you then to me they would be toxic and i would remove them from my life if down the road they have educated themselves and want to be a positive impact on my life i would start out slowly rebuilding that relationship i have lost a lot of "friends" and most of my family because they dont believe what bipolar disorder/depression and anxiety are it is my opinion that those who truly love and care for you will make the effort to learn about the condition how to treat you and support you with your condition just as they would with anybody that has an invisible condition like heart disease lung disease etc having a "broken brain" as i call it is serious and you dont need toxic people in your life life is too short and being stable is a hard place to get to you want to enjoy being stable and having a life again you cant do that with toxic people in your life just my opinion,0
as long as you are feeling more stable on your meds try not to worry about what other people say or think your are more important it is hard enough coping without their negative input stay strong and keep looking forward ,0
ive said this a thousand times before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor youll never understand the way the person feels ive lost so many sooo many ppl in my life cuz of my disorders over time my heart has hardened although i try to love n connect with ppl you cant see it so to some it isnt real or a cop out nobody wants this or asks for this you have to be you n if they cant except you for you then you dont need them as much as it hurts you have to put yourself first be open n honest n blunt tell them how you feel n if they cant respect that then you need to move on never be ashamed of who you are n have the strength to stand up for yourself there are plenty of ppl who will support you n remember you are not alone hope this helps n although we dont know ea ch other i am allways here for those who struggle with mental illness,0
someone whos never been there will never empathize let alone be compassionate about your case (unless they have the kind of golden heart that allows them to -somewhat- sympathize with you) it might be hard at first but you should distance yourself from anything or anyone that makes you feel angry sad or guilty these 3 emotions at higher degrees are the gateway to depression you need to find people that have been there and overcame it or learned to cope interacting with others even online in a fb group is a good start id say :) also this :,0
dont worry about them some people you can never please focus on you!❤,0
it is completely her issue either shut up and move on or leave jeez have some empathy for her shes clearly struggling if not then gtfo,0
you can only do so much for someone before you finally throw your hands in the air it may be difficult more so because they are married but i can only imagine her stress to take all this on plus their unstable son eventually she has one option at the end of the road which is to take care of their son and herself as he wont do it with her might sound cold but ive been there with guys who are unsavable i havent been married but as a woman struggling with bipolar and depression i had to walk away there wasnt much more i could do for them i had to take care of myself before i hit rock bottom with them,1
i have a sister who does not live a healthy productive lifeshe does not want to take medsget any kind of help and she cusses me daily after i just gave her foodcoffeecigswhat ever she needsand not even a thank youif i didnt give her cigsshe goes into a manic fit screaming and cursing i do have neighborsshe hoards and has completely junked up a trailori let her stay inshe wont work at anythingalthough she went to nursing school to be a r nshe has bipolar schizophrenia and recently got in trouble i have to pay her fineshe put in the paper that she was not indigent but in realityshe doesnt have a pennie i cant claim her on taxeswe pay her bills i dont want to see her out in a ditchbut shes bringing me down with hershe has no conciousand i have never seen her cry she sees dog peopleand talks to people not therei dont deserve this stress no one will help mental illness people,0
i have a couple of easy suggestions that i was able to do that helped tremendously in regards to your ged try to find a free short class to help you pass your ged; they have them all over probably even online these days or go to your local public library and study theyre book for geds i think you might have to do it there but not sure and take the get practice tests to see if there is anything on each one that you need to study or learn then take the practice tests again before you go to take each ged test that way you get rid of any doubt or anxiety and save yourself some time then go for it it looks to me like you can do this so good luck with the new job when you get one,1
whipps cross declared inadequate,0
k-mart! oh the horror! ,0
dont worry hes not the craigslist killer,0
big bag of nope i dont wanna know my insecurities are bad enough and to hear the negative thoughts regularly? even when paired with the good it would be too much for me no no no no no no,0
never a doubt,0
no thats part of my paranoia,0
i think deep down many of us afflicted already know we are the gifted allowed to access parts of our brains housing telepathy and other 6th sense awareness capabilities and that is why many of us war with depression and anxiety we share in the glory and agony of others who have the luxury of only being aware of themselves our true design and purpose in a less increasingly and overwhelmingly selfish world is to help others understand themselves and how their "vibes" are affecting the world around them,1
i think ur manic episode might have come on cause ur worried what might happen during that period ur waiting for ur meds just thinking ,1
every time i came off of seroquel with the permission of my psychiatrist i felt like i had a horrible case of the flu now the first time another psychiatrist that should not be practicing took me off 400mg in two weeks and i went into a mixed episode one of the worst experiences ive gone through i was on medical leave for three months the other two times it was a gradual decrease and i did not experience mania or mixed this is just my experience though,0
your going through withdrawal i take 400 and as it is i will be needing mine to be raised 4 its not working any longer i have been on 400 mg since the age of 15 i am now 28 missing one dose causes automatic withdrawal of shaking and nausea your best bet while ur waiting is to go to the emergency room and get a prescription from them until ur doctor can give u one thats what i do when i run out,1
you might feel like total shit! i felt like i was withdrawling nausea upset stomach irrirable etc i try to keep a few as back up from each script because i am terrified of those feelingsugh seroquel can be brutal going on and coming off circumstantially or not i have taken benedryl to get a few hours of fitful "sleep",0
how about when youre lose your job in law enforcement due to ptsd bipolar 2 and social anxiety disorder that means no insurance no drs visits and cold turkey on meds wow the suicidal thoughts and nightmares just never end,1
i have severe separation anxiety depression bi polar ii and constant panic attacks not working trying to get ss have been on every med there is since the mid 80s nothing has really worked pretty much crippled by my mental issues cant get anything done or make any needed changes in my life i sometimes wonder when it will get to be too much to continue on i have no insurance any advice?,1
i am bipolar also with panic anxiety depressive disorder ive been in severe pain for many years i finally was diagnosed having fibromyalgia deep pain in upper and lower back shoulders and neck i have all 18 tender points maybe you can talk with ur dr about it! good luck to you,1
its such a struggle every day i take it minute by minute even reached out to this page for help i need so desperately and no-one responded hope that doesnt happen to other people that cry out it makes me feel alone all i do is pray god does answers prayers sometimes straight away sometimes in his time i just want all to know that you are not alone!!,0
i feel that every single day so frightening living alone thru those episodes i cant even go to the grocery store anymore perspiration drips from my face soaking my hair and clothes its that petrafying im told i have to fight thru it im becoming agoraphobic,0
been there dont except the thoughts as real data this is our bipolar mind look yourself in the mirror and see yourself for who you really are and tell yourself your a great pearson with friends that love your company and seeing is believing over time we train our brain to stop creating fiction in our minds it will always be there but it does not have to stain our hearts feelings and most importantly our souls with fiction at 40 years old im just learning this living as an alcoholic with bpd 2 and also learning just recently how to deal with oct ( obsessive compulsive thinking ) these thoughts haunted me for years today i only now have a freedom from the opinions of others that my mind creates no meds have helped me but hard work repetition and belief have givin me a whole new world of freedoms very grateful for good teachers and counsellors ,0
i have been in numerous psych units for attempted suicide my last od i was within 15 minutes of dying the last unit was the best thing that ever happened to me the vacation i was referring to is time away from all the problems from the "outside" the groups are so much help for one; you see that you arent the only one get suggestions on how to cope i have ptsd and bpd the structure of being on unit helps you regain some semblance of order lots of times i got a med adjustment there are lots of new meds from all the research mental and physiological i dont know why i am explaining myself for an obvious sarcasm sometimes humor is the only way coping with a stressful world,1
so true so very true anxiety really does suck being made fun of it sucks note,1
this is the most accurate description of anxiety ive ever read,1
this is so true the palpitations are so fast it feels like they want to jump out of your chest its very scary,0
why is the fear of rejection so paralyzing,0
yea my father was in the same situation and nobody had the courtesy to inform me of anything even when i called them! my calls were blockedtold sos: same old shit put downverbally assaulted and threatened more than once not to visit or call or even to show up idk what i did or why i am treated this way (besides having a mental illness and dehumanization societal norms are changing for the worse weddings graduations baby announcementsall computer generated the downward spiral of good manners and social interaction count me out,0
youre not wrong; that was an immediate natural reaction families are odd but maybe she wasnt disrespecting you but decided to inform everyone of all information in one go social media causes lots of issues between individuals perspective of use (im guilty of this :( ) also ive been in your shoes well done for showing so much love & care for your dad; i hope he improves quickly just bear in mind that this isnt the best time for family fallouts; that will only add to your stress and your dads healing be kind to yourself you cant refill someone else if you are empty (( <3 )),0
things get crazy when you have to get a parent admitted to the hospitalbe happy someone took over and it is just one more thing you didnt have to dogetting upset at your sister wont help anyonenow you have your dads room number etcso go on with todaybe grateful for what you havebe thankful your dad is being taken care ofis this about your feelings or your dads healthif it is bothpick your dads healththat is what is important for now,1
i think its always going to be upsetting when you read such personal info on fb before you have been updated its pretty rude but not worth your energy to completely flip out on your sister; you need all the energy you can muster just to deal with your life right now have a chat to hospital staff & see who is down as next of kin - is it you your sister or someone else? blessings,0
i should read all the comments 1st im sure there is some very good advice postedbut i would be very tempted to call/text/fb my sister & thank her for all she is doing to help take care of your father & let her know what a struggle youve had & how thankful you are that she has taken on the responsibility of his care & also mention any other siblings who should be able to help her as well,1
your sister is wrong but i went through stuff with my mother in law and realized i focused on the drama because the bigger picture terrified me you are absolutely right in being mad! things are hard take care of yourself and your kids first hang in there and vent to us you are not alone ,0
you have a right to be upset so vocalize ittell her it upset you not by yelling either and you would appreciate a phone call or text just to let you know whats going ondid you ever stop to think that maybe she didnt know what was going to happen before she left? i am a caregiverhave been since age 18i turn 50 this yearseen alot of miscommunication in hosp and nursing homes so it is very important to communicate with family over the care of your loved one,0
wow! im really sorry that just sucks id be upset too have you reached out to your sister yet? have you two always had problems? : (,0
you have every right to be upset i assume your sister was just visiting from out of town as much as i would i dont recommend flipping out on her but do leg it be know how you feel i also have a question why dont you have medical power of attorney over your father so if this happens again the hospital has to contact you,0
i am on propranalol as well for migraine prevention and it has done wonders for my anxiety! i had given up anxiety meds cuz they gave bad rebound anxiety the next day,1
luv you lacey louise taylorxox youll get it right hun please dont stress to much xx,1
its been 15 years since my diagnosis i have from time to time struggled with my past i have apologized to my family because i was horrible and they loved me anyway and got me help from time to time when im struggling i thank them again it helps me let go of those things idk if it will help you but i hope so,0
because nobody wants to deal with someone elses misery there is no kindness or compassion only selfishness,0
please call your dr asap please this has to be a horrible experience my best wishes to you,0
what the hell does this have to do with depression/bipolar/anxiety?,1
severe depression anxiety general and panic and bipolar depending on which doctor,1
i take wellbutrin with the cymbalta it helps with the anxiety but like most have said everyone is different it may be something to ask about,1
you may want to seek out a second opinion it may be medical causing everything to escalate i always has managable anxiety then last summer i experienced extremely high stress for no reason and out of control anxiety i was fatigued every waking moment coupled with all kinds of weird symptoms that made no sense a year later i now deal with a diagnosis of ms which increasea anxiety for no reason makes you tired and weak all the time have optic neuritis raynalds disease wilsons syndrome heat makes those and others magnified while i have always had anxiety now its a major part of ms i was diagnosed last fall at 40 it can happen at any age and heat with humidity makes attacks happen you may want to consider looking into an auto immune somehow its all related,1
try cbd oil it helped me so much no side affects i had no more pain anxiety or depression or side affects from the meds i went from tons of pills to no pills after using cbd,1

how can i avoid over thinking?,0
i allways over think n analyze everything too death im on six different medications n none of them help this problem for me personally i shut my mind off by smoking weed it helps with my mind n anxiety,1
breathe in for 5 seconds hold for 3 exhale for 4 thats the way i do it but that only helps calm anxiety and doesnt really help my thinking personally i drink a lot of whiskey and pop an opiate but i dont recommend that for anyone,1
i set an alarm on my phone,0
damn i wish that nobody had mental or emotional illnesses! i understand you guys! its so difficult to deal with bipolar disorder and with depression on a day to day basis! i just wish that nobody would suffer from that! its just horrible!,0
this is so true  we have no choice but to be strong  we have to fight to do the simplest things  we battle so much unimaginable pain  and hurt sadness and despair and sorrow its a stuggle just to deal with everything  its not for pussies thats for shure  ive been struggling for years  bout ready to give up  rather die then keep going,0
i lost weight on abilify i gained 150lbs on geodon zyprexa and seroquel over a 3 year period ( taking these meds at different times) my abilify dose goes from10 to 20 mg depending on time of year and other factors i have been on abilify now for 7 years i am much more functional now side effect wise i tend to get nauseous very easily as well as an upset stomach and intestinal issues which my pdoc said may be the abilify,1
abilify did absolutely nothing butbmake me worse i had no energy on it the hallucinations and paranoia got worse andso did the depression plus it caused me to have chest pains that were directly related to the medication being combined with another med i was only on it for 4 weeks but that was a miserable 4 weeks,1
i dont know some of my friends hallucinate and get paranoid and have done very well on it i just know it wasnt the med for me,0
ohh ok maybe it just isnt good for people that have that and paranoia,0
im on 15mg of abilify i have higher blood pressure and increased sweating and have gained half a stone in 3 months but its the best one ive had at stabilising me x,0
was on it for years gained over 50 lbs blood pressure increased needed more meds for that when blood sugar increased had to be taken off before i became diabetic,1
you will probably find mixed results my doc just put me on abilify because i couldnt get out of bed my energy level was 0 now i have only been on it less than a week but i can get out of bed now still low on energy but i am feeling it go up my doctor also knows i am worried about weight gain as i am 100 lbs over weight and have 5 blown out discs in my back i cant gain anymore or i will be at a loss she said for adult the older you are the more energy it will hopefully give you and shouldnt gain any weight the younger you are it will be just the opposite,0
my best mate is on abilify and he seems to be ok in the energy department; i mean he was probably tired for a while when they started him on it but currently he doesnt seem to have any energy issues related to medication (his schizophrenia and anxiety causes tiredness but his levels of tiredness are the same as prior to abilify),1
i think ive said this a thousand times before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor youll never understand the way the person feels somewhere along the line my heart has hardened although my family is supportive there are many who have left me for dead in their lives including my biological father nobody asks for this dont be ashamed of your tears you have every right to express your pain be blunt tell them exactly what they are doing n how it makes you feel if it continues you need to seek support somewhere else family should allways be there for you that being said respect yourself enough to get the support you deserve for the record i am bipolar 2 border line personality disorder and schizoaffective,0
dont feel guilty for your feelings its family they should embrace you as you are period,0
to have to struggle with myself so much you have to have a spine or grow nuts its a survival mechanism! its always one thing or another brave i have to be,0
sleep deprivation and to much sleep are common you have to just roll with it ! just understand ur not lazy and expect and accept that  dont beat yourself up ur already struggling they say you have to force yourself up i really have tried that and having a sun lamp helps take vitamind for u may be insufficient sounds like ur not going thru the rem phase of sleep rapid eye movement u think youve slept for eight hrs but when you wake you dont feel like youve slept at all,1
hell my meds change constantly if you do not understand why or how much of a medication you can call your provider and speak with their nurse or talk to your pharmacist my pharmacy gives me an information printout on each med i take every time it is filled or refilled i have bipolar severe mixed you are not alone i get paranoia and tend to be catastrophic and have many trust issues you must become your own advocate accept help when you can ask if you wonder take care of yourself is #1 i have boys i raised when diagnosed it was difficult but more freeing as children are more forgiving they do not need long or inappropriate information continued my love for them explained when "mommy" was not feeling well now they are young men who understand my disease and freely love me do not overburden your children with language they would not understand please take care and love yourself and love and respect your children,0
im bipolar2 have border line personality disorder n schizoaffective im on 200mg of lamotrigine 1500mg of depa kote 300mg of wellbutriuin 5mg of valium i take the lamotrigine n wellbutriuin in morning n others at night n suffer horrible insomnia my mind dosent let me sleep or shut down,0
im having the same problem with lamictal made me feel sick light headed and dizzy and nausea and rash i stopped taking it i also take a low dose of seraqual it seems to be making me ill too and making it hard to want to anything its hard getting out of bed and fighting fatigue i should be over side affects by now its been about 10 weeks and im inbetween drs appointments it sucks iv never had this much side affects maybe rash or nausea i almost want to go to the er but trying wait it out hoping the doc gives me something else cause i have a lot of anxiety on top of it,0
i totally relate to this sounds like youre talking right out of my head!!! i cant shake this horrible tired i was tired constantly before i started the meds n they started me at 25 mg of limictal after the first 11 days on that dose i was gtg then they doubled that n i am on now 50 mgs and i hate this feeling!!! i have had a headache seriously since i started the medication i feel more anxious and far more down than before i was medicated from what i can tell from other people this is part of your body adjusting to it i am told to keep trying it but the goal is to get me up to 200mgs and i already want to die at just 50mgs ugh keep at it talk to your prescriber and try to remember that this is just a phase and that it will balance out at some point :( sorry im not more help n dont have answers but you are defiantly not alone in the way youre feeling :(,0
cant say it enough talk to your dr - some meds need others to work better or that med might be to strong but when we first get put on meds to help our minds get what it needs we do sometimes crash you probably have not slept good in a long time so your body will make up for that once the mind is getting the right amount of meds it needs we all go threw guilt you have to remind yourself you took a step to make your and your son and familys life better you have taken control,1
most people with this illness need medication to me its a quality of life choice i take the minimum amount of medication to control my disease because the quality of my life is better with it than without it why choose misery over relative wellness? i dont want to just survive i want to live,0
i tried the no medication route and the anxiety became so bad that my hands and feet became freezing cold and mind my chest hurt like i was having a heart attack no more of that! i need to be medicated,1
i hate the part of "who am i ?" "is this really me?" etc of meds and bad side effects which is why im getting off gapentin and cymbalta ive been on gabapentin for 4 or so years for migraines and possible mood help thats a bitch to get off of cymbalta though pretty easy i have suicidal ideation generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder and psychotic depression w/ manic episodes i dont have much support save for my mother and a few other people but i am currently training a (currently 11w/o) chow/boxer/husky/staffie pit to be a service dog☺ hopefully i can be fully off my meds(minus the birth control) within the next 3 months the doggo is my service puppy in training spencer☺,1
i take meds for my bipolar 2 disorder i dont think that they help me though im still struggling a lot with my moods and with my depression! living with bipolar disorder and-or with depression makes life so difficult!,1
i was on a list of medications that would scare people at one point in time i am proud to say that i have been off all psych and epilepsy meds for over four years! there are days i feel like its too much to handle but overall i am dealing better off the meds than i ever could have on them!! it is doable!! and it is worth it!!!,0
i started seeing a naturopathic doctor after my psych basically told me im out of med options im not on any meds but have changed my diet drastically (gluten and dairy free) am taking iron supplements will be adding some homeopathic remedies soon as well as probiotics and protein shakes to fix "leaky gut" and keep my stress as low as possible for now it has worked amazingly! i can definitely tell how my mood changes and how much more susceptible to changing emotions i am when i eat gluten or dairy now that ive gone off it it might not work for everyone and some people can do it while staying on a very low dose of medication (i might have to go back on low dose of lithium once stress increases) but i figured it was certainly worth a shot! my dr tries to treat my whole body im also seeing an acupuncturist who does stuff with my head and gives some chinese medicine advice for it im currently doing more and more research into chinese medicine and reflexology and natural medicine stuff its amazing how deficiencies and poor diet can affect your brain also i was testing for neurotransmitter deficiencies so im waiting to hear the results and then will take a naturapathic approach to correcting them!,1
i have trouble understanding this (no disrespect) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial if someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesnt want to cos its medication you would be cross at them their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesnt make the insulin the same goes for depression just a different organ my brain doesnt make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesnt make insulin to get them throu i even tried on meds that were to low and i just couldnt keep my head above water but now im settled on the meds that are working for me i have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles dont get me wrong things arent all peachy and good i still have struggles but im much better at managing those times the other thing i learnt was people wait to look to get help people wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks i have someone close i spoke to saying if u notice im not good u need to tell me those close know something isnt good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help,0
i deal with my anxiety by taking my medsi also confront my anxiety but pushing myself to the limits,1
ive been dealing with mine on my own even thinking of meds makes me anxious ,0
if it were high blood pressure and you changed you diet and exercise and still suffered wouldnt you then talk with your dr about a low dose medicine to help you feel better?,0
i doits a struggle but focus on positivity and remove the triggers that set you off hope that helps,1
try to find a doc who will do extensive blood work to make sure all hormones are balanced and everything else is balanced integrative family medicine doctors do this and prescribe bioidenticals if needed then cut out gluten and anything else irritating to balance read the book "the mood cure" especially if you dont want pharmaceuticals,1
im on medicine but im horrible at taking it but i do notice a huge difference when im doing good and im on it it makes me feel soo much better,0
im not ive read too many horror stories seems like a case of the cure being worse than the disease,0
i dont medicate sure i take vitamin d to help but i stop or reduce my use in the summer some days i quite simply have to deal i have to cry my way through it pretend i feel happy put on false smiles when i feel like i cant even breathe feeling like everyone would be better off without me i have to struggle through and if i didnt have the partner that i have supporting me it would be a lot harder,0
ive been off an on medications over the yrs it totally depends on my stress level at the time i never pushed my son into taking meds eitherits definitely a personal choice my son asked to try meds a year ago at the age of 16 and it was his decision and it has been helpfulhe even made the 40 honor roll for the first time even with a learning disability i have also managed a youth mental health group home for the last 13 yrs and our clients have a says in their medication management as well ♡,1
im am currently off all my meds ill get back on them if i need to but ive been using vitamins and supplements and i also recently moved to co where pot is legal and i have found a couple strains that help my anxiety its new to me but i hate meds (and yes i know thats part of bipolar) but i have other health issues and it isnt smart for me to be on 20 different pills every day that do affect my liver and kidneys very badly i will say i always end up back in them when or if i have a bad manic episie but so far im keeping that under control by making myself eat and sleep that seems to break up a manic cycle take it if you need to but if you can manage without it i personally feel like thats a better way to go if you can handle it all,1
yes and no when first diagnosed with depression sad  and adhd i was put on meds for all three at the same time longggg story short it wasnt until many months later that i realized the anxiety meds did nothing for me and that the regular frequent and increasing dosage was why my grades tanked that spring although i had asked previously and was told otherwise i found out that the benzo was giving me memory loss and preventing me from retaining new info i was in vet school at the time obviously such side effects create more anxiety for me! i spent the next year off and on each med trying to figure out what the heck was happening dealing with depression and panic attacks along the way found a new doctor after concluding it wasnt getting better without meds new doctor she thinks my anxiety and depression may actually stem from not controlling my adhd we have been 10 months in now for just adhd meds without anxiety or depression meds not quite perfect yet but better than where i was if i could afford more therapy sessions with the psychologist i think i would be much much better and if i could get out of my living situation (the environment has triggers that would not be tolerable for healthy people at times),1
i was on lamictal and seraquel 10 years ago and they both incapacitated me to where i couldnt leave the house that lasted for a month then jumped off all my meds cause that just aint no way to live my life is a great big struggle but id rather live and screw up on a daily basis than be a walking zombie :) so nine years off all of it no regrets,0
♡ thats my biggest fear it affecting my kids more in the long run!,0
i have not been on medication for several years now i was not able to find one that really worked for me i started eating differently and exercising i started making time in the sun (just 15/20 minutes) a day a priority its hard to do that in the winter here however i do what i can i do still have severe lows i wont lie and say its easy it is just working for me i hope that everyone is able to find something that works for them be that medicine or not so much love to all who are struggling!!,1
the last medication i was on i had very strong suicidal thoughts and i even "self harmed" so i have been scared to try anything else! thats why im not medicated!!!,0
i have worked for years on my a/d this is what has helped me for depression i take 5-htp and walk when i walk i have my talks with god and give all my problems to him i also sort a lot out walking i know who i can talk to when im starting to feel depressed i dont try to hide it anymore for anxiety i deep breathe some people have a mantra they repeat to get past the anxiety i just talk to myself and remind myself i am ok i also avoid stimulants,1
im too scared to take all those medsthe side affects scare me to death i would like to try the canibus but dont know where from where i live,0
you will know if you need medication it is a matter of functioning or not functioning for me life or death; however mental illness runs in my family it is genetic for us i have not had the traumatic experiences which cause some people problems such as abuse or fighting in a war i think the cause of the mental illness has a great deal to do with the maintenance of the illness i am not a professional i have had a mental illness since i can recall; i was about 5 years old (depression) and am now 39 (bipolar 1 and ocd) life is a struggle sometimes but i can live a relatively "normal" life it is a personal decision like taking any other medication--for instance if high cholesterol runs in your family diet and exercise may not be enough to put your symptoms and numbers in check in that situation after the other changes have failed to make major alterations you may be prescribed medication by your doctor; however it is your personal decision to take them or not good luck to you and blessings on your journey!,1
i always feel like its more of a hassle to go to the drs and try to find the right meds i was diagnosed when i was 15 but i refused to do anything about it im 26 now and my current dr i have only told her about my anxiety and major depression most days i can be ok but others i dont get out of bed i have two young kids and it drives me insane that i dont have the energy or care to get up and do something i can manage to make sure there fed and clean but sometimes thats the best it gets i dont work right now so it not like i have places to be mental illness/addiction runs in my family ive lost 5 family members in the last 3 years to overdosingi have also had traumatic experiences while i was a child and now as a adult i dont have a support system so its hard and im scared to keep trying do the right med i know it would make a difference if i actually told my dr im bipolar and was re-evaluated now that im older and its worse but im to scared i guess,0
ive tried meds before with no such luck i decided to try nutritional response testing (acupressure) and found out i had tons of mercury and aluminum in my system which basically caused me to be in fight or flight mode all the time and made me have unbearable anxiety and depression changing my diet and detoxing from the heavy metals and i feel so much better!,1
im perscribed meds but i dont take them i struggle everyday to function my family n friends try to tell me i need them,0
i am currently unmediated as i am breastfeeding i did have the option of taking my medication with regular blood tests for both bub and i but chose not to i struggled throughout my pregnancy but seem to be doing ok now (8 months later) i struggle with anxiety at times and have recently struggled with high moods i was just thinking today a i am looking forward to going on my medication though,0
i need to be on meds or i lose touch with reality get very paranoid and slip into a psychosis i have bipolar 1,1
100% no medication never been on them i am able to handle my anxiety/depression without medications i find music and working out my coping mechanism,1
yes i work full time for a general surgeon work out is my escape - pulg in my head phones and blast my music i am married with two small children so yes i do support a family i may add my husband has a tbi and ptsd so im the only one who works not much family support as i dont talk to anyone about it because of my husbands own issues look im sorry if i am able to handle anxiety and depression without medications not everyone needs medicine what is with bashing people who can self manage? usually thats a good thing,1
im not taking meds they make me so ill i gave up on them 15 years of different types and they all floored me just struggle along now best i can,1
im 31 diagnosed at 19 every medication ive been on makes me sleepy and makes me feel like a zombie i have 3 kids i cant be sleeping all the time i do not take medication and havent for about a year now some days i struggle but for the most part ive learned how to deal with my emotions and not be on the emotional roller coaster,0
my personal experience get ready to be a guinea pig it took decades n numerous doctors to find a combo of six different medications that keep me stable n it takes weeks to see any affect but i suffer from three different diagnosis my point is yes it can get better im way better on medications than without but its a long road of trials be open n honest with your doctor tell them everything even if its small or embarrassing its the only way to get results,1
it all depends what is prescribed if you can handle whats going on stay natural but if it is thatn bad your life is getting interrupted i would worry about that and get fix more than sex,0
i get like you when my anxiety is at its highest peak i have to go and be alone in my room after i disconnect from people and noise it just gets too chaotic at times i can most likely return and try my best to keep as calm as i can anxiety is a monster their are many different meds to help i just happen to be med sensitive to most peace to you!✌,1
i think each and every person who posts about their struggles and triumphs while handling their respective mental illness(es) is very brave! respect is deserved for being able to be open about something so private! kudos and praying for the day i can be so brave!!,0
im so sick of closed minded people who have no idea what it is to suffer from mental issues nobody asks for this n if your not a person with a illnesses or a doctor youll never understand my heart has become hardened to this world i suffer from bipolar depression anxiety and have border line personality disorder and a schitso affective i spell horribly sorry my point is i have become very blunt n honest i tell ppl this upfront cuz i dont care what you think of me im me n cant change that if you cant deal with it theres the fn door n get out of my life dont be ashamed for who you are and remember you are not alone n although we dont know each other personally i am allways here to listen to someone who is struggling mentally best of luck,0
i feel like this is a version of the decision i have to make when someone asks how im doing do i give them the polite answer or the real one? not always an easy decision to make nor is it ever comfortable and i also have been on the other end sometimes it is not helpful to me to be on social media and sometimes it is not helpful to my health to hear about someone i care much about is struggling because i really do take all of that upon myself (i was told by a friend that my skills in being so sympath/empathetic was a gift but often times it is more of a curse) however i think the best thing you can do in this situation is to thank said family member for communicating that to you and offer them steps they can take to avoid seeing such posts it is possible to stay friends with someone and not see their posts on the newsfeed (this past election year for the us i learned real quick how to do that to extreme friends on all sides ;) )  keep your cool and remember it could be as simple as them not getting it or maybe not being able to handle it and approaching you about it (even if it was in a rude way) if it is really messing with your day wait to respond until you are feeling a bit better (i definitely know how this goes you dont want to ruminate excessively on a response nor do you want to say something you will regret later or be anxious about it i assume as a family member you will have to interact with this person again regardless what is said on facebook) again if the posts you make are helpful to you i feel you should be able to continue them without regret but maybe in the response if you feel comfortable doing it explain that to said family member how it is helping you by posting while acknowledging that it may not be helpful to him/her and presenting fair options to help this person filter it on their end,0
my assistant pastor told me that it wasnt a "faith statement" to post but for me it is very therapeutic ive found many online/friends turned out to be bipolar suffering depression which helps to know folks know what youre going through its kind of alarming when you realize the numbers too but i post anyway subscribe to pages like this (and on twitter also) and note in a diary app i even created a totally private page with a pseudonym wherein i can post exactly whatever and keep it to myself not on it much but its my page i can understand them being affected because it is pretty weighty id suggest creating a closed or private group and inviting only those folks who are genuinely supportive who want to understand love & prayers!!,0
keep on posting this is about your journey and if they are so uncomfortable with the information availed for them to get educated and maybe have some empathy then let it be their problem not yoursthey dont have to read your posts but you have the right to do what you are doing good luck & god bless ❤️,0
i always pretend to my family and friends because i know it upsets them but if they dont like it they dont have to read it xx,0
sorry that should say affect a lot of people will balk at this but part of dealing effectively with your condition is building resilience and self will and confidence thats nice talk for you have to toughen up i know its hard and it feels like going against yourself but to live well with your illness you will have to grow a thicker skin because people are hostile to things they dont understand and they are also very reluctant learners,0
i brag because there are days i cant ive been dealing with this illness since i was 19 so its been more than half my life i now keep a little welli call it my emergency backup kit with toothpaste shower wipes dry hair shampoo brush everything hygeine the struggles go on but i cant let it destroy other health care,0
maybe if you know youre getting anxious and depressed about itslow down and focus on just you and i dont mean masturbation either breathing exercisesmeditate read books cook food you love try to not be sexual it may help you figure out why you feel this way just an idea feel better,0
i use my alarm on my mobile the alarm doesnt turn off until i turn it off reminds me everyday,1
keep ur phone with u set ur alarm to the time u take ur meds the time u take them is crucial,1
i keep mine on the dining room table in front of my chair i have to take some of mine w food so its easiest to remember if theyre right in front of me when i eat morning and night i also set an alarm on my phone for 11am because im bad about forgetting to eat breakfast so its a reminder to eat and take meds if i havent already,1
set alarms on your phone,0
put an alarm on your phone i need to again it works there is an app,1
i have alarms on my phone and hubby usually asks me at bedtime if i remembered :),0
you could set an alarm on your cell phone,0
here is my technique- i have 8 boxes with 7 days a piece- the yellow one i pack with morning meds and the blue ones with evening meds (i take about 20 each morning and evening) so once packed i have a month of meds i keep one set on the dining room table (no kids around) and if the correct color is not showing my husband will just say have you taken your meds? i rarely miss my meds with this system i am 60 with bipolar 1 and recently diagnosed anxiety disorder,1
i have 2 weekly pill containers one for am one for pm and i fill them up weekly that way i always know if i have taken my meds for the day or not i also used to set alarms on phone for morning and night time,1
i have a day of the week dispenser i carry with me that way if i am unsure if i have taken them or not i can just check that particular days section i fill it up straight away every wednesday after i have taken that days meds also the reminders on here help :-) x,1
i set alarms on my phone & keep the bottle in my fist until i do!!,1
i use a pill box and also set an alarm on my phone,1
they sell pill boxes with an alarm on them check amazon,0
alarm on your phone for everyday,0
try a dosette box you fill it once a week and put it somewhere you will see it try it with an alarm on your phone to remind you,1
i set an alarm on my phone to go off at the time im supposed to take my med,1
you could get a locking pull caddy that when its time it turns and sets off a loud alarm,0
i dread the nightits the worse ,0
from a support persons perspective i dont "throw it back in their face" but do point out the irrational thinking and behaviours so when an manic episode is starting my loved one will understand when i say "your getting sick " and will hopefully get the proper support before all the trouble lands them in the psyc ward jail or worse dead (so far only 2 out of 3 but my biggest fear is the one we have been able to aviod so far),0
it is a horrible horrible disease for the afflicted and their loved ones i sit here one of the collateral damaged but i know for my mom the afflicted with manic depression it was a greater hell she was in than mine,0
thats actually true i hv been struggling with bipolar disorders since years of medication has not helped me n my own confident dont understand,1
guilt is such a huge struggle for many of us i carry it around every day and its exhausting but its so hard to let go of i can feel your pain just for reading your post the fact - that you think about it makes you a great mom we just have a hard time forgiving ourselves at least i do,0
im bipolar 11 which is diagnosed major depressive episodes hypomania talking way to fast we are fidgety cant sleep for long periods at a time without feeling sleepy kinda like being on a speed drug mania causes you to act irrationally like just packing up and leaving everything behind when you finally become more rationale again you=e like what the heck did i do our thought process is way out there in left field beleive g that what we say is the gospel we are difficult to treat coming up with the right drug combination is difficult hope this helps those that dont understand the scale  ,0
this is new to me but i understand it im very bipolar and i make destructive decisions and irrational choices what type do you think i am? be nice to see what yall think so when i get to dr i get medicine that helps,0
i have a child the same and a partner with adhd i understand somewhat of what you go through its soo stressful,0
sometimes the soul is big and bright and the only way to satisfy it is locating its counterpoint and not forcing something that you know you dont feel because you will be miserable,0
idk i get very shakey during and anxeity attack,0
yep they will never understand the struggle,0
i cant make simple phone calls or answer them that stops a lot of thing currently flowing in my life to continue to flow with ease i rely to heavily on my partner to do simple things i should be able to do even like going to the doctors to getting my anxiety dealt with seems like it takes months of coercing for myself etc,1
when im overwhelmed i just pull away the few channels and connections that need to be made are kept going as they are a necessity other than that there might be some hard decisions that you just have to make in your favor we need some wins i hope my little rant was not bothersome i have my own mental illnesses everyone has their own this works for me if it works for someone else great if not sorry,1
yep same hear i have to get someone to come to the doctors and even then i often cant go i constantly cancel things and avoid the phone door ect,0
i have trouble understanding this (no disrespect) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial if someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesnt want to cos its medication you would be cross at them their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesnt make the insulin the same goes for depression just a different organ my brain doesnt make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesnt make insulin to get them throu i even tried on meds that were to low and i just couldnt keep my head above water but now im settled on the meds that are working for me i have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles dont get me wrong things arent all peachy and good i still have struggles but im much better at managing those times the other thing i learnt was people wait to look to get help people wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks i have someone close i spoke to saying if u notice im not good u need to tell me those close know something isnt good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help,0
im glad you made this statement i always wonder if meds are good for me or not i think it depends on the severity of your illness some people are born with it and really just have to learn to cope therapy and medication help those individuals but my mother believes in trying to better your state of mind naturally whether its waking up early amd starting a routine cleaning exercise arts and crafts changing your lifestyle to where you are a little more productive can make a big positive change in your life when im active im happier when im not i se to dwell on negitivity for me its jist a battle of staying active staying positive i tale meds no therapy but i do lots of arts and crafts,0
i was on medication for years but it just made me very tired and gain weight ive been off since may i can get really anxious sometimes but i try to go for a walk or listen to music and it will usually pass im hoping exercise will help too,1
why be so miserable when you dont have to be? meds really do help most people :),1
i did say most people there are plenty out there that cant tolerate them im sorry for your struggle this thing is a crazy ass beast! :(,0
ive tried numerous prescription medications and was more miserable on them than off! i do occasional use cannabis to relax me,1
i smoke cannabis oil and it will help being manic symptoms down like rapid heart beat racing thoughts anxiety the urge to constantly be doing something it really helps prevent manic episodes,1
yes sometimes the anxiety can be too much for me! i have found some good edibles that gives me the calm that i need! i just can get them all the time!,1
yep it can increase anxiety temporarily but the relaxation that comes afterward is so comfortable :),1
sometimes its necessary there is no sense in struggling through life when there are things out there that can help you live a more fulfilled life!! good luck my friend!! im here if you need an understanding ear! plus ill be graduating in may with a degree in psychology & certification in crisis intervention,0
nicole i would love a life without meds but my life was not what i wanted it to be without meds i have come to accept that i will always be on meds the depression would eat me alive i dont try to push just letting people know my experience on the meds im on or have been on i have biplor ii the irritability and rage was too much for me to handle on my own good luck to you whichever road you choose ,0
ive been smoke marijuana most of my adult life and it helps me better than any pill ive tried everyone is different and some say it makes them paranoid so cbd oil might be a better place to start than just smoking the flower depending on how it may effect you,1
i have been on every man made med since i was 14 and im now 31 i straight up told my doctorsno more medical cannabis is my choice as its natural and great to help me eat and sleep  and calm my horrible thoughts which are constant it isnt for everyone but just thought id throw it out there good luck ,1
 this has helped me through a lot calms me down when i get in panic attack mode,1
stop taking it personally and trying to be her savior use your understanding to recognize that her symptoms cannot be relieved by you what works for you might likely not work for her she must find her way for herself your job is not yo fix her only support she is probably pulling away from the pressure you are putting on her not to isolate shes going to isolate like it or not its part of the symptomology,1
im scared to go back on my lithium i rather drink in my house,0
i thought avoiding eye contact is a autism thing?,0
it can also be anxiety a lot of people with anxiety wont be able to make eye contact i used to do it when mine was really bad always kept my eyes on the floor or on things around me for some reason it freaked me out to look people in the eye,1
see your doc tell them its an emergency or call an out of hours one  you must be feeling dreadful big hug,0
wth? i was told to never manufacture excuses for how i acted or how i felt it is a disease not something to be victimized! the moon was full smacks of lunacy; or crazy something we fight hard to overcome any stigma of left unsupervised? so we have to be cared for like a child? come on admins you know this is not the message we want to put out there for people suffering depression bipolar or anxiety! ive been seeing too much of this like of postings on this site for my liking,0
but re-reading this post its not really one of the bad ones when you are struck with bipolar/depression/anxiety it does make you feel pretty helpless,1
i have a horror story about that medicine a friends brother had a very tragic reaction to it,0
first of all if you can you need to go and fight this out at your pharmacy and have them correct the problem this has happened to me before but the pharmacy will be shaken by you confronting them about you going cold turkey off your meds you cant and shouldnt do thus it is very dangerous if its there screw up they need to fix it but deal with them face to face good luck,1
i feel this way all the time off and onthats the horrible reality of bipolar disorder did you take you medicine as directed? you shouldnt run out before the next refill if thats the case you need to be really careful about thatif not talk to your doctor about adjusting your prescription call them and tell them what has happened most of them are more than willing to help fill the gaps with your meds,1
i have ptsd but im also a clinical therapist i would advise to see your doctor and ask for an anxiety medication in addition to the antidepressants antidepressants dont help for panic attacks and if your out of the months supply already you might be trying to self medicate with the wrong meds taking more than the prescribed antidepressants can give you side effects like suicidal thoughts i would even advocate you smoking a marijuana joint it has instant calming effects call your doctor,1
i used to be you dont worry youre not alone we are even the same age sometimes the things that should make us happy get to be over whelming where do we go from here please work on making small reachable rewarding goals for yourself when you feel like self harming play with your children be goofy force yourself to live ive also started cbd it has worked wonders for me ive also made some other changes as i suggested and im slowly figuring out that my life my journey all depends on me i have the power to control my thoughts they dont control me i hope you can find better outlets until your meds can be fixed stay strong and hang in there youre loved more than youll ever know,0
i have bpd and bipolar 2 my bad days sneak up on me even though i am taking my meds as prescribed when i notice that i am going down i distract myself i keep my hands busy so im not itching to harm myself i knit and to take my mind off things i watch series or a movie if you have pets they are great for therapy marijuana does help alot with anxiety in this last year i havent been able to have much therapy because money has been super tight so i had to teach myself to cope please phone your doctor to adjust your meds so you have enough for the month if you find you cant cope with what ive mentioned for distracting yourself then definitely go to the er they will be able to sedate you to keep the edge off before you can get your prescription best of luck i hope things come right,1
cbd oil helps really well with anxiety and depression its made from marijuana but without the thc that gets you high its over the counter in health stores in florida pretty sure it is in all 50 states right now,1
you can find it on the iternet they have it in vape form and in candy form too im still doing my research on a company that sells online before i try i have a chronic disease as well as depression anxiety and bipolar,1
buy a b complex vitamin almost all woman havea b defiency which causes anxietyin which may help prevent that theres also a website that gives you 75 percent off prescriptions that walgreens honor,1
im against marijuana but when its for medicinal purposes im all for it my daughter used to get bad anxiety attacks so i took her to get some marijuana the guy there explained what would help her the best it helped her and im grateful for it being sold im not saying to buy some because that would be your choice you should find out about your medicine god bless,1
i would talk to your dr about an adjustment if you are already out of your medication either you need a higher dose or something else because while some anxiety meds are "as needed" antidepressants are taken regularly at the same time same time every day to be effective either way please talk to your dr because you dont have to suffer!,1
eating a apple a day also helps with anxiety and depression,1
im 23 my life isnt together and i have depression and bad anxiety during an attack tell yourself to breathe through it and that your okay over and over again as far as self harm goes look at yourself in the mirror tell yourself your beautiful and that you dont want to hurt yourself over and over again until the feeling goes away you got this i feel your pain i really do you can get through this and also let your husband know how you are feeling so that he can watch you and help you through this,0
ahh yes so true shame we have to hide sometimes,0
i can sure relate my mental illnesses to him jezzzz i still miss mourn him dearly especially daily when i see his movies comedy showmork & mindy mrs doubt fire ,0
the other scars i view with contempt and shame and want them out of my sight,0
ive seen some pretty awesome tattoos to cover cutting scars my son cut for a short period of time we were moving from california to louisiana he was so upset about moving thats when it started i immediately took him to his psychiatrist he was 14 now hes 18 he hasnt cut since,1
when i wasnt medicated i usually got so mad that id usually go and punch a steel locker to avoid punching others i left multiple deep fist shape dents in the steel broke my knuckle a few times one time my knuckle was swolen for a month its very dangerous for me to not be medicated one wrong word and id kill someone,0
me too no fear just rage i just want to punch someone in the throat! i get very aggressive,0
when ever i get into that rage/irritation mode all i can feel is anger i dont feel anything but anger no fear or anything else i plan on staying on my meds just hoping i can get off the depakote i really really dont like the weight i have gained,0
i always say acceptance is the hardest thing in life id kill to be the old me whenever ive tried getting off meds the bipolar comes quick irritable and full of rage and then i spiral way down into the depression i just cant handle that please stay on your meds i dont want you to die,0
as soon as i start crying my eyes burn so much i have to stop because the pain gets so bad and the longest i can go without my meds is about 4 days after that the bipolar swings right on in and i have come to terms that i will be on meds most of my life as well i cant risk it ive almost died way too many times because of my mood swings,0
crying only makes it worse but it is an outlet for the depression then i get a migraine damned if you do damned if you dont i totally understand not wanting to be on more meds i dont like being on all that im on but ive come to accept that i need them and probably will for the rest of my life ive tried going off of a few and it was a disaster it was to the point where i shouldve been hospitalized but i just wouldnt put that worry on my kids,0
yes full neuropsych testing have me my iq strengths weaknesses and an adhd inattentive type diagnosis on low dose focalin it wired up the anxiety tho chemical balances are so intriquite,1
i vape cbd oil it only helps my anxiety a little bit,1
i need to ask my doctor for an adhd test because ive already been diagnosed with bipolar 1 generalized anxiety ptsd and borderline personality i have so many of the symptoms associated with adhd but i just dont know what to say or how to bring it up to my dr,0
i had testing in the fall there was a computer test and iq because even after being stable for a few years i was still having extreme difficulty focusing my results surprised me but showed adhd without a doubt and i was started on adderall adderall was the missing piece of the puzzle for me it made a huge difference in my life especially at work best of luck to you!!,0
i was never diagnosed with adhd until around age 30 desperate i did a round of tests like it sounds you did i was complating going back to school but didnt want to if it was just some else i was going to fail at my results were helpful the iq testing gave me a number that told me i wasnt too stupid to try this and when we found the right medicine lets just say i made an a in a course i had failed once and taken an incomplete in the second time since youve already finished testing find out everything you can from them it reassured me and can help you in making plans for the future,0
the iq test scared me the most dont know my results of it yet but curious to know what affect it has on diagnosis with adhd are peoples iq with adhd high or low? maybe he was testing it to see if i had learning disabilities i suppose i get what your saying though! always wanted to go to college but i cant read or study to save my life,0
testing for all that?! get another dr be just honest and open with your symptoms - all of them even the good ones anxiety can be related to paranoia which is a scale and not just thinking aliens are after you or some shit,1
makes my anxiety through the roof however i have used cbd oil and it does help with my anxiety but none of my other symptoms,1
i was misdiagnosed with add/hd growing up my behavioral anomalies were actually symptoms of childhood anxiety it was the 90s any kid who didnt sit still for more than 10 minutes had add to most doctors,1
my son has always been told adhd i always said that they were wrong he now has diagnosis of szioeffective mood disorder acute anxiety took many years but have the right set of therapists/psychs now and right combo of meds his psychosis is very stable moods are starting to stabalize but anxiety is sky high its a long road but keep going there is the right combo out there,1
well here goes the anonymous aspect of the post lol ive been diagnosed with depression social anxiety and bipolar that was from my psychiatrist im on wellbutrin (which i love) lamictal and lexapro,0
anytime the drs tweak your meds is usually a rough ride try to hang on while the new meds work their way into your system music helps meeither playing or just listening to it dont be afraid of your emotionsjust try not to add too much weight to them good luck & godspeed,1
focus on somethinganythingbreathe pray make sure psych knows its emergency you be seen if you cant wait until then you get dressed and you self talk yourself into going to er you will be ok i know i also have to do a lot of self assuring that i can go places its not easy there comes a time where you have to do things that sure uncomfortable you can do it!,0
yes i can relate  story of my life  im not on meds but i also feel like not getting out of bed  i cant deal with my days im always overloaded in my head ive been falling into a deep dark hole myself  i dont think i can pull myself out again  nothing is working for me either  im all alone  ive tried so many things i dont have bipolar but i dol have depression and anxiety and bpd and sleep problems along with mild disabilities  im definitely at the suicidal point  glad you are not there  i cant ever seem to escape my head  i can never get a break  your not alone  i understand completely  the struggle is real ,0
i am going through that too change of meds and too manny side affects light headedness dizzy and a lot of anxiety and panic attacks and depression its hard iv been wanting to go to the e r but i did a couple of mothes ago cause i couldnt sleep for about two months anyway i went to the er cause i started thinking for the first time of self harming i didnt do anything but it scared me the kept me on a 72 hour hold and sent me to another hospital they gave me new meds iv been home for two months now but still having a lot of side affects from new meds and a lot of anxiety and panic attacks it sucks my meds cause me to be dizzy light headed and nausea and not helping the anxiety attacks iv been wanting to go back to my doctor too but appointment not till august 14 iv been deep breathing and forcing myself to exersize a little and pushing myself to walk everyday it helps some but i too have been struggling to get out of bed changing the meds sucks and iv been wanting to go to the doctor but he is also booked all the time and people been it takes a while for the meds to kick in but its been too long i would go to the doctors as soon as you can i know its hard and scary,1
i think u should call the doctor first things monday tell them exactly how u r feeling and let them know its an emergency if they cannot get u in on monday u need to ask them what u r suppose to do?? be assertive and tell them that u need help its not okay for you to feel this way and mental health is as important as physical health! u must take care of yourself because you r worth it im currently in a very similar situation and i make sure i let my doctor know dealing with mental health and the mental health field can be horrible until monday i think you should take care of yourself take a nice warm bath or shower get ur comfy clothes on call someone who understands what u r going thru reach out to other here or send me a message i know what u r going thru you will be in my thoughts know that u r not alone in this!!,0
sorry for what you are going through agoraphobia i can relate my late mom and sister have dealed with this disease plus manic depressive my entire lifetime too much overthinking what will happen the agoraphobia will give you panic attacks try do something get your mind off these thoughts ,0
i have been where you are its horrible the only thing that helped me was staying busy as much as i didnt want to i forced myself to get out of bed everyday to get dressed and to go out even if it was only for a short walk it helped - sending healing thoughts your way ❤️,0
i have fibromyalgia and it can add to the depression and anxiety my whole body feels like flu aches and intensifies with stress,1
i suffer as well with anxiety and my body hurts think its a common symptom,1
i have bpd and they tried soo many antidepressants etc before they found 1 that helped! i am currently on paxil along with adder rallamictal lithium abilify which is a godsend and ativan and baclofen for anxiety,1
put your keys or phone on to of them alarm in your phone or a note on the door,1
i put all my meds into containers every week so its laid out easy mornings are with coffee and night time is by the bed i also set and alarm for them on my phone just in case i also put my meds in different color containers orange for morning and sunrise blue for dark and sleep that way i never get confused,1
i also have an alarm on my phone for my dinner and evening meds i find this really helpful my morning meds ive never had trouble remembering as i take them with breakfast,1
set an alarm on your phone i have that plus i keep my meds in a dosett box beside my bed so i take them just after breakfast when i get ready in the morning and just before going to bed at night but the alarm is key it takes 21 days to build a new habit taking ng tablets is a habit we all need to get into,1
you have company most teens have gone through this stage yes lots around you love you teens can be so cruel my youngest daughter still suffers try all natural products n avoid anything with sylacidic acid which will just irritate the skin most product out there for acne have this in it she has success with burts bee blemish treatment; a roll on lemon glycerin n aveno soy based face wash also if your family has insurance tell youre parents the trouble your having n go to a dermatologist might be more than just the teenage acne most suffer through,0
please discuss the risks of accutane with your doctor before taking it i know multiple people that had terrible side effects,1
in my experience accutane does work very well our 2 sons had horrible cystic acne during puberty their faces cleared up and the "zits" never returned if you are female  you cannot become pregnant the drug can cause severe birth defects and suicidal thoughts enough already talk to your primary care doctor or psychiatrist now you have no need to suffer there are so many treatments available to you if you dont have insurance go to a free clinic or planned parenthood they are not just about "sex pregnancy prevention and abortions" there is your school guidance counselor- they may have an idea good luck i wish you the best,1
first thing you should do before anything is to go to a dr you dont want to take a chance and cause further damage everybodys face is different now i will agree that the acne is secondary you need to work on your strength learn to not let people bother you so much there are people out there who find you beautiful if you need to see a therapist then do that or just find someone anyone with a good heart we all have faults the mean people poke at you to avoid their faults fuck them!!!,1
i have the exact same problem mate go to a doctor the should prescribe you some pills and/or cream the strong cream is called skinoren and the pills are called lymocycline they really help me and as for the people in your school just ignore them if it gets too far dont hesitate to get help if they harm you thats a completely different issue and im not gonna suggest you do what i did but good luck x,1
suicide not an option! talk to a kind doctor if depression is severe seek help immediately acne does heal i promise! i had it for years bullies are just horrid people talk to someone u trust,1
how old are you? do you leave in a hot or cold climate? do you take antidepressants or birth control? i am a woman now 40 always had acne always will stress breaks me out here it what ive done that improved it light 2 month level use of accurate no sugar no sweets no soda more water 1500 mg of l lysine daily turmeric salads added to diet good luck,0
some forms of acne cannot be cured without prescription meds i have cystic acne which was really irritated by my bi-polar meds go to a dermatologist it usually only takes one visit to get it fixed please dont give up on yourself because it is something so temporary ,1
i use to use rubbing alcohol and worked whl younger but dint give a rats ass nowstill get teased by it by insecure men but they can go fuck themselves,1
i personally have never struggled with bad acne but ive had friends who have and could never find a solution i love natural products and making my own things ive used it as body wash and a good many of my friends use it and love it all different ages and skin types each ingredient has a purpose and ive even shaved my face chest and legs to test it for women and to see how well it worked on freshly shaven faces chests legs etc heres my recipe for a great face wash coffee grounds brown sugar coconut oil baking soda cucumbers oat meal honey tea leaves tea tree oil lemon juice zinc melatonin sea salt cinnamon pm me if you have any questions as to what each thing does or any questions at all bananas,0
my friend i totally understand your pain while there are some good suggestions given here the only way to rid your face is going to be inside out! i had severe cystic acne not just a few whiteheads and some blackheads im talking sever cysts and redness all over my body it was horrific and bullying doesnt do justice what peers said and did to me! first let me implore to you you are worthy you are valued and loved despite what others may say your outward appearance does not define you and if people are bullying you well there is something wrong with them not you!! there are many treatments for severe acne and none of them have to do with greasy foods or to much chocolate stigmas absolutely exist with acne just like mental illness find a dermatologist and ask him to explain how accutane works you must be diligent with blood work and follow up with drs but i promise you it will be very worth it not only did it work for me but because it is hereditary my son got it bad as well i immediately put him on this treatment with dermatologist supervision and within 1 school year he went from redness and cysts to not one blemish or pock mark on his face!! and went on to enjoy the last few years of his high school term i refused to allow him to go through the horrific things that severe acne suffer with please please if you want relief from this find a dr and get started if you have any problems getting the right info please do not hesitate to inbox me and i will help you as much as possible!!! your life is so valuable and you are a blessing to many people even if it doesnt feel like it at the moment!!! please dont give up!!!,0
ive read vitamin d helps with acne just taking it as a supplement also try sleeping with a white pillow case because some dyes irritate the skin there are a lot of things in a diet that can also affect the skin and hormone problems as well,1
i totally understand a few months ago i was in the same boat sometimes people can be super sensitive to topical acne treatments salcylic acid breaks me out worse and its usually a first line treatment the only thing that has mostly worked for me is a simple cleanser and moisturizer i use cerave products the gentle cream cleanser and the moisturizing lotion every morning and at night i do the same and use the cerave serum - which has retinol which is good from everything from fine lines to acne be sure to wear sunscreen because it has a tendency to make you burn faster for whatever reason i know youll have an overwhelming amount of responses but just remember sometimes its better to start from scratch also i stopped drinking caffeine and i believe that has helped my skin immensely as well and my anxiety too,1
you have to determine your skin type oily combo whatever to really pick the right otc products or else they dont help also dont switch products constantly it irritates skin and expect it to get worse before when you do start something new because your skin may freak at first like what is this goop lol if nothing worms see a dermatologist salicylic acid is made for acne,1
it takes time so allow yourself to heal cry uncontrollably scream to the top of you lungs feel sad feel broken but dont allow it to define you you are not unlovable this relationship was a part of you but its not you take this time to reflect on who you are who you want to become and reflect on what you want from a relationship if you get yourself in the right head space the next time around you will be able to bring 110% into the next relationship,0
i know exactly what you are going through my gf/fiancée of 16 years left me 2 weeks and 1 day ago  the heartache and the hurt is so unbearable that i cant handle it or stand it  i thought for sure i finally found the one that i could be with forever  she will and always be the love of my life i still love her and care about her and worry about  i miss her so much and love her so much that its killing me inside  we both have a mental illness / illnesses  it seems as the days go bye it gets harder and harder to live without her ,0
bipolar is not easy deal with which one struggle everyday!,0
that is basically what i was told too but i am bipolar ptsd social anxiety disorder chronic depression meds make a difference,1
i have almost all of these symptoms doubt i have bpd though anger issues run on my family and the rest can be connected to depression anxiety and having everyone except family abandon you after some time since childhood,0
i always thought this was in my head and i was a danger to those around me spent 3 months in physciatric hospital and now waiting for dbt therapy to start been out 9/10 weeks and struggling just wish i knew others that could relate to me ,0
car thank you hun just struggling quite a bit at the moment same always hate if you need anything xxx,0
iv not read any comments just read this because it is not correct do not tell your self because you have bpd you think other that know you have this you are like this list they will think you are!!great worry:(,0
this post isnt even accurate! signs and symptoms people with bpd may experience extreme mood swings and can display uncertainty about who they are as a result their interests and values can change rapidly other symptoms include frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment a pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family friends and loved ones often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation) distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self impulsive and often dangerous behaviors such as spending sprees unsafe sex substance abuse reckless driving and binge eating recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self-harming behavior such as cutting intense and highly changeable moods with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days chronic feelings of emptiness inappropriate intense anger or problems controlling anger having stress-related paranoid thoughts having severe dissociative symptoms such as feeling cut off from oneself observing oneself from outside the body or losing touch with reality,0
story of my life i struggle with these things daily,0
with me people just thought i was explosive when i was angry and that was just my personality my kids friends called me the witch from the mountains i now take three different meds but i have ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar but i am so much calmer and easier to get along with now,1
yes i know just one of mine is over 900$ if my insurance didnt pay for it its horrible you know it only costs the drug companies pennies on the dollar to make the drugs,0
i have these symptoms but have never been diagnosed with bpd i do take regular medication for anxiety though should i be looking to be diagnosed and if so do i need medication?,1
most if not all of these are symptoms of other disorders or even things that people with neurotypical brains experience you only need medication for something if it will improve your quality of life if you have concerns that your current medication/diagnosis doesnt cover talk to your doctor about them they can make a determination about another diagnosis/changing your medication/what have you otherwise dont worry yourself by assuming you have a completely different disorder when you might not fit the criteria at all,1
all those are me to a tyet im remain undiagnosed i have manic depression and high anxiety and insomnia,1
i highly relate to all of the above n its horrible its like your trapped inside a bubble full of water and everyone around you is oblivious to it they cant help you because they dont no how to or they dont notice the difference in you,0
right now i am more depressed than i think i have ever beenmy mood swings are ridiculous i either have insomnia or sleep for hours on end i have a lot of other health issues and other things that i am dealing with right now that have me stressed out,1
no i havent i live in an area that people will abuse antipsychotic medicine and my doctor will not write prescriptions for anything that has "street value" plus i am a recovering addict and recovering alcoholic so i am limited to what doctors will give me i have been sober from alcohol only 18 days i tried for months to get into rehab and had several trips by ambulance to the er for having seizures from alcohol withdrawal and got turned away without any help i ended up getting 2 duis in one week and ended up in jailthe jail doctor detoxed me with meds from the alcohol and i only had one mild seizure while i was there and luckily it was in front of the doctor so she knew what to do and how to treat me i am home now and on home confinementreally depressed and stressedbut i am sober :) been drug free for over 6 months,1
your rightcause i dontand hope i wont !!!!!that scares me ,1
angel scott im the same had it bit longer though and had dbt it helped but i found when i stopped i lost it again am still having an uphill struggle but knowing ive my 2amazing daughters and sister there when ever i need them does help most times wish you all to find what works for you xx,1
i have bpd (borderline personality disorder) diagnosed 10yrs ago its a struggle everyday there are no mess for it but dbt (dialectical behavior therapy )really helps it has been the only thing that seems to help along with regular therapy,1

depression and guilt let go of the guilt float out of the depression this too shall pass! stay on your medicine !!!,1
i thinkblargh which is like blah ugh tired overwhelming and guilt,0
feeling totally confused and overwhelmed with everything thats the only way i can describe this my niece has this condition is on meds to keep things stable she was very ill at one time and had to be in hospital for treatment,0
the assholes who run this page are as bad as the hospital constantly focusing on the negative makes it all 10x worse you stupid fucks! post some pictures of cute puppies or some shit going on and on about how horrible being bipolar or depressed or anxious is is not going to fuckin help anyone!,0
my x girlfriend is bipolar and has other mental health issues she is also struggling with an addiction to crack  we just recently broke up after 7 years she lives in oklahoma and we have had a long distance relationship for the past year she has been on a sabotage pattern she has been cheating on me with anyone who gives her any kind of attention she has really ended any feeling l could ever have again with her i was somehow trying to talk myself to think all of what she is doing is because she is in a maniac state rt now she has been off her med and not even concern about seeing a dr she says she says she is clear headed and is more like her real self than ever she has been saying some very hurtful things to me about being with other people  i finally had to block her from every outlet it is killing me to see her in pain but she doesnt seem to care about my pain anymore i have had to get in depression and anxiety medication due to all this i dont know what else to do?,0
i am also bipolar plus ocd anxiety ptsd and depression i tried all of the mood stabilizers and i would literally fall asleep at my desk at work abilify was great but weight gain was unbearable im now on effexor 225mg remeron and trazodone i just started remeronweight gain again but i am to the point where i would rather have that than the alternative it truly has been a god send good luck hun,1
i totally understand im rarely evened out or middle of the road but now ive learned to sense it when it comes over me more i still get way overwhelmed but too i try to get a handle on it im on 4 meds it takes patience and lots of work to control some can never achieve peace i know ill never be at peaceprayers for you,0
im bipolar 1 with mixed episodes and i totally understand it is very difficult to explain everyone thinks its one or the other your either hi or low but thats just not the case i dont know if i could actually say anything that would help honestly just know that your not alone theres lots of us out there and do the best you can everyday not for anyone else but for yourself i personally feel accomplished when i make it through those horrible episodes because i made it through and you will too dont give up it took me a few doctors and a few decades to find the right meds for me but i finally have now so again dont ever give up you will figure out what works best for you just keep being honest about everthing to your doctors thats whats worked for me,0
yes its an uncomfortable feeling and i feel intense confusion ,0
a stable life sleep pattern all help stay away from stress / stressful ppl too much is sometimes not good there are loads of side effects check urs change if necessary every case/ person different but just general advice,1
im sorry thats horrible,0
what youre experiencing is called a mixed state i experience them too although ive got type 2 bipolar it can be really tough but ive experienced episodes of it where i function well considering everything thats happening in my head other times i really struggle its really difficult to explain unfortunately,0
yes definitely how i feel about it its a daily struggle and a nightmare,0
yep i struggle with this every day i try,0
those who laughed dont truly understand what a real struggle this is,0
omg im fighting tears right now! its been a stressful emotional week for me!,0
wowthats me and it makes me upset to be like this!!!! no happy medium ,0
so the thing about that is that intentional motional reactions can have a physical side effect its no joke that we tend to store our pain our suffering  or even our stress into our body it may be side effects but its always a good idea to talk to your doctor,0
i get short of breath and heart palpitations i saw the doctor but it was anxiety,1
that is so true my daughter goes through this and its very hard to watch and understand but if people would take the time and learn about how to help and handle the struggles of the people who have to struggle with this illnesses you are correct if it was cancer or something you could see then it is acceptable so unfair for everyone,0
hi there it sounds as though you have been through a lot post natal depression can be awful but of course depression can re occur later good question; will you always be on them? id rather look at it in this way; rather than getting caught up with fixating on the medication as a bad thing i believe if it is helping if is making you feel better if it is the crutch that is helping you live your life enjoy your children if is it allowing you to cope then surely its got to be worth it and it is making the difference between your life working and not working i got so caught up at one stage when i had rebuilt my life and recovered in the idea that i had to come off them i thought i was coping well and knew i wasnt depressed i even went to the doctors and tried to discuss the idea of coming off them i had convinced myself leading up to the appointment that this was the best step but deep down i had a nagging doubt that if i encountered anything particularly difficult whether id be able to cope luckily my doctor was great we discussed it fully and she helped me to see that being on the medication isnt a sign of weakness its nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of and coming off them too quickly might not be the best plan i guess i knew that deep down i had just got so caught up with the idea that to be fully better i needed to come off the medication i think especially if you have a lot of stress in your life it might not be the best time to come off discuss it with the professionals talk to your loved ones but dont feel you have to rush into anything best wishes x,0
yes ive been on both  i dont have any med s i cut myself down slowly and never bothered again  i do get odd bad day and still feel anxiety at times but i try and stay away from stressful people and situations just keep happy people around and situations i also started going to church god helps a lot too xx,0
i gave up on the citalapram - it gave me that restless leg syndrome i had to take it at night just before bed otherwise it made me feel quite ill best thing i *ever* found for the anxiety/hyper-vigilance phases (i got ptsd too) are beta-blockers  theyre fkcing great saved my life a thousand times,0
once you find the right meds it usually takes at least two or three together then you will have a big step forward meds cant take away personal issues in your life but it will allow you to handle tense situations a lot better,1
i have tried to go off meds gradually several times but it didnt go well i am currently taking 3 different meds for my depression/anxietyi have accepted the fact that i will always be on meds,1
im talking about cannabis sativa or indica strains or hybrids can really help people,0
wish my dumb parents would get this thru there head so thru would understand how badly im struggling,0
yes yes yes im so glad someone said exsactlly how i feel  ppl act like i can just snap out of my depression it dont work like that  ive been struggling for years with out meds  and right now im not in therapy and i really need it and im so alone and hopeless and my depression is suffocating me i just want to die my thoughts are so suicidal and dark and morbid and very negative  i cant control it there so intense  i did not ask to have depression cans anxiety but i do but ppl make me feel like its my fault dns im a bad person which lowers my already low self esteem ,0
epilim is excellent !!! the old mood stabiliser was lithium which was hard on the kidneys you do not have to worry about that with epilim you can still experience highs and lows but they are not as extreme if you have trouble with grandiose manias seroquel is good if you have trouble with depressions there are a lot of choices do not stop taking your medicine ever !,1
remember things get better we all had similar experiences try doing a little more each day things that u like try see positives each day stay away from stress pray to god x,0
i feel like you really need to tell your psychiatrist this because they can change up your medicine to help you especially ask for something for anxiety i dont know how well itd work on you but xanax has helped the best for me i havent had an anxiety attack or mental break down since taking it,1
first i cant tell you what to do or how to do it all i can do is tell you my experience with this i was born with brain damage caused by the doctor which left me in a state of really bad disorders so you could say i led what does from the day i was born not know why i was so different from the other kids until i started asking questions i learned about my disorders but when it really got bad this after my ex left and took the kids to parts unknown ive had two nervous breakdowns and the first one was really bad i tried three times to kill myself twice with a shotgun and once with pills it was weeks later my doctor found out about the pills banding a map i took along with alcohol i should have died that day but i got the worst case of diarrhea i had to sit on the toilet all day and half the night i realized i couldnt kill myself but i didnt know i was going to die not once but twice in one evening months later i had gotten bit by a rattlesnake halfway point between where i live to where the hospital where i got the anti-venom because the hospital here only had two vials halfway to the other hospital i had died twice first time i died the emt brought me back but then i died again the second time i woke up and seen emt coming at me what the paddles to shock me back to life which he almost shocked himself when i asked him what he was doing then i realize my chest was hurting me he had been pounding on my chest to get my heart started back up again he had told me but during the time i was dead i thought i would just dreaming i still felt the pain and hurts not the physical hurts but the mental hurts thats what i learned it dont matter you still feel the mental hurts even after death keep in mind i still think about suicide but then i start to think about im still in pain even after death the best thing as find something you like to do and do it as long as its legal fill your days with activities so you dont have time to think even if it means doing it by yourself just dont stay and one spot and do nothing this is not going to stop it from happening but it will lessen the pain because if youre too busy doing something that can be enjoyable then you wont have time to think about the other things the key is to stay active and do it when you dont feel like doing it also keep in mind dont push too hard a little bit at a time will build you up then to try to do it all at once last time can be done with anxiety and panic attacks dont ever brush it or try to do it like others do it do it at your own pace so get active and stay active also keep in mind no one can make you do anything but nothing can be accomplished by doing nothing talk to who you can even if its only on the internet i hope and pray this can help you but its up to you to want to do it,0
i feel for you i can talk this way whenever you need please do not hesitate ok,0
it sounds like you may be lonely too try reaching out to someone to do something with work with your therapist to figure out why you are depressed and having anxiety you may want to go back to the hospital to get your meds changed up if you are feeling suicidal i have been through all of the above its constant work sometimes to feel good if i relax to long i back slide one of the biggest things for me is being happy with my self i am me and that is ok!! i have chronic mental heath issues i have chronic physical issues im shy my husband of 20 years dumped me for a new model but i am learning that i am much more than these things i have my good days and bad days i will forever be a work in progress i hope you are feeling better keep us up to date on how you are doing,0
dont give up keeping testing the right med combo for you keep working we have to work hard to identify our triggers and we learn a new one daily also i wanted to add a warningif your bipolar and your doctor advise anti depressants rather then anti anxiety find a new doc people anti depressants (for most) bipolar souls only increases depression and intensify anxiety the good doctors know this and keep up with the ever changing discovers in the brain thats the one you want to keep note disclaimer although it is my experience and the experience of many of the people i have met to have had adverse effects with anti depressants mostly paxil and prozac they may be beneficial for some listen to your doc find your zen when the dark creeps in music art writing coloring reading a book playing with you pet anything that you can put your hands on and zen out on,1
ill be honest with you until you tell the world and everyone in it to kiss your life will not change youll always feel insecure anxious silent afraid scared nonbelievable stuck ive been there it took me dying to live,0
this is my post i am so lost i feel like im going crazy and i feel like im losing it it is so scary i have been fighting the suicidal thoughts for so long i cant shake it,0
really sorry you are feeling so desperately unwell when suicidal thoughts are so persistent you may need to be in hospital for a while try to remember what has helped you improve in the past i wish you well and i am speaking from many years of mental illness,1
this happens all to frequently to me i know how frightening it isto wonder why this has to be youbut its not youand it will pass your smile will be back again keep pushing thru,0
im the only one that can save myselfand at times thats a struggle within myself ,0
it is when it is unpredictable how ur day is going to turn out xx i find it a struggle to get through life without feeling emotional ,0
that self doubt of judging whats "normal" really makes it harder on ourselves ,0
its terrible having both ive been struggling alone for years  im tired of it im so done  sick of hurting inside,0
every day i struggle with that,0
we arent alone although it feels that way because when suffering from this you can be with 1000 other people and it just doesnt matter im not afraid to admit it its not a flaw of character its a disease facebook is an outlet to purge the "shit" if you cant del with that unfriend me if you havent already lets see how many true friends that im left with;;;;;;;;;;;;,0
and you never know when the switch will happen so you stress knowing its going to come at some point,0
mike struggled and struggled like you i know thats why he gave up the ghost,0
wow! i hope everyone that knows me takes the time to really read and think about what you read this is what i struggle with on a daily basis however with the god and the wonderful support group i have it does make like alot easier,0
wake up from sleep cant move shaking crying/screaming scared to death sweating profusely not fun sometimes due to traumatic memories in night mares,0
terri ridlon please explain night terrors i think i have them thanks,0
i also have night terrors,1
i watch my daughter go through this and its the hardest thing a parent can do they tell me that you cant fix all the things wrong it sure hurts no insurance no medications just a day to day struggle,0
i dread these feelings that never returning back from that dark nightmare ,0
exactly the woman i love struggling with this i believe and doesnt believe i can handle it plus shes surrounded with manipulative shrews who lie for their own personal gain and she is too naive to see this truth,0
i dont suffer from bipolar but i suffer from anxiety which is a daily struggle which sometimes isnt pretty x,1
yelling is a part of verbal abuse and yes it most certainly will effect her confidence and self esteemseven is a bit young yet to explain disorders but if one day you were to have a mother/daughter moment say brushing her hair you could approach the subject and maybe also try to assure her that you will also try to think things through before you yellmy son had the same problem with mei am softspoken but when i get scared because i told him not to do something and he did it anyway boy that makes me madbut i want him to be confident to speak up so i promised i would try not to blow up but he had to do what i asked him to do,0
mummys hundred acre wood ur personality takes on different characters tigger is manic piglet is anxiety poo is foggy  owl is wise rabbit is high organisation (bipolar and i have bouts of this!!) roo is the curious part of u  etc give her something to relate to hubby n i have 7 kids this has worked from 3 up :),1
i think she is to young to know maybe in simpler terms say mummy gets tired if u try organise things better or relax more have some time to urself each day get a good sleep go for a msssage maybe then this will help you to be calmer im still struggling with most of these try see the difference between important things to be upset about and the not so important sometimes getting upset over smaller issues isnt worth it give her 5 mins to do something if she wants even if it is bedtime my daughter same age spend quality time together obviously u know irritability is part of the illness just control what u can breathe  im sure most of ur have this issue we coping with a lot esp with kids just make a few changes to help genetics is part of it but so is living environment make everything as nice as u can get her into good habits like tidying sleeping early this will help for future occasionally shouting not gona affect so much but be aware do what u can to reduce it x,0
i have had the conversation with my daughter with increasing details as she has grown mommy has a brain that doesnt think or work like others i take medicine to help me but i still will sometimes be overwhelmed this is the cause for my frustration and why i feel the need to yell it is to right to yell at you and i am very sorry i love you more than anyone on this earth and i am trying my best to be a better mother to you that is why i keep trying and sometimes it doesnt work it isnt your fault and it isnt right but i love you so much that i am doing everything i can to get help people arent perfect and parents are people too do you have any questions or what to tell me how you feel? that is more or less how it goesand at least having the information and the facts could help her i grew up not knowing why with my mother so i am trying to give her something she can be certain about,0
i worry about that too with my 1 and half year old everyday i know she isnt old enough but family therapy isnt a bad idea when she gets older the more she will understand but before i go off yelling i ask myself is what she doing age appropriate? (such as climbing on things ive told her not to exploring though mommys purse ect) then i verbally identify my feelings and where they are coming from ( i am frustrated because i feel like im not being heard) it helps me alot and gives me a moment to cool off and come back to reality that she is a toddler before causing damage of yelling,0
there are websites to help you find ways to talk to your kids when my daughter was 7 and my son was 11 i say down and explained the same thing to them children within this age range are very inquisitive and perceptive they understand a lot more now as their way of thinking is more logical and reflective you should start off by talking about mental illness in general explain that just like a person can get physically sick their mind can get sick too you can then explain what bpd is and how it affects you for example you could explain “borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that makes the parts of your mind responsible for emotions sick it stops you from being able to control your emotions which is why i am sometimes very angry sad frustrated or annoyed over little things that people normally feel just a tiny bit angry sad frustrated or annoyed over how i feel is no ones fault and i will get better so don’t worry” your child may feel the need to help you feel better let them know it is not their responsibility and that there are special doctors who will help you recover from this illness but you could also suggest a drawing from your child will make you feel good so they don’t feel so helpless,0
i have a ten year oldi had to tell her straight outi have bipolar 1ptsd and ocdi was also abused by an ex so every so often i have these nervous ticks and twitches she kept asking what was wrong with medont know if its right or not tell but i didnt know what else to do,0
you need to take care of yourself first with meds i know you dont mean it but it can be abusive and very confusing to a kid talk to her about the illness and get help my mom was bipolar which ruined my childhood and it still hurts 20 years after her death i will never forgive her for not taking the help when she was diagnosed,1
its better to be honest i thinksome type of person to guide you is a good idea i think 7 is a fine age as long as you speak 7 year oldthere are many uncomfortable things i had to explain to my kidsand not just about my mental illness im sure youve had to also i was a bit nervous when mental illness was the subjectbut realized it just like explaining other stuff be prepared for tons of questions or none at allya never knowi also found that even with a professional guiding me it was better that i did most of the talking only because if there were more questions they would not feel worried to ask me because the pro wasnt aroundthats just me tho itll be ok ,0
sorry also you dont have to go into the specifics or scary parts basic points of importance surrounding treatmentlikeletting her know you have a nice drhelping,0
im bipolar 1 have anxiety and bpd mum of 5 2 of which are step kids 3 my own mental health is triggered through trauma as a child i was abused physically mentally and sexually best thing to do is take your meds get a mood diary go to all appointments maybe get you psychiatrist to refer you in to classes which are absolutely fab ive done anxiety and coping skills ans have helped me so much if you ever need a chat feel free to pm me always be honest with you child though ive always spoke openly about my mental health to my babies so when my bad days come they understand its me and not them also family support makes it easier too xx,0
i spoke to my stepsons when youngest was 3 and again this year youngest age 4 i dont fully explain it but i told them sometimes i have trouble with my emotions and get really sad and cry a lot or angry and yell when you dont deserve it and i dont mean to do it and anytime that i do yell and they dont deserve it once ive calmed down i talk to them and apologize for my actions this has stopped them from getting as upset when i get like that (im rapid cycling bipolar no meds) when im sad they try to comfort me without being overbearing and if im really tired they will behave and let me nap on the couch (light sleeper) while they quietly play or watch a movie and they wake me if movie ends they are hungry or thirsty they are amazing at understanding how i am but ive also been in their lives from 6m and 18m respectively,0
single mother of an 8 yr old boy i deal with multiple mental health disabilities manic depressive disorder multiple anxiety disorders ptsd etcmy son has picked up my anxiety and he is in therapy just like mommy is he is also old enough for me to talk to him and explain that i am sick and its not his fault and never will be and that i dont want him to grow and have the issues that mommy has when hes older they may be children but they understand when its from the heart hang in there ,1
i agree with all the therapy responses but my personal opinion is i think 7 is still a bit young to try an explain a mental health condition before i snap on my kids i need remind myself to think through what is im about to yell about does it warrant raising my voice? what words to choose and how to convey them definitely consult a physician but i worry that my kids my blow off a scolding by chalking it up to depression and not taking me seriously when they really are in trouble,0
i disagree 7 is not to young my kids are amazing 161310 7 and they have always understood i have mental disorders in fact they are always there always understanding and have been the only ones in my life who are they dont take it personally when im irritable and yes i do try not to let that affect them,0
i have the same problem here i have anxiety and depression and i think i look for reasons to yell to help me cope better which is totally not fair to my 4 kids my kids are good i just get easily frustrated cuz my hubby can tone them out and i hear every little noise they make they argue with each other and they all think theyre the boss of each other tattling every 3 minutes it seems like i never get a moment to think i just want to scream so i do for silly things mostly i havent gone to a dr in a while cuz i dont want there criticism i guess im more ashamed of myself and when i talk about it it really hits home base and than the depression kicks in than im a mess its not a fun disorder and many dont understand,0
my daughter is 4 we talk about feelings we talk about mommy getting grumpy and "snapping" and how sometimes emotions are too big even for grown ups i may go off in the moment but its how you handle the aftermath that is important address it when you have an angry moment i explain fully why i yell sometimes im scared (for their safety) and yell to stop them from getting hurt sometimes i get so frustrated i laugh i explain that emotions are difficult and that my behavior isnt ok but we have to keep working on it and talking together all of that with my 4 year old she gets it when explained on her level (bipolar and anxiety disorder here btw) find a simple way to explain that sometimes you cant help your moods but you are working on it tell her to help if needed by maybe hugging you if she thinks you need it maybe an outside "warning flag" before you get too upset? it might help the biggest part is explaining that she is not the reason you are that way everyone is made differently and your brain is just a little different and thats ok ,1
also you occasionally yelling at her isnt going to cause her to have a mental illness she is at risk due to genetics also extreme trauma/abuse can cause mental illness so assuming youre not beating her or molesting her youre not going to cause her to suffer the same diseases she is at risk due to genetics but because youre knowledgeable youll know to look for the warning signs and know to get her help should she need it my parents were pretty perfect i have always been unconditionally loved and supported and i still ended up with bipolar and anxiety! so dont freak out about screwing your kid up a ton of therapists specialize in kids and can help her understand,1
yes if its often enough the child us feeling fear and distress then it absolutely is traumatizing her but there are solutions and ways to repair things,0
i have a 5 yr old and she kinda does the same thing and i hate to say it but i can scream at her and scare her but one day i sat her down and explained to her that mommy dont mean to scream at her like that my brain is messed up and i have to take medicine to help me be happy she kinda understands i think just kinda put it into words she will understand,0
see my kids know when im being serious and when im just being an irritable ass,0
i think she is worried about the bpd as it is developed through truamtic childhood speak with your child there is no too young,0
i stress about stress before theres even stress to stress about then i stress about stressing over stress that doesnt need to be stressed about its stressful and thats how every day is for me  i hate mental illness,0
this is how i feel and wish i didnt have to go through this i feel ashamed to be depressed sometimes,0
this is very true i also keep a lot of shit to myself because the ones that actually do give a fuck are far too precious to me to risk alienating them with my shit i live them so much i think they deserve better than my shit so we concentrate on something else and their awesomeness makes me forget about my shit,0
yes i talk to one person about everything and then i feel guilty like why am i talking about myself i shouldnt have said anything no one cares they think im stupid and then i just want to curl up and cry as my heart starts to sink xo,0
story of my life im done telling ppl about my pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow i feel inside nobody understands or takes me seriously  i always say suicide is my only option and i mean it feel so lonely and lost broken and alone  nothing to live for  feel like a worthless failure feel totally hopeless  cant deal with my intense depression and anxiety  feel like im in a nightmare  i know nobody cares so i keep so much inside and i hate it need to let it out tired of holding it in cant pretend to be happy  cant be strong anymore ready to give up,0
its the state you get yourself into that makes you want to do it then its the feeling that you become addicted to this is why the temptation is always there i recently told my psych that if they could create a pill that gives you the same feeling as when ive self harmed (cut) id be fixed! of course thats not true but it just proves what a desperate state you find yourself in to want to harm yourself in order to feel better i have resisted the temptation & not harmed myself for 2 months now & whenever i feel that temptation creeping in i call my best friend who knows how to talk me down,0
see this is exactly what id love to be able to do but my husband hates tattoos! i did go ahead & get one (by my brother) on my foot/ankle/just above ankle area once though without saying anything there are so many great ideas i have thought of but i doubt ill ever be able to do it as theyre grand ideas!,0
its a every day struggle,0

if only people knew the battle it is everyday to fight the anxiety to jump out of bed and smile when deep down your really struggling sometimes i feel best to pretend your over the top happy as it feels to me no one really cares hugs allxoxo,0
true only two times i avoided a depression that was coming for me was being marched for miles along the road and having a bath and my toddler popped a whole bottle of lavender oil in my bath it was very strong but i did not want to waste it it kept a depression away !!!,1
yep my life in a nutshell  im going thru this now and its getting bad again dont want to get out of bed lost interest cant concentrate  irritated all the time just want to cry a lot,0
had a dream so vivid i snapped selling my place bought beach place moving back to family town although im up n down ive used some healing n help from family n psychologist n im movin on its been really hard but ive got no options but to just try it it feels exciting but overwhelming sometimes its taken me 5yrs more im got energy n drive its positive so much gratitude for all this for me its a frikken bout time i could not focus on much ✌️ ,0
i left my job because i was just to tired in the morningits not like i sleep late or sleep to littleeven with 8 hours of sleep waking up for me is dreadful,1
this is so true i have been dreading mornings lately,0
dont agree with this i went back to school at 50 which was scary but took it a day at a time & i graduated your best is good enough!!!!,0
im not terrified of it being a possibility because i know its true,0
if you do you will never have learned from your struggles it is through suffering that true happiness is found take it from me ive been stable for 8 months never thought it possible to actually be happy if you fight and not give up it can happen for you too god bless you all,0
im a mom of three with differing diagnoses 1 no and1 anxiety disorder and 1 with borderline personality i love all 3 i see their struggles i would not trade my time with them for anything,0
its me too and i dont expect anyone to understand i always feel guilty for feeling this way but its not my fault its a no win situation ,0
they would be very concerned and frightened and surprised that my thoughts are so dark and negative and deep and deppresing,0
omg #shameless,0
horrible siesa,0
this describe me i struggle but never give up!,0
if an incurable disease has invaded your life refuse to let it touch your spirit your body can be severely afflicted and you may have a great struggle but if you keep trusting gods love your spirit will remain strong,0
so true for me anxiety and worries are an all day thing with me,0
thats me in a nutshell!! its scary and lonely i try to het out of it you know get outta my head but somehow i keep winding up right back in it,0
hi i dont know u but i totally understand and can relate  this is the story of my life i totally get not being able to function  cant function myself  been struggling since high school with anxiety and depression too  im also suicidal and a cutter  have been for years,0
oh my your pain comes through it is awful to hear the struggle you are experiencing it is clearly a half life you are living well not really living but merely existing if nothing now brings you pleasure unfortunately it sounds very familiar but it might not be any comfort to you that the feelings you are experiencing will resonate with so many people when you are going though such turmoil each day can be a nightmare day after day it is exhausting debilitating and so dreadfully unbearable no wonder you have had these thoughts that you cant go on you dont want to be here and just cant see anything ever improving its a viscous cycle of ruminating feeling alone abandoned desperate constantly miserable and not being able to see an end to it all when you need the strength drive and determination to beat this hideous illness those are the things which you often dont have please please dont give up hope your family need you and want you you expressed that your friends dont understand but you havent really totally opened up to your family? is this not something you could do to try to explain how bad things really are? it is very often the case we push our families away for many reasons but can they truly help and support if they dont really know? re the diagnosis medical appointments and medication the recent diagnosis is only the beginning with regards to those issues is there no ongoing support from those? im no expert but diagnosis in itself is surely of little help if there is nothing provided on the back of that? forgive me as i assume you might be in the us and im in the uk and clearly services are very different but diagnosis alone could make things worse in the short term without the follow up support as it might just leave you with so many unanswered questions? again re the medical apps and medication this all can be instrumental in providing a stable platform to build recovery if the meds arent right then it can be so much more difficult i often view medication as a necessary (in many cases) crutch to provide the stability to move forward you explained these appointments are expensive but what is the potential cost to you your family and your daughter if they are not working? once the medication is right the appointments then can hopefully lessen i really understand your pain having suffered previously for so long but i also know unfortunately the pain and carnage a suicide leaves behind when you are in the middle of the quagmire of severe depression we dont always rationally view everything so much can get obscured and we can make some terrible decisions my psychiatrist warned me against making any big decisions while i was suffering as we view the world very differently i put no more thought into buying a house than a loaf of bread nothing had any meaning it is so hard to see the wood for the trees (apologies for my english metaphors!) ive seen both sides i guess i know all too well the effect a suicide has on those close loved ones for a lifetime your parents and your daughter of course dont want to have to live with that im sure they all love you very much and would want to do all they could to help if they really could understand your pain im so sorry to run on and i also know it is far from easy but in short in the grand scheme of things i guess the cost of the appointments and the potential happy life you could have is worth the money there is a real chance of having a better future a chance to be happy post depression for me is the start of my new life my depression (well the last big one) was my previous life small achievable steps are possible but you need support and love care compassion be kind to yourself you deserve to beat this you all deserve a better life best wishes thinking of you x,0
ur not alone try stay strong be there heaps of time & its a bloody horrible feeling u have a very good reason 2 live ur daughter cause every child needs their mum & thanx 2 my daughter ive stop cutting & overdosing so plz 4 ur daughters sake hold on stay strong,0
dont worry you are not the only one going through this all my family does is being me down and husband is worse on friday after sleeping for a week i tryed to see how i can hang myself but i said to myself i am better than this i have to be strong and bring myself up and if you need a friend you have one here anytime ,0
u need to relax try rest have a massage if it continues see a doctor better that than it getting worse say you having trouble sleeping and relaxing quetiapine was v gd even in a small dose to be able to rest i tuk this after childbirth ask bout this what meds are you on dont worry sometimes it feels as if its too much and when u cant sleep you think its gona go into a relapse this happened many times to me it doesnt stop worrying try rest / put bad thoughts to one side,1
all i could say is i feel your pain i am bipolar and general anxiety disorder and depression iv suffering a lot lately my doctor just switched too im not use to my new doctor yet and he took me off my old meds ativan and oxycarbozapine i know ativan is addicting but it worked my anxiety is to bad with out it im now taking seraqual for sleep it makes me sleep nbut with side affects light headed dizzy and nauses and clonzapin for anxiety does not help to well hopefully he gets to no me and knows i dont abuse meds just take as needed and he will put me back on my old meds so i can feel better take care and hang in there,1
although its difficult for you with all the life stressors all at once you have to believe that everything changes  it will pass as it has before stay strong hope a little peace comes your way soon xx,0
praying for and all of us its scary especially when youre not on meds because of financial reasons or they dont believe you!,1
the good thing is you have survived through the darkness before now youre even stronger enough to get through this too i understand how hard it can be to be overwhelmed with too much emotions hold on tight and dont let it win over you,0
sometimes i get so tired it can be a daily struggle i have good days i never seem to be at my full potential,0
my mother is i have a cousin who is as well i was diagnosed with mdd major depressive disorder and anxiety but always wondered myself but also cant stand labels am who i am try not to let it define me as a person i would say my depression has severely gotten worse since my grandfather died in 2008 not only was he a grandfather he was like a dad i never had and a best friend all in one to this day i still have hard time getting through it and going on without him he was one of the very few relatives i was close to and seemed to genuinely care about me,0
yes! my father had manic depression in the 50s diagnosis and treatment was little he had no treatment and unfortunately turned to alcohol he went out and robbed a bank in a manic state got 10 years he committed suicide when i was 15 my mother had anxiety and depression tracing back to my family there were quite a few cases aswell i was diagnosed 12 years ago and after a few hospital stays i gratefully got the treatment i needed my daughter has inherited bipolar and is also under good care and treatment my phyciatrist is convinced it runs in families,1
nature/nurture? i can`t get a straight answer there is a gene associated with bipolar (bp1 i know so i assume bp2 too) if you have this gene it`s easily triggered some people without this gene can be thrown into mh issues if truama is severe enough i worry about my girls but (!) i know to watch for signs so i can catch it early & get them into treatment i`m always aware they are watching me & it helps me stick to my treatment plan i want them to see me be responsable about it so if they ever have to they will know how,0
i dont know about bipolar 2 but bipolar 1 is genetic and is usually brought out by either trauma or by your early 20s it is possible to pass it down if you are a carrier that is why i am scared of having a second child it sucks,1
my son had the genetic components but trauma (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified his doctors (neurologist genetics and physciatrist) have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense definitely can be a combination of the two,1
yes it is genetic but can also be triggered i also had trauma and was mis diagnosed with normal depression you dont have to have trauma to have it but that can trigger your bipolar it doesnt mean it will be passed down to your children it can skip generations i was worried about my kids but worry is just part of us anyway im open and honest to my kids about it so they understand it a bit more too hope this helps x,1
first off i want to admit im not a doctor and im ignorantok? why cant it be both? people having had trauma having babies and raising them will not be perfect or any person for that matter wouldnt their children be more susceptible genetically through trauma to be diagnosed dont make it more complicated than it needs to be theyre/you are hurt and need helpend of the story the question is irrelevantjust more anxiety,0
this is true my son had the genetic components but trauma (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified his doctors have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense definitely can be a combination ,1
i am 55 years old and both my children have high functioning depression i have thirteen siblings we suspect at least two have bi polar or depression we have lost contact with them my 12 year old neice has depression and anxiety,1
i believe it can be genetic it also can have nothing to do with genes genes only make part of your brain and generally how it works some of it is highly affected by the outer world and circumstances i know my father was likely bipolar and had a lot of the other diagnosis i have my mother has chronic situational depression (its easily triggered and close to being clinical she just doesnt talk about shit so i think if she did it would be considered clinical) my brother has severe anxiety and ocd and depression can be easily triggered for him i know later down our family line we likely have far more mental illnesses that arent mentioned at all but i know because i leaned so strongly towards my bipolar genes that i showed symptoms around 9 and got diagnosed officially at 13 which is practically unheard of (especially 12 years back) but it was obvious what the signs were most children under 16 arent ever diagnosed i was diagnosed at 11 with depression and put on useless (for me) and low dose anti-depressants at nine i was showing symptoms but easily lied about it and covered it up i have been doing ever since its become a habit and people ask me why i do it? and its like i dont remember how not to? so it honestly depends sometimes we are just dealt crap hands sometimes its passed down but its always hell and it makes us stronger than anyone can ever understand,0
bipolar is not traumatic disorder but truama can be a risk factor,1
theres some genetic components but ive watched documentaries and read books where they explain that people with the genetics can be non bipolar the gene can lie dormant in you and trauma or stress can trigger it,0
also id research that 30% thing that sounds like a random bs number its a crap shoot if your kids get it and ive always been told youre at a higher risk of getting it if it runs in your family so id say thats prob higher than 30% i may very much be wrong but i dont think they really know,0
i stopped my meds as soon as i found out i was pregnant but was contiously advised by psychiatrist and consultant to go back on mirtazapine i managed to stay off them until i was 22 weeks but i had to go back on them started at 15mg and built up to 45mg i really think i would have been in a really bad way post natal if i hadnt started back on them i was assured first trimester was the riskiest for meds xx,1
i was on bupropion seroquel hydroxyzine and lamotrigene while i was pregnant doctors wanted to taper and take me off of the seroquel because there was a risk of my daughter going into withdrawals i was unable to decrease let alone discontinue it but when she was born she had no side effects whatsoever i know there are risks taking any medication during pregnancy but the benefits vastly outweighed the negatives my daughter is fine and my postpartum under control but whatever you feel is right for you and your baby is what you should do,0
hello i am almost 9 months pregnant and i remained on wellbrutin 200mg i used to be on lithium and wellbrutin 400 mg i went to a high risk dr who specializes in these case  saw my therapist and my psych dr !!! i have had some bad low spots but i am very lucky that i am aware of it and i speak up right away and head straight to therapy ! i am also very lucky i have a great support system  i am nervous about when the baby comes out because i wanna breastfeed and i am not sure i can  but my mental health comes first,1
admitted to myself that i had a problem in my 3rd trimester of my second pregnancy and my doctor prescribed zoloft i had much better days no problems withdrawls or defects with my little one breastfeeding was not a problem either i wasnt diagnosed as bipolar 2 until a few months ago so idk how other meds may affect pregnancy your doctor will weigh the risks and benifits hope this helps ❤,1
hi and congratulations! my daughter is now 15 so i dont remember what i was on but whatever they were all the docs all agreed they were safe during pregnancy but not safe enough for breastfeeding that was sad for me but there is so much more to that little life youll soon forget that part my daughter was born extremely healthy but because of genetics just bc keep an eye/ear out for any signs of dpression anxiety bipolar (im sorry; i forget what you said you have) and if/when you notice anything get he/she help as soon as possible i had my daughter in to a therapist at age 5 like i said 15 now and still seeing someone and just this past week started celexa for anxiety and depression i am so so so sorry for the long message good luck!,1
if youre bipolar 1antidepressants will send you into a suicidal state of mind just be aware of that also research has proven that there is a higher probability that ssris and antipsychotic meds will effect your baby its a risk,1
zoloft/sertraline is one of the safest meds to be on during pregnancy i went back on it toward the end of my second pregnancy because my anxiety was getting bad again i was also very concerned about my baby having withdrawals etc i seem to remember my dr telling me anything under 100mg was negligible and the babies she had seen go through withdrawal after birth cried more for a day or two and then were fine breastfeeding wasnt an issue for me on the sertraline (off name for zoloft) i also breastfeed on psych meds with my first (cipralex) and everything was fine too again zoloft is one of the safest meds for pregnancy/breastfeeding something i want you to know before this baby comes: your cup needs to be full in order to pour into others (your babys) lives i have gone way too long trying to fill my family up from an empty cup and it does not work your health needs to come as a priority so that you can be as happy and healthy a mama as you can be good luck hun ,0
my doctors told me they wouldnt put me on meds when i was pregnant because the child could have withdrawls doc only gave me visterail to help my anxiety it didnt work just hang in there,1
*offers hugs* if you were doing okay on your meds before you became pregnant i dont think you should worry too much about changing them until a few months after the baby comes lets not forget that with pregnancy comes massive shifts in your bodies hormones that could easily account for the increase in bad days after your hormonal levels have returned to a somewhat normal rate then would be a good time to reassess your medication ,0
i didnt i had a miserable pregnancy and after got nasty postpartum depression which my family took advantage of and my aunt now has adopted my daughter cuz thats what they convinced me to do moral of the storyif u can find a medications that works for u and is safe for the baby take it!,1
if youre bipolar the zoloft wont help itll only hurt and i would suggest seeing a psychiatrist especially being pregnant medications are dangerous i understand treatment is crucial as im bipolar 2 with mixed features and severe anxiety i had to quit my treatment while pregnant and it was awful i wish you the best of luck mama no matter the direction you have to turn and congratulations!,1
im bipolar 2 and have a 20 week old baby when i fell pregnant i went to see my dr to talk about my med we had a really good chat and spoke about the risks i already had 2 children that needed me so i decided to continue to take my med! god for 5mths my mood was really not good i nearly got taken into hospital now 20 weeks on im so glad i stayed on my medmy little girl was fine there wasnt any problems with her at all im on 250mg quetiapine and 100mg sertraline no-one can make your mind up but you they are risks with all med good luck and best wishes xx,1
in the uk they like to put you on sertraline for depression when you find out youre pregnant as it has the least possible risks for baby during pregnancy and breastfeedingi was moved to it last year as my husband and i wanted to start trying for a baby by the time i fell pregnant this spring i was on 150mg per day decided to move down to 100mg as i felt well enough to do so but have the option to go back up if i really need to x,0
rest esp after childbirth v imp a good care plan i had epidural to reduce stress / pain and risk of relapse think that helped a lot  you need help with baby after delivery hospital should keep you in longer than normal and ask nurses to help at night or ur midwife can maybe medication is v imp after birth i tuk lithium and quetiapine to help relax that helped a lot sleep v imp but maybe ur diagnosis is different may need different meds but this helped me stay well ask someone to help with night feeds after and dont take on too much get help if you notice any symptoms,1
zoloft made me have suicidal thoughts and actions my doctor stopped it right away and i felt better almost immediately maybe talk to your doctor about stopping it? from what ive heard from some psychiatrists most individuals with bipolar disorder should not be put on antidepressants because they could make mania worse or trigger lowest of lows but hey im not a doctor that is just what ive hear from doctors whilst in treatment centers also i dont know exactly what your bipolar disorder experience is like its different for all of us right now you have two people to think about your unborn child which god bless him or her needs to be taken care of before and after birth and then there is you the primary part of the puzzle i say the primary part because without you being in right mind mentally it will affect you physically which in turn will god forbid affect that beautiful child as i write this i am trying to hold back tears because although i am not a mother i one day want to be one and what you are now going through i fear i will with my countless amounts of medications and questioning each day if i will be mentally stable enough or if my baby will be affect if i take meds but what you need to have right now and what ill need to have in the future is faith yes talk to your doctor about possibly getting off the zoloft because maybe its causing those bad thoughts and do the technical psychiatric part of the process but like they say there is science and then there is god i encourage you if you are a praying woman to pray on it especially when you get those thoughts he will listen do it for you do it for that blessed child all will be alright i promise you may god bless you both and your family take care love❤️ ,1
if taking a medication improves the quality of your life and sanity then you should take it especially with a low dosage you would be recommended to take most drs are against medications during pregnancy especially for mental issues they look at a chart and immediately insist it is a terrible idea if you or your doctor have any concerns a specialist will be likely recommended they have trained staff that measure and track all growth fluids etc regularly i lowered my dosages of some of my medications and immediately resumed the normal level after my child was born my child was healthy and i was better able to take care of her benefit vs risk if you are able to deal with your illness without medication then obviously do it but you do not have to suffer unnecessarily because of pressure or fear your child will not have withdrawals or lasting impacts from that - but the rammifications of discontinuing a medication pregnant can effect your ability to adequately care for and bond with your baby it isnt noble or more responsible or more natural or whatever kind of misinformation will say to suffer,1
when i decided i wanted to get pregnant i weaned myself off my antidepressant first i didnt risk it,0
i cant remember what i took but my kids were both fine i went off to breastfeed but couldnt do it i was so full of anxiety i stopped breastfeeding and went back on meds good luck you got this,1
in health care there is adage "when the benefits outweigh the risks; the risks are worth taking" only you can decide personally i would take the medication yes the baby might have health issues but you will be there to take care of your bundle of joy god bless and good luck!,1
i was on lamictal for my bipolar when i was pregnant my son cam out perfectly healthy but heres the thing my doctor gave me a choice and said my son could come out with a cleft lip so i went to an herbal drug store and started taking fish oil as it helps skin to grow and stay healthy and i also took omega3 for his brain activity and a few other herbal pills if you are unsure about your medications i would suggest taking over the counter pills like the fish oil and vitamin b helps with your moods too of course being bipolar and having depression it wont do as much as your meds will but maybe try n stay at the same dose and add vitamin b to it? best of luck to you and your little one!,1
i stop my medications as soon i found out i was pregant i didnt want to risk it & i just increased my therapy sessions,1
the only medicine i could take when i was pregnant was latuda and buspar neither did me any good i started before i was stayed on during miscarried my child still stayed on them and ended up in the hospital to be put on other meds i have bipolar anxiety ptsd and ocd and adhd tendencies by whatever tests that they put me through im not on generic topimax cymbalta trazidone and have to go to talk therapy every week and meet with psychiatrist every 4 weeks so??? depends on each persons individual chemistry to be honest and if you have any other health conditions as well,1
i was on zoloft most pregnancy with both of my boys they started me at 25 mg both times my last pregnancy i was at 100 mg by the time i gave birth neither boys had any side effects the only side effect my ob was worried about for baby was irritability for my son (had two different docs with my boys) after he was born neither of my boys had irritability i also breastfed both boys my oldest is adhd and has anxiety but there is a ton of mental illnesses on both sides i have bipolar disorder gad adhd and ptsd zoloft didnt work the greatest but it certainly helped take the edge off it is one of those things where you weigh risks to benefits i would do your research before you start a medication check the studies done on the medication yes you do need to think of baby first but stress isnt good on the baby either stress can have side effects on the baby too from short to long term effects if you do take a ssri be sure to watch out for mania/hypermania being on only an ssri can cause bouts of mania i am a type 1 but i didnt really have issues during pregnancy do what is best for you and baby whatever you decide is something that should be respected youre a wonderful mother everyone is different and deals with their mental illness differently,1
i took a low dose of celexa and everything was fine you have to be in a good state of mind! i think a low dose is fine you dont want to be miserable or stress the baby out with depression which can lead into worse things such as not eating and panic attacks increased heart rate or dehydration sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks if u need the medicine and its a small dose like it is i say its fine!,0
effexor the last trimester and for 2 years nursing325 mg he is fine and 13 nowhe didnt have any adhd or any other disorder the hormones really make depression and anxiety hard with my first i went free of medication but for my second baby i chose medication i was able to have some control over my depression and be more calm and present for my baby,1
i didnt take any meds while pregnant its 100% safer no worries about birth defects or anything for my babies,1
agreed! some people are so judgemental! i was on a low dose of celexa and everything was fine sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks i mean its be different if it was a class c medicine but she is on a low dose,0
i was on 100 mg of zoloft while pregnant its perfectly safe and ask for latuda its a medicine used to treat bipolar and its safe for pregnant and nursing mothers was pregnant with my son on both and nursed him on both they would want to reduce the zoloft at maybe 37 weeks so that your baby doesnt suffer from withdrawal he might be extra sleepy or fussy or a bit shaky as a result im actually pregnant right now too almost 5 months my psychiatrist has me on haldol its low risk for pregnancy it makes me really sleepy but i have almost no meltdowns anymore its the best medicine ive ever been on good luck mama and hugs!!! :),0
im currently 7 weeks pregnant and i stopped taking my zoloft i am struggling with my depression but i am trying to work through it i dont want to cause my baby any damage,1
i took latuda and buspar with my last pregnancy for bi-polar and anxiety latuda worked great but after i had my baby i started having a reaction to it this is my 2nd pregnancy and am only on buspar the other med lamictal which is okay for pregnancy i have a reaction to as well i do go to group 3 times a weel as well good luck,1
before i became pregnant i went to see a reproductive toxicologist because i was on effexor and didnt want any adverse affects to the baby he said that ssris and ssnris cause no more damage than the 3% chance of any birth defect in a normal pregnancy my son had no withdrawal symptoms and received my breast milk for seven months that had my medication in it as well mood stabilizers like depakote can cause birth defects maois can cause birth defects as well as anti psychotics you should not worry about zoloft the doctor said to me that its important to have a healthy mother you need to be eating and sleeping being suicidal is not healthy for a pregnancy be safe and be well and may you have a healthy baby,1
ive been trying to conceive for ages now im on zolfot 100mg and quitiapal 100mg at night and 25mg when required am i going to continue to struggle because of my meds????,0
i cant take antidepressants at all i have epilepsy so there are very few meds i can take but im on buspar for my anxiety and lamotragine for my bipolar i am also 9 months pregnant with my 4th kid being pregnant with all these problems is probably one of the worst feelings in the world you have your moments of happiness then severe depression for longer than the ups you have to fight each day to get through it im probably one of the few people on here who cant take anything really get yourself a strong circle of friends try working on new things to keep yourself busy worst case scenario try looking into more home remedies natural things like aromatherapy healing stones and crystals herbal teas stuff like that its working for me,1
depends on if the benefits outweigh the risks in my case they do,0
im bipolar 2 and i cant stop my meds so i have to accept that i wont have a second child anyway i just have to remember my last pregnancy and the first years of my sons life and i think its better this way i dontt want that my son suffer from ny illness (depression high anxiety etc) im not a doctor but my psychiatrist always told be that you cant take any meds when your pregnant i dont think you should take that risk good luck!,1
studies show children of women who suffered from depression (part of bipolar) during pregnancy are at risk for learning disabilities and mental health issues,1
this is what ive done with all three pregnancies i stop my meds cry all the time and try to deal with it then once baby is born go back on medication id hate to risk unintentionally​ hurting my baby by taking an antidepressant,1
i am bipolar 2 and a therapist currently on zoloft although you may continue with it throughout pregnancy remember that stress can also affect your pregnancy you need to be in the best state of mind for your baby try some yoga and definitely seeing a therapist regularly there are apps you could download like happify or fabulous even reaching out just like you did now is important keep you and your baby safe ask your doctor about natural alternatives whole foods has some i believe,1
wow rachel! it is good to listen to your doctors as the meds you were on might not have been ok while pregnant however to call the rest of us "dumb fucks" is out of line we all weighed the risk of our meds against the risk to the babys development there are meds your doctor could have switched you to that were safer telling someone to go unmedicated is like telling them it is ok to feel uncontrolled suicidal thoughts which puts them at a higher risk of death that it is never ok! we moms that took medication while pregnant and while nursing were putting our childs life first and ours to be able to be there for our child there are no "dumb fucks" here only educated moms,1
well ill listen to my drs they know more than any of you ive researched which are safe and which arent so to all of you on meds whilst pregnant i hope your happy with yourselves for putting your children at risks you stupid fucks,1
lithium isnt safe! my dr refused to use lithium while i was pregnant because of too many risks said if i wanted to go that direction i have to sign a waiver stating i know the risks because thats not something he practices i couldnt do it i understand being stable trust me its an everyday battle for everyone but never in a million years would i stay on treatment and risk the life of my child its a small window of time to not be on meds with the right support you can get through without meds you just have to know what support you really need and different meds do different things during different phases of pregnancy ive been on some that are safer after first trimester and ive been on some that were only safe during the first trimester,0
sometimes ppl need to be on medication and that is less risky often than having a relapse lithium safe after 26wks and other meds have a low risk of problem its 1st trimester when its imp to be off meds if possible/ advised although i was ok with out any,1
i didnt even know it was thought to be ok to continue psych meds while pregnant so when i decided to get pregnant i weaned myself off before i even started trying i wasnt going to risk something going wrong with my baby because of my meds,0
fortunately i wasnt on meds when i was pregnant i battle my disorders in silence i dont know if i am worth listening to but if you can hold off increasing the meds i think you should i know what your going thru to some degree and its definitely tough i have many disorders including bipolar there are many side affects that affect us let alone a baby i believe the meds could have some affect it would scare me i hope you find peace in whatever you do my prayers are with you god bless!!,1
i stopped all meds when i was pregnant then continued them after i had baby so i was not able to breastfeed and things were hard during my pregnancy but to me the bad days were worth knowing that i was doing what was best for my kids and not taking chances i understand why some women opt to stay on meds but for me it just wasnt a risk i was willing to take and while i had suicidal thoughts i knew that i never would act on them while i was pregnant so i just dealt with everything until baby was born and continued therapy,0
i was on pristiq for depression/anxiety my entire pregnancy and ended up going up dosage to 200mg/day the only issues bubba would have faced was possibly some lung issues but as long as they were aware of it they would be prepared to handle it he was born via c section 2 weeks early as he was 44kg/10p125o and i had a lot of fluid the biggest risk to his health was actually my gestational diabetes not my meds i was told that i would be able to breastfeed and stay on my meds and that would actually be beneficial to bubba as would reduce his withdrawal symptoms i made the decision myself to bottle feed i did try breast feeding initially but i think c section and being separated from him while he was in special care for 9 days didnt help while a small part of me missed bf you still get the closeness and contact while bottle feeding and it also allows your partner to have a hand in it too :) please talk to your gp/psych/obstetrics dr about possible side effects for you and bubba my drs keep talking about good outweighing risks at the end of the day it is how you feel too if you feel the anxiety of being on meds and possible risks will be worse for you than tell your drs that here if you need it mumma!,1
so you believe pregnant mothers who choose to take their doctors advice & stay on the minimum dose of meds that science & research has deemed safe to use will still have babies that are more likely to develop those disorders you mention? thats funny because i didnt drink any alcohol smoke take meds eat shellfish certain cheeses cuts of meats etc etc etc (whatever was popular at the time to not do & still constantly changes today) during all 3 of my pregnancies yet my 2 boys are both diagnosed with asd (autism spectrum disorder) adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) & gad (generalised anxiety disorder) & my daughter was diagnosed with add (attention deficit disorder) so there you go even mothers who think theyve done everything right still have special needs children! your ignorance is obviously bliss for you but for those who through no fault of their own are still giving birth to & raising special needs children its not so blissful want to know the actual truth? even science doesnt know how or can explain what causes such disorders!! so how can you think you have any idea?!!,1
studies show children of women who suffered from depression (part of bipolar) during pregnancy are at risk for learning disabilities and mental health issues,1
i was on 100 mg of zoloft my whole pregnancy i had a lot more appointments/ ultrasounds just to keep an eye out for anything bad(which i was fine) im also bipolar i cold turkey my xanax though (bc im diagnosed with anxiety) which was difficult but i was fine on my zoloft and they paid a lot of attention to me being pregnant on it as for the breast feeding i couldnt produce milk so i cant help you on that topic,1
amanda any baby can show those signs as each and every baby is as singular and individual as adults are research the hell out of the subject speak to multiple doctors specialists and make sure that you see a psychiatrist as opposed to a psychologist regarding medications - they are the ones who are trained in that area make sure that you know what can happen what a "safe" dose during pregnancy is and how to handle/what to do if your baby does have withdrawals etc though realistically if your baby is having withdrawals he/she will be staying in the hospital so that it can be managed in a safe and non-life threatening way just because someone else who has taken didnt have any issues it doesnt mean that you wont and vice versa only you know what is best for you and your baby however if you are having suicidal thoughts i would be inclined to stay on the zoloft and to increase as your psych deems fit you will have a whole team of doctors psych obgyns and perinatal/postnatal specialists looking after both you and your baby (pre and post birth) to ensure both of your safety and needs are taken care of have an in-depth discussion with your psych - write out any and all questions that you have before your next appointment and take that list with you so that you may address your concerns properly good luck sweetheart! ❤️xxx,1
i was worried when i first found out i quit zoloft cold turkey too and they made me go back on it they told me thats the first thing they normally put pregnant women on like i said they watched over me and i had a lot more appointments but she came out happy and healthy!!,0
eletric shock therapy it used to be popular till we finally got some effective drugs you lose some of your memory when they do it i talked to patients who underwent it when i was considering it i decided the risk was too great instead i flew from wa to ca to enter a hospital just for mental health there are a ton of facilities for alcoholics and drug abusers and not enough for mental health,1
im biploar 2 & i wouldnt touch psych meds while i was pregnant or breastfeeding i have a friend who is bipolar 1 & she had to come off meds under drs supervision with every pregnancy & just risk the moods she was advised to bottle feed in order to get back on her meds asap keep researching these are serious meds ,1
im taking 50mg of zoloft but i tried my hardest and waited until i was in the middle of my 2nd trimester where all his major organs were developed already it was really hard during the time i was off all medications but for me the benefits outweighed the risks sometimes it can do more damage if you are anxious and depressed best of luck xx,0
your not crazy at all infact you seem quite strong you no whats wrong and you want help to support you thats a strength my sweet you sound very much like me i have just got off pregabaling which makes my speech impaired n i cant hold a sentence at all n my friends and family look at me like im an idiot not thinking its just the meds but if truth be told its crippling me not having it right now i struggle every day waking up to crippling anxiety i swapped a med sertraline for esetalopram and it worked wonders but im struggling again just keep fighting for what you need n dont stop till you get it stay safe ,0
you dont sound crazy at all dont worry about sounding crazy,0
do you suffer from an anxiety disorder? i ask because if it a social thing then just remember to breathe and believe that yourself is good enough if you get panic attacks and such then u may want a low dose of an anxiety med but talk to your doctor about it if you have one and make sure not to mix with alcohol im always preached i suffer from anxiety and take 1mg of klonopin (i believe thats a low dose) good luck,1
do everything you fear even break the barriers,0
ive recently come home from 2 weeks in a psych hospital not a nice one but a super-max-type locked-down place with no civil rights you need it? you cant have it cause somebodys figured out how to turn it into a weapon or drugs i have ptsd night terrors and anxiey and depression they had to let me go before i was ready because a woman was trying to kill me and my pulse was so high they were afraid i would have a stroke why didnt they put her in a locked room? well because she had a right to be there so i am home withdrawing from effexor i only took it for 3 weeks before the edema hair loss vision changes heart rate changes etc till they believed me that it was killing me,1
everyday every hour is a struggle those who dont understand wont unless they try and educate themselves on the illness you think i we want to be this way? no manic depression anxiety bipolar 2 boarder line personality hell of a mixture you dont understand spend a hour in my shoes,0
i suffer from anxiety and depression its a everyday struggle to put on a fake smile! pretend to be a little happy so no one says wow shes a b:t($ bc most days thats how i feel like a grade a (b) bc im so done with people and their ways,0
most people are stupid most meople will never get it because they dont want to they have their heads buried because they are afraid,0
thanks for asking  cant even describe how intense my depression and anxiety and self hate is so very very strong  very overwhelming  still feel suicidal and hopeless still feel like giving up no matter how i try things wont get better i feel like no one understands  i cant be strong forever the pain hurt and sadness and sorrow and despair is so much to handle  unfortunately i have not had any improvement in how i feel i wish i did thanks a lot for checking in it means a lot that someone cares,0
its definitely a struggle that other ppl will never understand,0
its a battle i fight daily and people that dont have these disorders cant really understand its a very scary and lonely place to be,0
im fearful of a super-low next oh the joys of this disorder!,0
i wish people would take the time to learn about mental health if you have cancer everyone will help you and understand your problem learn about it and talk about it there is nothing to be ashamed of i will pray for everyone who is affected by this,0
living with bipolaranxiety and panic attacks,1
i can totally empathise it is heartbreaking seeing your child really struggling with life the only advice i can offer is no matter what make sure your lecturer in son knows you love and support him and will be there for him no matter what which is easy to day but not always easy to do my son went through extreme periods of aggression verbal and physical and said some incredibly hurtful things which i really struggled with but i tried to remember it wasnt him things are much better now but i still look out for the tell tale signs its vital that you have good support too,0
i have bipolar anxiety depression schizophrenia and adhd i was diagnosed when i was 23 yrs old im 46 now first idk who is saying smoke weed but grow up! second go for a walk i believe thats the most relaxing and calming for me no one is the same so try anything that takes your mind off things idc what it is writing drawing working gardening etc i think you get the idea i actually went thru a period of my younger life idk how old you are but again everyone is different mine was severe anxiety and depression and the adhd had a role also if youre just starting these symptoms now but i doubt it because i knew at age of 9 or 10 something wasnt right whatever happens at dr be honest thats the only way the doc can help if meds are prescribed take them some take a couple weeks to kick in others take 3-4 wks also if u have bad reactions and are worse or a reaction happens immediately tell doc im going to let you know you might not like this dr and he/she might dope u up i went thru literally up-to this day 32 drs took 7 years to get my right combo its going to-be tough but hang in there to this day even with meds i still have episodes very far between tho meds arent a cure theyre a part of your coping skills they are not are not a cure! when you find out what is actually going on do what youre supposed to do and keep doing it this also important you cant be comfortable with the dr get a new one you must be able to not be afraid to tell all that dr says no your ok time to get a new one if that dr says same maybe its something hormonal men get unbalanced also stay away from alcohol drugs etc they arent helping theyll make it worse god bless you and i know youll find that inner peace #livelovelaugh,1
sue youre exactly right this is why i say read up and get knowledge! jay and eric both need more knowledge on this thc is a good pain releaver and is proven weed is proven to cause anxiety paranoia and depression get your facts correct and until you both show me evidence from a source stop giving advice obviously you both know nothing about!,1
no read about it and weed causes in some paranoia and anxiety stop saying this im not trying to be a ass but stop ty,1
see a psychiatrist and try to get to the core of your anxiety she will probably want to see you regularly and prescribe anti anxiety meds,1
this is a symptom of anxiety refer to "the book" dsm-5 talk it over with your health professional,1
omg this has been happening to me too! my dr thought it was part of the anxiety and then it got worse and i was diagnosed with esophagitis,1
i have the same problem when im having an anxiety attack i go through the motions of throwing up usually nothing comes up unless i just ate im finally on clonidine klonopin and atarax havent had an episode since i have felt like i was going to have an anxiety attack i stave it off by lying down or talking myself through it or go to the bathroom and wait it out,0
i also do the gagging and throwing up when i have anxiety i try to ground myself and think of the positive stop it youre in my thoughts and prayers hugs peace ✌️,1
i had an issue with gagging/dry heaving i dont think it had to do with my anxiety though i just had a habit of making sure i always ate in the morning before takin my meds (lithium) so it wouldnt hurt my stomach as the few times i did make that mistake it wasnt a fun morning for me i think my body just kinda associated me not eating in the morning with my experience of takin meds without food and triggered a response even though i didnt actually take my meds never happens after i eat a good meal in the morning,1
could be meds or from anxiety try supplements that help calm like ashwaghanda,1
i have the same problems im thinking its worse when anxiety is high and meds im taking seraquel it seems to be making me sick with nausea and light headed and dizzyness gonna have the doctor take me off on the next appointment scared to just stop on my own and scared its somthing else wrong,1
i might just have to go in as a walk in which is a pain cause it takes a couple of hours atleast how long does the side affects last i cant handle too much longer need to find out if its the pill or scared its allergic reaction or some other illness,1
i have the same problem in the morning i gag and feel sick to my stomach i wish i knew why i mean is this part of anxiety?,0
wellbutrin is an upper made my anxiety kick into overdrive too often my bipolar is much more manic than depressive then the valium throws your body back the other way the body is constantly trying to find balance bc those 2 drugs together pull the body different ways,1
good luck just make your future the best you can i no its hard when you feel guilt from your past xxxx,0
welbutrine gave me panic attacks but we are all wired different,1
yikes! a lot of anti anxiety meds! i take wellbutrin in morning be careful with valium very addictive and dangerous my opinion so talk to your doctor about it❤️,1
are all you guys mostly based in america - its real hard getting medication off the drs here in england he put me on sertraline (200mg daily - off the books) and all it does is stop the hysterical crying i still have anxiety attacks i still go into mad rages still have days where i just want to be a million miles away from everyone still have the crazy dreams and i still have so much going on in life that i have to get through,0
ive been on 300mg lamictal for years and will never change from that the only thing i found that worked for me was seroquel xr along with due to depression and anxiety i use benedryl yo go to sleep every night im trying melatonin for something different lamictal at night also and that makes me groggy,1
my doctor used wellbutrin to bring me out of depression never for mania in fact she watches my dosage carefully so mania isnt triggered im bipolar one i use to be on lamictal for awhile it worked well i guess every doc has their way of doing the meds i just know if i get too much wellbutrin i become jiddery and anxious good luck,1
im on 300mg of wellbutrin 300 trazadone 20mg-3 times a day of buspar 1200mg of lithium 4 mg of proxasin( cant spell) so i honestly dont know whats working on whats not im a recovering drug addict/alcoholic so i cant take narcotics anymore i have cycothymia ptsd add generalized anxiety disorder i feel like im on too much shit but everyone is different and how they respond to meds its hard to really get advice on that topic i hope wellbutrin helps you going thru med changes and have mental health issues and dealing with the mental health world is shitty if you ask me im just trying to make it in life and keep fighting,0
oh bless you! im also a recovering alcoholic and drug addict no benzodiazepines for sure i too had to be weaned off xanax but like you not until i was well enough from alcohol ive been on many combinations of meds and the last 4 years the right ones for me im bipolar major depression catastrophic anxiety panicky etc but sober for 6 years!!!!,1
i am also a recovering alcoholic i have been on xanax for 23 years at this point only 8 weeks sober he does not want me to detox off this drug just yet i am also bi polar 2 ptsd anxiety,1
my history is very similar to yours the disease damaged your ability to manage your life properly not you per say i was told i am grieving the loss of who i was before this disease took hold i also take and anti seizure med tegretol which had helped immensely however i am also on valium for anxiety and sleep i also take ambien for sleep this med is the one that truly made a difference i have been on wellbutrin and buspar and sadly really never helped everyone needs their own specific "cocktail" to be effective i wish you all the best "if you find yourself in hell keep going"~winston churchill this quote has helped me laugh and to keep moving forward i wish the same for you!❣️,1
the only advice i have is watch for mania since you have just been manic antidepressants can cause mania im on wellbutrin 300mg and it works well for me but im bp2 i also take buspar 10mg three times a day for anxiety and in the past i have been on lamictal,1
its very dangerous to discuss medication with people who are not professionals but my two cents is that wellbutrin is either heaven or hell for me it was hell it gave me these episodes where it felt like my entire body was buzzing and crawling with ants or something and i couldnt sit still it was horrible but i have many customers for who it works very very well too,0
i dont want to sleep  see i got ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression for sleep im stuck sleep brings nightmares n night terrors when im awake i have flashbacks so im double fucked  then bi polar n anxiety n depression hits so thats a double wammy  no wonder theres times i just want to end it all but i keep fighting second by second so i can do it all over again to see another day  to start it all over again ,1
this  when youre scared to close your eyes at night  and when you open them the next morning you think oh shit not again,0
it can be so hard as the other post suggested they cant be pushed recovery from anxiety or depression can feel so painfully slow for the sufferer and those close to them i was in a similar position with a son the same age the most important thing i learned is for them is to know they can rely on you 100% not to push them too far too fast not to falter not to give up and to be there others come and go some dont understand this is where the loneliness can come in for them when they feel they are different not coping or when their friends dont have time for them when they feel they can t control the mental illness when it doesnt make sense when it takes over and they cant see it getting any better the one person they usually need to count on is their mum even though they are a young adult they are still young still vulnerable and still needing a huge amount of support gentle encouragement to move forward of course is necessary but it has really to be governed by them at the pace they feel comfortable with hopefully small achievable steps will lead on to more every achievement however small it might seem to others will hopefully spur them on drawing on past evidence to help them see they are doing well they are moving forward one particularly bad time with us was the eve of a big school trip early this year the first one in the whole of his schooling he felt able to go on at the last minute he couldnt go it was too big for him i tried everything in my power to convince him to go i thought it was time to throw in the towel i thought if he couldnt do that he d never be able to do anything he just said mum i need you to understand if i havent got you on my side ive got nothing it is just too big to do at this time please dont make me i quickly learned an important lesson at this point in his life it was too much for him to cope with he explained it didnt mean that sometime in the future he might feel strong enough hes gone on to secure a job recently which was beyond my wildest dreams i never thought it possible to overcome the anxiety of an interview anything is possible but of course its not easy mental illness is debilitating sometimes its heartbreaking to see a loved one go through it we can feel so powerless when as a parent we want to fix and protect the hardest thing is we cant always do that best wishes and good luck x apologies some of the punctuation on my ipad wont work,0
marilyn corrado sorry hun didnt mean to upset you but i also understand how emotional it all is and how big a toll it takes on us all your son sounds as though he has the best parents all we can do is try our best they will always know how much you have helped them we put our heart and soul into supporting our children regardless of age and yes as you say it can feel such a solitary journey sometimes but im sure as a family you are a strong unit and im sure you will all do your utmost to ensure he has a happy future stay strong hold on to your dreams x thank you for your kind words too ill walk over hot coals for my children the other one is profoundly deaf so they both still need a huge amount of support but we ll soldier on take good care of yourself too thats so important x,0
my husband had a very hard time excepting it we saw our other two sons thrive in life one has his phd and the other is a comic (who suffers from depression and anxiety but still can deal with it) after years of counseling his therapist said to home school him my husband said each day when we drove him to school was like taking him to a funeral he wanted so bad for him to be normal our son from day one was different from the other two do i want him to be normal yes do i want him to be happy yes do we all still have hope yes? but for now it is what it is and one day i hope there is a great advancement in drugs or treatment he is a wonderful caring young man and is willing to be a guinea pig he wants to get better he hopes he will get better but for now we just wait and live this way god bless,0
some heavy pain you are carrying there im going to try and respond to the aspects youve mentioned as best as i can firstly i dont think anybody here will ever say they know what you are going through we all know that every persons condition is different we might have similar diagnosis but how that condition affects you is not how it affects me friends and family who say this are most likely only trying to be there for you sadly it can feel as an insult but there is nothing you can do about other people with regards to your people pleasing behaviour well ive found that most of those suffering from a mental condition are in fact always people pleasers we give unconditionally to the point where it drains us its hard to focus only on yourself because you dont want to feel selfish take it from a person who used to be a doormat look after yourself and if you have time and energy you can see if you can help others lonely wanderer well i think it sums up many of us here our conditions trap us in our minds and its a lonely place personally i have no friends either this is by choice as i have certain expectations from anybody who wants to be in my close circle i dont trust easily due to the once bitten twice shy syndrome does it bother me? not in the least faith and belief yeah well what can i say for some it works personally i want to vomit in my mouth when people tell me to pray etc ive seen and experienced too much in my life to believe in anything that cannot be proven suicidal thoughts at are worst we all have to deal with them how you do that is up to you does it matter that others dont appreciate you dealing with it on your own? hell no if it works for you then they can go fly a kite do people care about your pain? maybe but at the end of the day most people are selfish and care about their own issues only we all get tired of fighting this endless battle in fact i have been stable for 4 years yet after almost dying last month coming home to the same shit i actually wished i never survived does it make me weak? no the fact that im still here means that im a tougher cookie than most people anyhoo i know i cant take the pain and frustration away from you but i hope that you will be able to see that even though we are all alone essentially we are also surrounded by millions who are fighting alongside us to survive through their pain,0
why take yourself off meds not every manic episode is a fun  you will crash and get sicker dont risk feeling stable,1
i know how u feel i feel like my meds are controlling my mania but because of that im just in a mildly depressed state all the time :( i hate it im so tired and unmotivated :( the problem is i go super paranoid and have to be hospitalized when the mania goes too far but yeah i would rather be manic than depressed any day the challenge is to find that healthy middle they call "normal" good luck congrats on getting back to work :) but please dont go off your meds keep working with your doctor and get counseling,0

you need to express how you feel to someone you trust let all that anger sadness etc out! with anxiety do some exercise i used to do this breathing technique when i had anxiety and it helped me out so much just take deep breaths in and out until you feel very relaxed it helps a lot i havent had anxiety for a long time(: depression was very hard for me i basically went through depression my whole life because of my parents go for long walks do all the things you love to do like sports or hobbies i hope this works out for you also know what triggers your anxiety so you can control them! if you ever get anxiety attacks do the breathing techniques!!! try to get it off your mind dont get frustrated if it doesnt work the first couple times i promise it will! dont go get therapy i did it and they dont even do anything they are just there to hear and thats it,1
dont stop ur meds you will go into a scary tail spin i know because ive done it b4 best wishes,0
even after years of dealing with depression most the time i dont realize my sleeping habits are an indication of depression i dont purposely do it i just end up sleeping --- a lot for example i thought i was over my recent bout and now ive done nothing but sleep for 3 days in a row honestly when i go through these phases for a week or so i just tell myself "im catching up in sleep" the good thing is its better then the flat out misery of staying awake through it during the day and dealing with it id much rather deal with this sort of depression at least i dont have to deal with any issues for a few days - a week u like most people my cycles are so insane i still dont recognize where im at most the time as i just try to discount my symptoms which i have gotten much better at the bad side is i get to where i tell myself i can go back to work for a few days a month make plans to do so then this shit starts back up unlike most people im the opposite summer months are worse for me then winter months still rapid cycle through both but more ups then down winter months glad these posts show up on my timeline i dont respond often but it seems helpful ones show up at least once a month ,0
this is our new normal float out in good time remember when you are down you can only remember the bad things when you are up and normal you only remember the normal times try not to get into manias look into peoples eyes and if they are looking horrified at your grandiose pressured speech give them some space seroquel is good to prevent manias cut your credit cards up to prevent spending sprees in manias and sort your money out that the rent and all costs are automatically paid each week with what is left over being accessible to spend,0
oh wow thank you so much kathy lilly for your encouragement im once again having to switch doctors my mine closed their practice sometimes i feel that my pcp does not take me seriously they have pushed me to another psychiatrist but my insurance doesnt cover in my area so now i have to worry about paying out of pocket its just crazy and i feel that there is no end to this my panic attacks had started getting better but now they are full blown again i dont understand this ive always been very intelligent outgoing and articular and now i dont feel it anymore i watched my mother suffer from mental disorders and i always vowed that i would not let my children see me go through something that like but the damn cycle continues,0
well my dear you are not alone! i have them all myself and often feel like a juggling act! all my kids and grandkids are grown so i dont have to worry about little ones i hate the manic state of the bi-polar depression sometimes i am there for a couple weeks i have been on mood stabilizers for a while now my dr increased my dose by 25 mg i could tell the difference within a week it is called lamactil stopped the hamster wheel in my brain was having horrible panic attacks so it helped that as well i would go from 1 extreme to another so maybe talk to your dr or psychiatrist! i take a lot of other meds relating to my other illneses had brain surgery and life has never been the same but know you are not alone out there my friend,0
i need some help my son has depression and anxiety and i really try to find him a good sleeping meds because hes didt sleep can evenone help,1
do you like animals they can really help if they get the up most trust with in you dogs and cats can tell when your upset if your in a apartment fed law prevents them from charging you or discrimination also volunteer can help,1
i try not to allow "emphasis on try" what others say or think about me because they are not contributing to my well being i have heard it all i just go on with my life my struggle & try to take one day at a time it is however unbelievable that there is still so much stigma still i really believe its more of a lack of empathy problem in our society,0
yes as someone struggling for years with untreated mental illness i agree that feeling like i have no purpose is one of the worst feelings  i totally struggle with my self hate depression and anxiety suicidal thoughts self harm insecurities hopelessness worthlessness etc  they all make me end up feeling so bad that i want to kill my self i feel like i have no meaning or purpose no reason to live  i totally get it it all makes perfect sense im tired of pretending to be strong  ready to give up im just saying your not alone  i feel this too,0
my mother has had quite the battle over the years struggling to find the right diagnosis and medications to help with them she lost my father and all five of her kids when we were growing up ( she also partook in drugs/alcohol so that didnt help matters) now im 29 and for the last decade or so ive been able to have a good relationship with her and shes a phenomenal grandmother to my boys she tried to takeher life many times as well in the past and much like yourself she was always saved (and sometimes just barely) i guess the point of all of this is to just let you know that it does get better you cant take away the past and any mistakes youve made but you do have the option for a brighter future! dont give up please your daughter still needs you no matter how old she may be right now and im sure there are many who love you despite your trials let the medicine help and find your voice with your doctors if they dont youve got this feel free to pm me if you ever want me to share more ❤,0
medication is trial and error and takes a bit to work out but once you get it and its good life is so much better hang in there and keep fighting i lost my husband and almost lost my son due to my bipolar depression and anxiety it has taken years months days and lots of fighting but i did it so can you youve got this!,1
no one told life would be easy but i know how you feel struggling your way back in is the hardest thing to do since you dont have any track of yourself anymore lets try our best to keep going in this cruel world were all here for you ,0
its all new too me and i struggle as well i try using comedy movies to distract,1
i also suffer from depression and anxiety and have suicidal thoughts and images sometimes daily i have tried to accept it is a part of me but i still have good days and bad days,1
i have both as well it really is shitty the doctors are right thats how were wired start a journal and each day keep track of your moods any suicidal ideation if you become obsessed with this go to hospital immediately,0
doctors are so full of shit its unbelievable they cant even dispence the right medicine get away from those negative quacks u are a hell of a lot better and sarter than they are listen to your heart not your mind i know ive been there and i hate it when all those thoughts come into my mind i shake it off breath deep and think of positive stuff it helps a lot than shitty doctors,1
i have both bpd and bipolar disorder 1 with psychotic features ptsd and ga i have struggled hard with suicidal ideation my psychiatrist has never told me i will always have those thoughts the last time i had a bad depression i was on the verge of becoming homeless i fought suicidal ideation for two months straight i even wrote a suicide note when i told my psychiatrist he didnt even bat an eye no med adjustment i had gotten through the crisis myself without going to hospital the thing is i completely was suicidal and it all hedged on if i could find a place to live or not i am disabled it was january i had just lost my van in the summer and was not moving by choice i have pets a mobility scooter and my son backed out of sharing a place with me at the last minute (i cant afford a place on my own i live in the third most expensive place to rent a one bedroom in canada) my daughter could only take me for two weeks or lose her rent subsidy and possibly get evicted so that was out i had nowhere to go i had been homeless before and i just didnt have the strength to do it again to lose everything again and end up in a tiny room without my pets was just too much for me i planned it of course the day i was to surrender my dog to a rescue i got the call that my now roommate and i were approved for a place i had planned on not waking up the next morning but i digress your therapist said you will always have those thoughts my psychiatrist never even addressed it and no i cant just get another doc theres a doctor shortage here people dont have doctors and are going to walk in clinics and the hospital because they have no doctor i dont think ill ever get past having those thoughts i just hope i never act on them this january was the closest ive been in several years to it,0
it does happenwith bipolar one you are more dangerous to yourself and could end up badly hurting yourself with bipolar two its more self harmbut with medication and alot of positive thoughts you can copejust tell yourself when you in a bad situation this is my sickness tomorrow i will wake up and feel betterits a roller coaster our ability to copebut as any sickness we have to learn to cope and be strongbe good to yourself find things u enjoy dont worry about the past and what hurt you or broke you just live each day as it comes and it will get better,0
i used to suffer multiple suicidal thoughts every single day for over 30years and sometimes i would act on them i am also borderline and bipolar with adhd since being on seroquel (quetiapine) i can go months without the thoughts and when i do get them they are only fleeting it has been pure bliss not having that daily struggle i still hate me but seroquel has been a godsend for alleviating those thoughts i also started lithium 4 months ago to help alleviate the ups n downs of bipolarso far so good,1
i think its a very hard thing to hear but its the truth  im not bipolar but i do struggle with intense depression and anxiety  i struggle daily with suicidal thoughts and wanting to cut myself  but at least a professional is telling u its normal instead of making you seem crasy like everyone makes me feel insane or dramatic i would love to find someone who will take me seriously and understand my pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow im very very suicidal but no one makes me feel ok about it,0
my counselor said that i am border personality threw me for a loop by umpteenth yrs of being told i am bipolar with anxiety tendency when i was told i was bordline personality with agroaphoic,1
seems a bit harsh to tell you youll always have them they may be part of who you are now but mental illness is a journey and you may experience changes for the better with practice and time that said emotions are never wrong they just are all you can do is choose whether or not you encourage a feeling by dwelling on it or choose to reevaluate your thought process and try to gain a different perspective suicidal thoughts are a reaction to difficult and painful feelings: you have the power to change how you react to your feelings even if you cant directly change the feeling itself your mind is plastic and regenerative thought patterns can become habitual but habits can be relearned,0
its the harsh truth for some people it makes the fight easier for others not so much if your therapist is a good one they told you for a reason for me personally knowing its just a part of my brain and not a part of who i am as a person was extremely helpful i know when to reach out when it gets too difficult to handle myself because i will always have them and thats okay better to learn how to handle it rather than making it a constant struggle to fix it,0
to be honest i would be relieved to hear this from a professional every time i have been open about these thoughts being my default i wake up with a hefty hospital bill i dont have any plans its just a part of my life that i deal with i cant tell you that youll always have these thoughts because i am not here to play armchair psychologist but maybe the finality of what the doctors are saying is disturbing to some dealing with bipolar and borderline is tough its work every single day of your life you are fighting i know i am some days it exhausts me so much that these thoughts resurface at the forefront of my mind but once again as long as i dont have a plan theyre not a cause for alarm to me personally,0
kristi dietz thank you so much for this comment we are not alone in this struggle bipolar disorder never gives me a rest and i think you put it best when you described how all its "a daily exhausting struggle talking yourself down or up all day long" were planners through and through haha,0
i agree with you instant inpatient its almost like my suicide ideation are one of my "coping skills" when shit gets super hard i have had them for 30 years sometimes i start to conjure up a plan but i also have a plan in place to stop planning im very organized in my planning lol but not really lol it is a daily exhausting struggle talking yourself down or up all day long sometimes you just feel like ugh this is ridiculous and you yearn for peace and rest how i perceive these "ideations" i just get sick of the fight i am tired wheres my easy button bc meds just take the edge off i would like pretty please and easy carefree day filled with magical mermaids and sweet tarts l,0
true but chances are higher if its always on the forefront of ones mind mine was like that i hit one stressful situation and attempted suicide im still so close to doing it again and it feels like i get even closer with each passing day i just want the thoughts to stop,0
i am tired i love my kids i love my grandkids but im tired tired of fighting its a losing battle everyday is a struggle scared who you going to piss off scared to open your mouth scared of what somebody might say about you its a losing battle im so tired of it all,0
my mania is not enjoyable its anger irritability a nd feeling like im just gonna completely go over the edge! its so horrible any body else experienced this?,0
i love it until i get irritable if i didnt have kids i wouldnt be on meds,0
i hope to have manic episodes because it makes me very active not need so much sleep and more obsessive (as in cleaning) i miss those episodes wish i knew how to trigger mine,1
i usually enjoy my manic phases during them im more social energetic and productive but afterwards i tend to be self conscious and anxious about the things i may have said or did,0
just came off of a 6 week episode of mania or hypomania whatever it is! i love it for all the same reasons we all do but know i cannot keep up with it all forever but sure wish i could! no fear of the world at all then i start to get irritated by everything under the sun & then the ugly depression comes i have many more episodes of depression than mania and would give anything for it to be reversed,0
i would always much rather be manic than depressive but when im manic im very irritable and honestly just a bitch but im trying my best to calmly tell myself im over reacting,0
manicdepressed paranoia psychosis i hate all of it doctor visits therapists 1:1 partial hospitalizations hospitalizations med changes provider changes costs for treatment and meds loss of all relationships isolation weight changes insomnia nonfunctional wrong diagnosis dual diagnosesim on the damn good ship lollipop,1
i enjoy that i feel more motivated and less numb but i also dread my more manic times because i make split second decisions and am often irrational and compulsive which has gotten me into trouble before,0
i like it but the irritability bothers me some and the cockyness of me not caring what my decisions do to my family bothers me but not enough to stop me doing it i live at the bottom of the wave so much that surfing the top right now i just want to ride and let loose i know ill crash bit until then surfs up,0
nope as much time as people like us spend self-loathing and wallowing in mental and emotional misery its nice to let loose and just do our own thing when our shitty-bo-gitty brains let us,0
i enjoy mine but it also scares the crap out of me especially knowing the crash is coming fast i between the times i dont sleep have great ideas get things done that have been looming for a long time i am also very defensive more combative and easily irritated and willing to act irrationally or run away,1
love the productive and creative side of mania  hate the irritability and conflict that it brings though,0
i take seroquel to stop the manias and lagactil which is an old drug epilim is better than lithium as it does not strain the kidneys,1
after reading this ian like this but my doc say i only have anxiety and depression i have highs and think nothing of doing anything and feel fab then the low when i dont want to speak to anyone and shut myself away i get in trouble at work and beacuse i do i think people are talking about me,0
that is pretty universal for at least part of the experience after a while being out of control can be very terrifying,0
mania is ok until i end up completely paranoid and psychotichearing voices and seeing things are not welcome additions to my mania,0
i dont because while at times it makes me feel confident and fantastic- at other times it makes me quite agitated and irritable and i can be hurtful when i am that type of manic,0
usually when i am manic is when i go into spiralling uncontrollable rages too not one thing fun about that either,0
i used to love it until they worked their way into crazy manias which got me into trouble or i dropped dramatically into suicidal lows suddenly or i went from manic to paranoid psychotic wondering what reality actually was yeah i had some manias which were just great fun very productive lots of energy creative positive about everything and everyone fun fun fun i did enjoy them a lot havent had a mania for 7 years now due to taking medication and i like stability a lot more the lows which followed were awful and im finally not seeming to have them anymore either (first few years of med no mania but lots of lows) manias were fun but personally i am liking stable a lot more :),1
i find it very stressful because my behavior during these times does not match who i really am i have tried conventional meds and am very resistant to them therefore i am no longer on anything i have lost people due to my behavior and i dont blame them doesnt mean they are better than me i take it as one can only take what i dish out for so long i have found and this is not for others to do without their doctors guidance is that i am better controlled without prescribed meds it does have its downfalls as in i am more isolated but i also dont make an ass of myself is this balance? probably not but it keeps me from taking people on my mental rollercoaster at least for now,1
its the most dangerous part of being bipolar you can bring it down and manage it with seroquel and lagactil and other medications its hard to control your self and you can loose a lot of friends great creativity but often it just feels like you are busy but you do not actually get anything done not that i have tried these drugs but i think its like being on lsd and cocaine at once yes we like it yes we manage it when you see that look of horror in other peoples eyes when you are talking to them with manic pressured speech give them some space and take a little extra medication to come down,0
i think most do however it gives me anxiety and i dont for the most part i have recurrent depression which is even more awful but with the meds im on i tolerate it and im well if i do the work to stay that way,1
i completely understand but hate the shame or embarrassment i feel after,0
everyones different i hate it i get aggressive and mean and grouchy and really anxious and thats not to mention all the stupid decisions i make like shopping and stuff,1
i enjoy being productive and more creative the feeling of not caring what others think is good too but i always fall back into depression before i can finish what i started i tend to have a million things going on at once and none of them complete when im feeling depressed all of that tends to make me feel overwhelmed guilty and disgusted with myself so its a toss up i only like being manic in the moment,0
i can see how it looks and i get down on myself when it happens but sometimes everything seems too heavy too much too overwhelming,0
i am so glad that you found a doctor that was willing to look more into things rather than just state that its a product of your mental health disorder i am really struggling with the medications that i am taking because it seems like a never ending cycle i know i need the meds to remain stable but i dont feel like i reached stability yet as my meds continue to be adjusted,1
thanks for sharing ive tried to over dose 3 times each time i felt so alone and it would never feel better praise god it did but it took changing meds support from friends and family and some time to let it happen im stable today and i have been for about 9 months im a little stressed now because we are changing a med because of weight gain i pray it works god bless you your doing great!!!,0
i suffered for years with an extremely low mood and had tried to kill myself on more than one occasion my thyroid was also out of range and despite supplements etc i ended up having my thyroid removed 2 years ago i now take thyroxine daily along with my meds for depression and anxiety the difference this has made to my low mood is dramatic dont get me wrong i still suffer with bouts of low mood but they are not as bad and are not all the time anymore please do not underestimate what a malfunctioning thyroid can do to your depression as the thyroid regulates an awful lot in your body stay strong and safe xx,1
thank you vicki early 2015 i tried a paleo diet to see if it helped my mood & i had amazing results until i had several stressful life events all around the same time & i crashed big time & just didnt get well because i was so unwell i stopped cooking & eating nutrient dense foods & juzt got sicker as im getting my energy back im back into cooking & doing really well on a paleo type diet i truly believe what we eat plays a huge role in mental health #foodasmedicine,0
i am just hanging in there minute by minutehoping this fear and these worries will go awayplease god help me,1
god dammit boogie no one wants to fuck pain well in inverseness they do figure out what works for you as a healing mechanism its here but to dwell on pain and it becomes your master and dominates your thought process is just patheticpain is part of life pain is not life part not whole excuse me ill be in my hole or whole or whatever,0
im currently on 45 mg of remeron along with 600mg seroquel i take both at night due to both inducing sleep i was diagnosed 22 years ago and have struggled to find the right meds for me to feel close to normal and function to the best of my ability ive been on seroquel for 9 years trying remeron was the best thing that has happened to me  ive been on the combo for almost 2 years and am happier than ive been on any other meds! and i was lucky enough not to experience the side effect of weight gain,1
never tried itdo any of you get nightmares that are so real?? im tortured by them to the fact that i jump up covered in sweat! and have to sit for a while look around me!! working out where i am!! then worry all day that maybe it was a premonition oooh awful xxxxb,0
still struggling nothing works i could just be a total piece of shit in reality- regardless of my medication,1
is it like a physical anxiety? jittery in legs or both legs and arms? may be youre suffering from the side effects of restless leg syndrome or akathesia call the doc right away,1
i take seroquel at night to help me sleep its been wonderful for my insomnia the first couple of months i had restless leg syndrome but that has tapered off,1
ya and it doesnt help my anxiety and panic attacks,1
seraqual makes me sick light headed and dizzy and nausea iv only been on it for about two months 100 milagrams i started geting a rash too so i started breaking it half i didnt just want to stop like that scared of withdrawls im waiting to go to the doc so i could stop takeing it but i need something else to take its place it sucks it makes me sleep good but its just too manny side affects,1
i realized this frame of life was stealing my joy i was too often living in an imaginary upsetting future,0
anxiety doesnt make you do anything you choose to react to it thusly it is you who made these choices i know because i have experienced all of this and more and changed it all too by choosing to be honest and realize i am in control at all times i am not a victim!,1
flipping right anxiety is bloody awfull!!!"i suffer from panic attacks they get so bad i cry coz im so scared of dien coz thats wat it feels like ye cant brethe properly,0
yup i had aasked my boyfriend the other day if he was getting tired of me my anxiety causes me to over think i wish it would let me be but no anxiety comes over and whispers in my ear im also afraid of losing him i love him so much,0
i get all shaky and hyperventilate,0
if you have never experienced anxiety - you will never "get it",0
true story!! others think you just stop because other people have "real" things to worry about,0
omg! i just love and thank you for this post i take depakot as well and my hair has falling out horribly i used to have real thick hair not so much anymore im going to talk to my doc about this sadly i might have to stay on it its part of my med combo a combo thats working for me right now and its hard to get me on a cocktail that works i have bipolar 1 thanks again for this post,1
i too experienced hair loss with depakote- what happened is it takes a while for the depakote to start the hair loss- doubt seriously it has anything to do with the name brand or the generic selenium is supposed to help decrease the hair loss but i found it continued unabated until i stopped the medication and my hair was never as thick again after the hair loss i kept the hair in a ziplock bag because i knew they doctors would just write it off- when i brought in a full bag of hair they could see why i was upset and requesting a medication change,1
some days can be a struggle,0
its a life of struggling but ive come far enough to learn how to enjoy and learn from my struggles and i have a couple friends that know me well and understand me assnd never have they given up on me that kind of support gets me thru a day also having adhd added to the list of my life makes some days go by thst i cant even remember em but i still love my life most of the time lol,0
i wish my family cared about me none of them talk to me because they think im crazy and should be in a home i have ptsd clinical depression and chronic anxiety and bipolar,0
no problem i know what its like to isolate n be alone n misunderstood i have bpd n am bipolar with anxiety and depression,1
latuda works great for my bipolar depression but i was having this problem in the night that kind of felt like restless legs but it was both my legs and arms and which i ended up with akathisia sorry not sure how to spell it i felt looking at up to give you an exact description of what akathisia is trauma it looks like youre having a seizure in your arms and legs where they felt absolutely horrible and i had to keep walking around and around and around well my arms and legs did these constant movements some kind of nerve disorder i believe is what they say if you know what i mean by restless legs and that you cannot even sit or lay down or even stand in place akathisia is 50 times worse so i would say yes try it if your doctor wants you to but as soon as you start if you start having those weird feelings in your arms and legs i would say stop immediately even though they always want you to wean yourself off and call your doctor immediately good luck!,0
it gave me severe anxiety/panic attacks if you have any side effects like this you can stop taking it immediately without issue,1
it gave me really restless legs had to stop taking it,1
altered my moods further rather than stabilizing them also made me restless at times and other times practically narcoleptic hated it and stopped after month im on lamictal now with the only real side effect being constant thirst,0
i accomplished more than i ever thought i wouldmanaged to work for about 45 yrs retired in 07 now i can take it slow & easy in my golden yearsbeen bi/polar since 92 im able to recognize triggers better today & free to live at my own paceim a recluse (happy recluse) dont have to battle each daywishing i was deadi pray to never have to live like that again cannot imagine how a young person can face their future with mental illness before their adult lives have hardly begun jesus is my closest friend todayive learned to lean on him & trust himeven when it seems hes not listening be patient he doesnt give us all the answers at once he wants us to realize that ultimately he is in control & will deliver us day by dayour suffering molds us into a different person eventually & gives us the strength we need to get through our darkest hours god bless you everyonealways take your meds & see your drpractice patiencetry your best to stay as calm as possible wtw = wait to worry,0
i worry about it too but i just have to remind myself that i am loved and can do anything i put my mind to,0

it is soooo hard to get the motivation started though the only way i get moving is when i have a dr appointment or a psych appointmenteven that is a struggle! my husband tries to help alot and can get me moving on occasion but i have gained almost double my weight since being on meds for 9 years changing them every so often but nothing seems to help!!! so i understand completely!!!!!,1
i feel exactly the same way! i am starting to experience some improvement since being started on the following medication regimen: lithium 600 mg per day lamotrigine 300 mg per day and bupropion xl 150 mg hang in there and try to keep the faith i have been fighting this horrible illness for 5 years i had several occasions where i wanted to give up but i have persevered you can too!,0
i feel the same way try to get out of bed no desire o do anything i know i need to get motivated but the depression and anxiety hurts i have been on every new drug that they have invented nothing brings me out of depression i have made some bad decisions that have made my depression better,1
im too anxious to use the phone at all,0
hey terra i suffer from bipolar and anxiety i did the ect treatments for a year and at the time i thought it was great it was worth the memory loss but i think it was just the break it gave me my head wasnt cloudy i could actually think and it felt good but like with meds it doesnt last and your left with the memory loss all i can tell you is keep fighting keep going to your doctors as much as it takes if you have to go to the hospital for a break it took 15 years of fighting and trying everything from meds to hospital stays to taking classes to realize im really not alone and to learn what i can do but im happy to say ive woni am down to one pill a day and i feel normal my memory is coming back and i have so much to live forlet your doctor tell you what he thinks you should do next thats what he is there forgood luck,0
honestly almost all of memory loss stems from my depression anxiety and ptsd im slightly better with my memory when on the right medication,1
im 40 with bpd bipolar depression anxiety etc i also lack the ability to recall most of my childhood n have problems maintaining thoughts at the age of 40 its depressing to have lived half your life n not remember most of it i wish so much that i could remember i dont think its worth your past i know i wish i had mine but thats just from someone who is very depressed with no memory,0
i am at the end stage of my bout now the last week i have driven myself and my boyfriend insane to such a point he was hurting because of my reaction i feel like a different person and i cannot stop it or be logical because there is no real reason for my own head just a guess a cycle going round and round until i crack i am going to doctors tomorrow as the pattern is formed and see it happening even before it started with that in mind if i see it unfolding why cant i stop it because its ruining all aspects of my life anxious afraid nervous my confidence my working life and my social life really need help im 37 now and feel stupid for feeling so pathetic my head is a horrible place to be in sometimes,0
it gets overwhelming and exhausting and theni still worry and have doubts,0
my husband just came off sort of accidentally he forgot to put them in his pill pack for about a week they were next on the elimination list and his doctor said not to worry about it since he wasnt experiencing any issues just proceed without them no issues,0
im sorry im giving up on myself and my life im sorry suicide is my only option left  im sorry im struggling sorry for being a worthless failure  sorry that i am going to leave you so soon sorry i have no more reasons to live,0
it scares me to be manic i feel like ive lost control of myself i dont know if that makes sense,0
or as my husband always tells me "dont worry cant figure out how to do that either,0
afraid if someone does this i may break down:(,1
dizziness zaps nausea irritable shaky and ill just kind of zone out here and there,0

this is going to sound harsh and me myself find it hard to deal with but we have something very not accepted wrong with us we dont deal well with things we seldom stay on our meds & really do they ever really work i think we all need to start trying to harden up why do we need the world to love us why do we think everyone doesnt like us i read the posts every day and we seem so lost and so needy why cant we just learn to live and let everyone else worry if they are good enough for us im truly sick of feeling like a victim or being victimized lets face it weve done some fd up stuff please lets all of us take a deep breath and appreciate that we can live just live xxx,0
i too have a 17 year old very friendly kindespecially to those in need before we got him the right help he was hospitalized multiple times during manic phases over three years he went from having hundreds of friends to having no friends because of his uncontrolled behavior once he was properly medicated he leveled out and has returned to his old self his friends never returned but he has a new hope it is nice to read the positive comments on this site i would just add that at 17your not alone there are others wishing they too had someone like you to talk too and relate keep up with your doc visits and medicine there are people out there waiting to become your friend,0
i dont have any friends i give up trying to have anyone understand what i am going through i do have dogs and they help with my stress and mood swings,0
same i just graduated high school which was hard for me due to many absenses cuz my anxiety and depression made it hard to get out of bed or concentrate my whole high school life (all of school actually) i had hardly any friends or they were just people to talk to about assignments no one knew about the real me tho idk how they didnt see my crumbling mental state the only way i got thru was my twin giving me love i didnt deserve and i told one of my trusted teachers when i was down my advice is to try to find an adult you trust and ask for support or forthwm to just listen my mom worked and i dont talk to my dad so i found a new father figure in my brother who helped me tons thru out my entire life you will make it youre also my there!❤️ i almost died junior year from one of many suicide tries and trust me this year will go by fast i care about you pls dont do anything tonight that will hurt you cuz i love you ❤️ you are so strong look how far youve come ❤️ keep your head above the waves beautiful❤️,0
listen to everyone on here who tells you they go through this/have gone through this too theyre not lying and look how many there are!! youll find your place i was so alone at 17 too only in my 30s did i meet my "tribe" of true friends until then i desperately tried to make people like me and made terrible relationship choices i wish id just spent that alone time being glorious "me" hang in there,0
the people at my church when i was in high school ignored me the other girls never knew what to say because they couldnt relate it was like i didnt exist youth group was awful the other girls could talk and cry and got listened to and hugged but no one ever said anything to me either there was an awkward silence or they would act like i hadnt said anything the leaders of the group basically said it was my own fault yeah good christians right? i dont even bother going to church anymore i dont have to be a church member to be a christian,0
friends should not make you feel terrible thats not a friend i dont know who that is but you should probably either tell them to knock it off or dump them from your life you do not need that "actual friends" dont walk away just because youre having issues thats not a good friend either they may need to set boundaries that are healthy and appropriate so they dont get overstressed or burned out dealing with your mood swings but they dont just walk away that will make you feel worse and it seems like you dont need to feel any worse your "actual" friendshave you tried reaching out to them again? apologizing and explaining where you are mentally? if theyre really your friends theyll come back to you as for your familydo you have grandparents a cousin or an aunt you can go to if your parents have walked away from you? are you getting therapy? if not you should definitely be doing that for yourself are you on any meds? if so stick with them if youre feeling worse on those medications do not be afraid to tell your therapist that they arent effective theres a lot of other meds they can try until you find something that helps with your depression and your anxiety rememberyoure only 17 you still have a long life ahead of you where you can make friends who will be there for you dont give up my best wishes are with you,0
sounds like my life all over ive lost people on the way and friends made some new friends that took me a lot of strength and courage and they stabbed me in my back because of my decisions in life and stupid choices i made but doesnt everyone ive currently left everything behind and moved with my bf and now im back to square one with no one at times it feels hard but really its so much easier less stress and problems life will get better you just need the right people in your life you live and you learn xx,0
i was on zoloft i was taken off of it i have ptsd bi polar severe anxiety severe depression i was put on seroqual lithium trazodon minipress cymbalta,1
im on zoloft which only took the edge off my depression and did nothing for my anxiety at all i was put on gabapentin for anxiety which does seem to help me but things didnt get "right" for me until they put me on wellbutrin (with zoloft & gabapentin at the same time) now i feel normallike i did before all the depression and anxiety hit me you just have to keep trying different meds until you find something that works for you im sorry that youre dealing with this :( its so hard sometimes,1
first of all i am so sorry for your loss and i am sending prayers <3 i take 100mgs of zoloft and it just feels "normal" for me i still get angry sad anxious etc i am also on 1mg of xanax i hope that you are ok <3,1
this is a true story i asked my older son to go to group therapy with me and he refused i need lee had a switch turn on in me and i chewed him out called him names told him he didnt care he was selfish conceded and told him never to call me again i feel bad now because i deleted his phone number from my phone book i have no way of getting ahold of him and i need to apologize to him i didnt mean it i dont know what happened im triggered this one off i got upset because i want him to know me and understand me and he doesnt want to and i was hurt so basically i run my older son all not intentionally he bought me necklaces for christmas the things i told him i was throwing them in the garbage i was terrible i dont know what to do i made a big mistake and i dont know how to correct it,0
baby i was catfished went so far as to pick out diamond rings & looking 4 million dollar homes once all fell apart due to chronic ongoing stress pressure & ptsd i downed a half bottle of sleep meds was dieing when a relative came into my room fig out what i had done & called 911 this was tues of this week call if you need to been here once before no one gets better without a lil support cant talk now have to crash but call tom we ll chat dear please try and sleep pray for you angi,1
i have a friend who has had a horrible experience using it i would investigate it thoroughly just sharing,0
i truly loved my cymbalta after it got added to my lyrica and lamictal after years of medication merry-go-round that combo was great the two were pretty ok together but after cymbalta got added in it really was a game changer i was on it for near a year with no real side effects other than a little bit of weight from the total combination i only went off to start a family my bipolar migraines fibromyalgia restless leg ptsd and gad were all responding and were in remission and well controlled it was a 3mo fight to get insurance to pay for it at the time though,0
their are a lot of coping skills you can use for anxiety and panic attacks that work you may want to try that route first i refuse to take anti-anxiety meds i take my other meds cause i had scans done on my brain amd we got to the root of my problem its a lot of work finding what works and doesnt i will never just "trust" a doctors choice for me i research your concerns are valid,1
im so glad that you came through your surgery it must have been a very traumatic time for you i also wish your health issues were better for you since your surgery im sorry i cannot offer you any personal experience with cymbalta as ive never taken it if you have trust in your doctor though & he/she feels it will help you maybe you should give it a try? i guess that unless you try it you wont know any different right? can i please ask you a question though? do you feel that your hysterectomy has directly affected your anxiety & depression or do you feel your ongoing health issues are more to blame? i ask this as i cannot take the contraceptive pill to stop my periods & because the hormones produced during directly affect my bipolar in the worst way my doctors & i are now looking into other avenues to stop my periods or lessen their impact these include going onto hrt taking oestrogen during periods or having a total hysterectomy including ovaries removed which as you would be aware also involves hrt i have no idea which method will work but i do know that something has to be done as that time of month is without doubt my absolute most dangerous period (i am most likely to self harm or suffer such debilitating depression etc that i have very real suicidal idealisations & have attempted in the past as a result) any advice or information you can give me about your experience would be very much appreciated i have an appointment next week to find out what the best plan of action my gp & psych have come up with as they planned to speak about this before the appointment i have a close friend who has suffered anxiety for many years but after she was forced (for other medical reasons) to have a hysterectomy she has found that the severity of her anxiety symptoms have lessened significantly compared to before the surgery as you could imagine im very anxious & confused as to what to do,1
melissa mayes thank you for telling me your story & for your thoughts & prayers i will find out on wednesday what my doctor feels is the best way forward but i do know that i have only 3 options as i mentioned above which involve either taking oestrogen during my periods going onto hrt or lastly a full hysterectomy (including the ovaries) then hrt id be a fool if i didnt admit that im scared but i do know that something has to be done i cannot continue this way,0
a close friend was prescribed cymbalta for depression & she got some uncomfortable side effects for the first few days so she ceased the medication the dr told her that was quite common & would probably have subsided within the week,0
i have been on cymbalta for three years i actually feel great the drawbacks however are the side effects i am experiencing it is apparently affecting my nervous system which makes me sweat a lot and i mean a lot! i am a health care aide and i sweat so badly at work that my scrub top is soaked within an hour into my shift its not a common side effect however i am just unfortunate to experience it i just lowered my dose which was hard due to the side effects of that the sweating has improved minimally if at all i hope this helps! feel free to message me if you want to chat more!,0
i have heard horrible experiences,0
well i take cymbalta i used to be on zoloft and now i take cymbalta and it kind of makes me feel like im on cruise control i dont get upset i dont get angry helps my depression a whole lot and ill try to go off of it several times but everytime i do my depression always comes back and its a lot worse people can always tell thats around me that im not taking my medicine so i take the generic brand i get it from kentucky and i get mine for $21 for a 90 day supply,0
they just prescribed me that and im scared to take any kind of medicine because they gave me prozac two weeks ago and it brought on my depression and suicidal thoughts so i had to stop it!,1
thanks everyone for the feeedback i know that some ppl are against medications but some ppl just have to have them i have also been on klonopin for years for my anxiety attacks i have been through a very big ordeal i cannot even remember being in the hospital or what even happened to me i dont even remember my friends and family even coming to visit me i have had a very deep depression and that is just not me i have to at least try something to see if it works my doctor says the patience that he has on the medicine has had a very good success rate with it i also have pain and i understand that it is used for pain as well and as far as giving it to god that so have done i pray about my life and my lifes situations quite often imagine going in for a simple procedure and ending up in icu on an intebator and then coming out with over 100k dollars in hospital and doctor bills to boot! this had also effected my marriage and i just got married last october so if i have to try a medication for my depression hell its at least worth a try i just hate side effects but i understand thats a risk with any medication,0
paula santana so many cooks in the kitchen! i appreciate that people care but it can all be so muddled if a year or whenever from now you do decide to come off do the 7 a day method: take seven of those tiny beads out of the pill day one & two then 14 the next two then 21you get the idea it was tough but i was able to do it (note: im back on it after trial & error and a horrid hellacious divorce) good luck!,0
you asked about cymbalta & everyone gives you all this other advice bless themanywaycymbalta has helped me a lot be aware however that coming off of is horrid ive never done hard drugs but it was what i imagined it was like to come off heroin and anyone else who has come off it can tell you the same this also means that if i miss a dose i feel it (brain zaps nausea faint) best of luck to you!! may you feel better very soon,0
unfortunately some times its the only way chin up things will get better talk about ptsd meds there a blood pressure med helps sometimes,1
prayer about how you are feeling really helped me and reading the bible psalms are good to read through lifes ups and deep downs david went through horrible traumas and he kept on believing and praying to and trusting in god it helps us to do so too the gospels especially the book of john is really gods love letter to us sent through jesus,0
i agree with eric that it is difficult to get off clonipin if felt like i needed more and more till i was taking 3 mg a day it took me 7 months to reduce the dose to 1/2 a mg in the morning my dad recently passed away so i went back up on the dose but am now weaning my self off it again do we ever not need a crutch in times of high anxiety? i dont know how "normal" people do it,0
oh i know eric grace i was on xanax for years and years and was put on klonopin instead it helps alot with my anxiety though and it helps me sleep at night,1
you have had a traumatic experience and there is another way to look at it you can choose to reframe it and give thanks for your survival you can thank the lord for surviving and come to him for healing you may need the meds to help you get through it but time passes i can only say this because i had some pretty bad things happen to me that made me really anxious with panic attacks and sky high generalized anxiety that made it really hard to work and do just about everything i really wish i had taken meds a lot earlier in my life while time goes on you do heal when i was at my worse i had a saying that i told myself i used to tell myself that "things would not always be this way" and that "tomorrow was another day! " i liked another saying that was " every day is a new beginning" this gave me the knowledge that as bad as a day got i could hope for better tomorrows,0
cymbalta was hell for me increases anxiety times a million body aches very panicky tried giving it a chance to work but it didnt and coming off of it was worse after a few days off of it i felt so relieved and much better ive heard the opposite for other people- some say its great ,0
the different types of cannabis work for different ailments indica sativa hybrids etc have to do your research i have used it for anxiety (indica) i do not use sativas cause they can make me have panic attacks hybrids are the varieties thats when you need to know names of cannabis and what they do to your mind body i take psych meds but have decreased so much that i rely on cannabis for pain management as well,1
cymbalta helps with my anxiety aches n pains and depression i wish you well,1
i was never a fan of linkin park but i am disgusted by all of the negative posts ive been seeing concerning his suicide its indicative of how little people understand about depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts,0
things will change / get better maybe the medication takes time try rest/ do things you enjoy when you feel up to it stay away from stress/ stressful ppl as much as possible do a little more each day i know its hard but many of us have been through similar stuff so you have to remember things will get beta pray to god if you want x,0
i dont know what to tell you and where i get this energy to get up for my bed also i have bipolar disorder fibromyalgia dislocated disc hernia disc major depression and more and more and today and all the time feel the same way im tired of dealing with medication when my two kids my adult and my 11 year old child they not very affectional kids and they stressing me to kill me because they very disrespectful but they dont grow up in the street they grew up really good after they being a teenager my daughter change completely with me she fall in love for a team and now she has somebody else because the first relationship didnt work and she pushing me away for her in my son hes adhd and autism but this kid is chase remind me all the headaches that i pass with my daughter these kids dont respect me at all i go to 101 3rd place for me to take my medicine every day i take him to therapies he take his meds he goes to school he goes to after school i dont know what else to do i happy for coming home he dont want nobody home just to be verbally abusing me and hurting me its not easy but you know what everyday wake up i dont even know why just to smile to everyone of my community but its not easy im in new shoes we do understand when we have four we have not everyone understand us the pain is so crazy with the fibromyalgia there is not even funny its something real real painful that im sick about it to be honest with you im planning how to go away from this world because its really painful and i feel very alone im only go outside just to shop clothes that i dont even use and i dont see the point to be in this world but im not telling you to do nothing wrong just go and get some new medication it takes me almost 17 years for have the right mets,0
to me i would get your medication adjusted ive been through the same with depression and anxiety i really hope you make it through!!,1
dianne guilloty is there any crisis help available where you are? please please reach out there must be professionals who can help your children need you so much im sure your loved ones need you do they realise how bad things are for you? i remember feeling that i couldnt go on that i needed an escape from the torment but its not the answer there is a better way its just finding the way i know how dire and hideous it can be craving an escape from the daily misery it can get better but you have to lean on those who love you and let people help are there any services available to you? x,0
i think hospitalization might help the most right now if youre able to do it the length of time probably would be determined by the doctors/medical staff because of what youre experiencing right now and i know that might be scary; it would be for me i really encourage you to go immediately i dont want you to hurt yourself anymore; its not fair for you to be hurting this much im really proud of you for reaching out like this youre better than this pain; you deserve so much more ill be thinking about you and sending good/warm thoughts your way go now sweetheart im keeping you in my ,0
i know exactly how you feel i was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago but suffered from depression/anxiety for years before that im also very lonely as when you cant work for more years than you care to remember the friends you thought would always stand by you move on and dont care about you anymore i understand to a certain extent but surely the odd phone call wouldnt hurt but know i consider myself to be a decent caring person and would never do that to them just a phone call but i dont even know a few of there numbers and they dont seem to want to give me them even if ive asked on xmas cards im not out to ruin there lives and i know i should move on but its a lonely life when for a while ive been in and out of the local psychiatric hospital maybe they dont want to be associated with mental health but maybe one day you just dont know it could happen to them i think ive made friends from hospital but they dont keep in touch either i know they are ill too but if youre kind hearted ive been taken for a mug quite a few times eg lending money you never get back having jewellery stolen and trusting an alcoholic who charmed me to the tune £4000 yes i got to like him even although im a married woman but my husband is not cuddly or complementary and this guy knew how to get me to furnish his house buy clothes cigarettes and even a washing machine there was no sexual relationship but if hed wanted to i think id have been up for it and i know that seems terrible as ive been married for 34 years but we were going through a bad patch eventually he didnt get in touch and like a little boy was scared he had a girl friend what i hated most was the way he lied to me texting me saying we must go out for dinner me paying of course when he had no intention of meeting me i was really hurt and even now my marriage isnt a bed of roses as he lost his job and 8 months later is still looking so you can imagine the atmosphere in the house also we dont have much in common apart from 2 lovely children there is hardly any conversation now i know a lot of you would say split up and many times i want to but ive never lived on my own ever and dont think iam strong enough to go through with it not sure what will happen but just have to put up with it for now sorry for the rant but apart from the samaritans this helps me get it out of my system for a little while x,0
i think the majority of us with bpd self isolate sometimes it is just easier than going out and feeling anti social on top of that we wanna go out really bad but cant because the pressure is too great if you need anything im pretty sure the group members whould be able to help just knowing you arent alone we are fighting the fight right along with you!,0
awwww its a horrid feeling ive been like it myself for a couple of weeks i wanted to be on my own tonight but my hubbie said we must have our friends round it did turn into a good nit and we all had a good laugh i feel much better now  sometimes we have to trust that our dear friends and family are there for us no matter what dont hide away think positive things before you sleep too xxx,0
as u can see we all go thru this i have bpd anxiety & panic attacks i lost my 28 year old son it magnified it all for me i stayed in bed for a year attempted suicide 3 xs my 1 other son busted my door down & told me uve always been the strongest woman ive known its not fair that i lost my brother & my mom the same day i felt like i was letting him down like i did rob i didnt right away just jump out of bed it was a long process but it starts with 1 small step i wish u the best & hope u hear all of us ur not alone,0
i hope youre in therapy for bpd i know someone very close to me who has this diagnosis and its absolutely awful for them without their therapy with their therapy theyre doing a lot better and theyre happier generally theyre using dbt dbt has some positive results for people with bpd if you are in therapy for it already it may take some time before you see good results just dont give up on itor on yourself! you said you push everyone away but that youre extremely lonely have you tried being honest with the people in your life? tell them your diagnosis and what that meansand that you do want them in your life you need them but youre afraid of being betrayed hurt let down abandoned or whatever other issue you may be feeling? im willing to bet that some of them would try to understand and be more likely to help you with your concerns people who care for you and love you will try to be there for you you just have to let them my best wishes are with you please dont give up,0
hi there sounds as tho things are really pretty bad for you at the moment it must be so tough there are so many hideous feelings having a mental illness can bring but one of them the incessant worrying ruminating analysing must be one of the worst it never seems to stop unless you are lucky enough to have the respite of sleep if it comes the torment can feel so great it can be exhausting all encompassing and at times debilitating having anxiety and depression can often go hand in hand as one can bring on or worsen the other pushing people away can be for many reasons as you suggest but of course it can also be counter productive having a mental health problem can make you feel very alone and when you need people the most you can go to any lengths to almost hide from people these might all be very common traits but knowing that might not actually help of course you describe that you have been recently diagnosed as having bipolar but im wondering if you have any further support (professional) in light of this diagnosis have you been prescribed any medication to help or do you have access to any other support eg charities counselling etc? you have clearly been suffering a long time so it worries me in case you arent getting the best help but am unsure where you are and therefore which help might be out there in the uk the samaritans are a very good point of contact for support but not sure if you are in the us its a good thing you have reached out here and there are many caring soles here who understand understanding kindness and consideration can really make the difference when you feel so alone take good care of yourself try to reach out to those who you love x,0
keep trying you will find the job that is perfect for you i forced my last job and i was miserable major pannic attacks crying in my car before i go in crying when i get out  this job will wok,1
screw her! what she said was extremely demeaning and totally inappropriate i am experiencing a very similar situation the onset of my illness was 2012 i too have a 4yr college degree my employer told me that they needed to let me go after my husband and i informed my nurse manager that i had been recently diagnosed w/ bipolar i had worked there for 195 yrs and helped the hospital achieve certification as a primary stroke center based on strive guidelines published by the american stroke association i was finally approved for ss disability in 2015 my condition is starting to improve gradually so i am considering re-entering the workforce however i am very nervous regarding the ramifications of that decision does anybody have any suggestions based on a similar experience?,0
go back and prove her and everyone else who doubts you wrong! dont quit on something you want to do you are not a failure,0
go see panic! in concert?,0
if i cant sleep i put the light on not because im afraid of the dark but because then i see the real word and not whats rattling around in my head ,0
for some reason the cold helps with my anxiety? thats all i know anyone feel this way as well ?,1
the sound would drive me insane shame a breeze is refreshing,0
i wish i could sleep with a fan on but the noise of it annoys mei need total silence&darkness for me to fall asleepvery seldom do i have my window open id have it open but im paranoid when it isits along story,0
check your blood pressure,0
i have a constant ringing in my right ear so and if its completely silent the ring is very loud and drives me crazy so i doubt this hypothesis,1
dude major time because you want all the pain for yourself you want to hold them up so high that nothing can ever harm them ever again but all you can do is love them reassure them and make the shop of horrors as bareable as possible it is very difficult though i dont believe its impossible,0
it is a cruelier disease than any physcial one if people see a broken limb or a disabilty that is visably seen they believe the person is in pain bi polar comes in all forms mild to severe my wife as it mild with other health issues and everyday she as to get up and paint on that smile for the sake of our son he is only reason why she does exist as she tells me it is a scary thing to live with and you feel helpless but you do what you can to support the person and hope others in their life do  trouble is my wife gives 100 per cent of herself into all her relationships and we all abuse her kind good nature and when she gets ill or angry where are we still expecting for her to be supporting us we the selfish ones when she does breakdown no one calls no one stops and values her me included and why should she put up with it like all bi polar sufferers she wants people who are geninune in her life and wont pretend or lie to hershe as the guts to do this so why cant we all be like it for her?,0
very true we have a daughter with bipolar 2 and addiction 15 yrs of crisis moments relapse and rehabs loads of worry and post traumatic stress type phone calls grieving the child we thought we new the lovely young talented woman who we had such great hopes forthe greatest sadness of my life i am thankful for ala-non support,0
i can say that i absolutely do not believe i ever wouldve made it this far nor been able to battle my darkness if i hadnt had you to help push me thru i dont think i wouldve been able to remind myself of why i am worthy of living why i must fight whats within bcuz of the desperation of wanting to not feel or to hurt no more  it would be more than i can overcome alone you absolutely are my lighthouse i pray your light never burns out bcuz if so i just might finally lose myself in the darkness when i pray at night i always thank god for you first! you may not know exactly what you mean to my life but youre the one in my corner that is there to dry the tears and bandage me up you encourage me to fight another round when i feel my life is being sucked outta me you are the difference between life and death for me i love you more than i am capable of showing ❤️ jason cohee,0
there you go derek pritchard its a horrible job in the mist of the thunderstorm but if not for the lighthouse how could i ever navigate through the seai never learned astrology,0
astronomy! thats the word i also get my words confused also good point about not being able to see the stars when theres a storm seemed to have forgotten that too im a mess!,1
amen god taught me so much through my struggles,0
never fear if you hear some foreign sound inside your ear ive got nothing ma to live up to!! -its alright ma im only bleedingdylan i dont worry because with earnest efforts daily you shall slowly see everything you are and everything you can be and everything you mean to me,0
depression is a misnomer for an illness of the brain where serotonin and brain cells are depleted the nervous systems lines of communication are tangled into unbearably painful knots,1
so true thats why its so hard to trust ppl in ur life because ur always afraid that they are going to tell someone ur personal business !!!!-,0
as i was moving from one low income neighborhood to another a neighbor welcomed me  if i can be of help i live here i asked could you be with me when im afraid when being i have bipolar having said that like the 1st neighborhood my whole life and family  pets turned upside down and i thought having bipolar was bad this was worse trusting help  now in my 3rd low income and well understood thank god and the people❤️ ,0
absolutely true everyone struggles with anxiety or depression and it can be a really scary time be there listen dont talk silence sometimes is all one needs not judgement,0
they always doi dont know why they feel so obligated to say something! if they dont understand our struggle they can simply say "i dont understand what youre going though i can only imaginebut know this i am here to hug you to talk to you to be there for you!" this is what i did with my cousin until now that i too have depression social anxiety panic attacks and anxiety disorder,0
i have been in this exact situation i confided in someone i thought i could trust and the very same day i heard them making fun of my situation to someone else not only was i hurt and upset it also caused me to have issues trusting people however the positive that came from that is i handed all my problems over to christ cuz i know i can fully trust him and he will guide me in the right direction and i have become a much stronger woman !!!,0
you also have great fear you will be betrayedvery hard to trust an when you do you wish you had not trusted,1
and sometimes anxiety hyphens anger so some people can still kick ass even if theyre feeling down and out lol,0
this is such a great graphic shows how many of us with mental illness struggle,0
i wrote about the haze last night  and the heart beating as if a train has just hit a wall the pain is overwhelming to the point of feeling like your in the fire not just next to it  yet noone sees this all they see is you maybe looking melancholy watch twilight when bell is changing and noone notices because they think shes dead !!! thats what its like ,0
i havent worked since november of last year we lost our home and had to move with my parents my hubby and two kiddos work is extremely stressful and anxiety provoking i have ptsd from work i applied for ssdi i am waiting my decision to see if we need to appeal,1
my anxiety is so bad i do isolate myself,1
anxiety is preventing me from work most times not many understands that not physically lazy at all i lose interest really fast,1
i went through this when i first started my job it did last about 2 years you may be different but eventually it does go away it is important that you take your medication even if you do feel well like you i hear voices if i dont take my meds the anxiety is just another aspect of your illness so you need to take your meds just to let you know ive been in my job for 18 years you can do this to without your medication you are very much on an edge and could trip over at any time the anxiety your feeling about working is because its new and unknown dont leave yourself vulnerable without your medication ,1
i hear you work is a major stressor for a lot of people with mental health issues what ive learned is stay in the moment and practice mindfulness stay focused at the task at hand if anxiety strikes go to the bathroom to remove yourself from the situation and breathe for a few minutes its hard i understand i work part time and its a problem for me too dealing with anxiety that work triggers  you must tell yourself that you know exactly what you doing you are also a valuable employee  its so difficult feeling with others in the workplace  keep to yourself stay focused and do your best and if you panic in front of others dont worry it wont be the end of the world everyone has anxiety at one time or another but its hard hang in there think of the money and the worse anxiety of being unemployed repeat to yourself this feeling will pass and move on in the moment  xxxx,0
this is no way to live your depressive disorder is a disease just like having high blood pressure and refusing to take the medicine to control it your medications do what your body is unable to do for itself,1
i didnt realize until i was installing fb on my mothers smart phone plastered across the top of her feed read "bond michele bond commented in the group bipolar/depression/anxiety" people can see what we write if they go looking but is it necessary to advertise?,1
i have bipolar type 2 and have been working since last november and i live in fear of my next drop,1
i have anxiety with the public so i got a warehouse job and have been alot better,1
im there to and i only work sat and sunday 12 hour shifts but get sick to my stomach and anxious i thought about quitting n hiding to at times,0
lucy mcgowan thank you! i have been in counseling since i was 12 it helps but not the same as having another that has been through similar situationyea my jobs used to last 6 months at the most and then id quit!!! as i have gotten older the anxiety has gotten worse i try to deal with it the best i can but sometimes it gets the best of me!!!,1
im so sorry you feel that way no one should live with constant fear and anxiety counseling helps i hope you can get the help you need,1
i dont know what the answer for you is at this point in your life but i know that meds can help a lot with anxiety the problem is we need a certain amount of anxiety to spur us onwardbut too much anxiety can make your job a whole lot harder that stress sure can wear you out it can damage your body and mind pray is what i do i used to pray before work i used to say to god "i know that nothing is going to happen today that you and i cant handle together" some people wont believe this but god tells me to trust him prayer helps us with wisdom we can ask for strength and for wisdom and power to get through the anxiety i have a bible verse for you 2 timothy 6 "wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands 7 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power and of love and of a sound mind the gift he spoke of was prayer in the power of the holy spiritit is worth asking for it is evidence that the holy spirit dwells in a believer in christ it gives power spiritually to live a christian life and to have faith ask god for all these things go to a full gospel church maybe you wont like me talking about faith but god can heal us if we trust him it can take time medication is something to pray about too if you can attend a church or ministry where people pray for one another to get free of spiritual illness once a woman prayed for me when i was really depressed and god touched me and totally lifted my depression and i had a great peace some people have the gift of praying for people and the people get healed,0
i know im on rispedidol for hallucinations the comes with the depression but im not on anything for anxiety,0
resperidol is not an anxiety drug its an antipsychotic generally used in bipolar schizophrenia etc,1
i was taking rispedol and nothing for anxiety,1
and antidepressants help with anxiety they took away my panic attacks when i was young,1
mdd-major depressive disorder and ironically depression and anxiety tend to go hand in hand,1
your anxiety is because you have put your body in danger never stop your meds please rethink this choice,1
its safe to say youre not ok and you need to take your meds anxiety wont just go away without the aid of medication,1
i absolutely understand where your coming from your definitely not alone in this one there are very few people that i actually make calls to regularly & its because they are dealing with similar issues to me so they understand me & i find them not only easy to talk to but theyre a huge support (we are supportive to each other) anyone else i speak to on the phone either call me or im calling them back they all understand this is how i am & how i need it to be i think the main reason im not good at calling people is the fact that its exhausting! having to explain how i am what ive been up to (if i can even remember) what treatments im currently having (meds etc) if its all working for me & what my doctor thinks or says? sometimes they just want to know everything & its tiring! also knowing that some of the people im speaking to dont really understand what im dealing with can be frustrating but still i have to remember that they are trying theyre making an effort they want to keep in contact because they are trying to understand & they care i have to remember that its a good thing & i do have to acknowledge respect & love them for that sometimes i do just text them a short message though its easier for me when im not feeling my best & i can control the details that i want to go into theyve learned to accept this about me & i guess any contact is better than no contact right? in the end for me theres no right or wrong way when it comes to contacting my family members & friends i need to feel comfortable & somewhat understood by the people im speaking to & they need to understand that sometimes i dont want to talk about my issues ill just quickly let them know how im doing & that now id rather talk about something else our world doesnt have to constantly revolve around our illness especially when were speaking to family just because we feel its expected sometimes its nice to have a conversation that doesnt involve my illness i really hope that ive helped you & not confused you further,0
im so sorry his is where i struggle too not the same situation per se but my heart breaks for you,0
stay strong folks and do not be afraid to get help its the label mental illness that scares people sending out caring thoughts and love to any one that needs it ,0
please please hang in there hun it sounds as though things are at an all time low things can get better im not sure where you are so am unsure what services you can access so its hard to know who might be able to help but others have suggested places to try if you are in the uk surely you can have joint access at least to your son? i hope you have good and appropriate professional support to help you could they help with some sleeping tablets to help in the short term? having no sleep can make everything so much harder just for a temporary measure? im not sure how old your son is but whatever age he needs his mum and he needs her well and happy i hope you can find the strength to beat this for him and for yourself do you have people to lean on? xx,1
call someone hopefully you were given crisis team numbers or visit a&e x you are in an acute phase & need to use your energy to dial for assistance x i was there 10 years ago with a manic phase of bipolar x the restless legs may be a depakote side effect but continue to take it until youve had proper advice x reach out xx,1
not depakote but i had to stop taking seroquel because of the restless legs/disturbed sleep i did stop the meds after consulting with my dr though always do that always consult your doctor,1
tell your doctor about the restless legs; if the depakote is causing it they can find you another med rls by itself can make you feel suicidal let alone with a pre-existing situation the affordable care act is still in place so if you dont have health insurance go to the emergency room this is an emergency,0
did you recieve medical attention? are you safe? is there someone safe that you can be with? i am so sorry to hear how much your struggling and what your going through <3 we are here for you please stay safe <3,0
you are ill  it is an illness  you can get better with support your husband should be ashamed go to the accident and emergency department at your local hospital they will be able to get the right people involved in your treatment if you need to cry then do it as it is often a good release good luck deep breaths and take it hour by hour xx,1
i have not got over my nanny and she passed in the 90s i still miss her and talk to her and hurt! my current med made me very irritated and i dont wanna be around people! dr is putting me on something new! so we will see!,0
youre still struggling with symptoms see your doctor for a med adjustment :),0
this may be the family that i have so desperately needed for over 40 years,1
i didnt get any sleep just lost big chunks of time id been afraid of it because my ex always told me it made her have "demonic" dreams i had no such problem just no sleep,0
yes i currently take ambien for the same reason as u i try to avoid taking it my husband woke me up in the morning 4 hours after i had taken it i do not recall any of our conversation he told me that i seemed incoherent and "drugged out",1
worked good for me for years with no bothersome side effects then just quit workig im terminally ill they prescribed me a benzono fear of tolerance or addiction when your dying but definitely concerns for long term use good luck insomnia bites,1
they prescribed me that and prozac two weeks ago to take together and i just didnt trust it im not a pill popper im so scared of pills hell my prozac pills made things worse for me and suicidal!/: the best advice i can try and give you is maybe tylenol that puts me to sleep for some awkward reason or try doing meditation or yoga before bed i wish you much luck,0
i was on ambien for months and i was like a zombie i was tired all day i just pass out i passed out twice while driving and wrecked once its horrible id be talking on the phone and boom id be asleep in a split second mid sentence it was a nightmare i take trazadone now works pretty good for me,0
ambien is a scary drug i was on it for quite a while and the the same experiences as many others doing things i didnt remember the next day i now take temazapam it works fairly well but im groggy for about half the next day i only take it if i havent slept for a few days there is no easy answer to the sleep issue,1
i didnt like i only took at night around 7or 8 and id still feel the affects the next day tell around 2 in the afternoon i had the weirdest dreams on it also bad hot sweats felt like a zombie all day long then they gave me something to take for mood stabilizer like wtf smhbeen on ever med for deppession & ocd& anxiety there nothing i havent been on  i used to get kidney stones often also my gallbladder & liver dont function right i had the worse stomach pain every ive been using medical marijuana now for about 8 yrs and juicing fresh fruits & veggies and my life has been given back to me my body & mind feel healed and yes i still have depression but its under control and now im in control and never felt more better in my life herbalism really worked for me,0
i discovered remnants of food wrappers/containers next to my bed and that was my cue that i was going downstairs to the kitchen & eating while asleep on ambien i was nervous of going down the stairs when i was consciously awake so this really scared me! so i stopped using it for fear i might be one that would drive & not be aware! (i did feel rested after i awoke though!) tried taking belsomra and although i didnt have same side-effect it wired me up so bad my eyes wouldnt even stay closed! now i am back to taking xanax (05mg) when i cannot sleep,1
i will not let anyone put me on ambien my mom was on ambien and she was a zombie! she would hallucinate things and would do things and have no memory of doing it! and she was completely addicted to it after watching her horror i am scared of that stuff!!,0
ive taken for yrs yes if you take it and watch tv or read etc then you end up walking snacking cleaning etc but in my case i had but know what im doing at the time do found ive done nothing out of my character just more obsessed with eating or cleaning! next morning i may have forgotten in morning but do remember with prodding you must go to bed take it close your eyes and go to sleep nothing else my husband swears it wont work unless he takes it 1/2 hour before uuuuggg! ive had to tell him "!go to bed!" hes ate a whole bag of popcycles in bed! or try and hold a conversation with others so as it works for some with no side effects not so hot for others were all different chemically it will effect differently unfortunately i have als i need it to sleep and it works but take it and immediately go to sleep if you have trouble stop!,1
ive been taking ambien for a long time now so i guess i have worked through a lot of the odd things yes you will forget things you did sometimes the stuff you did shortly before you took it too it gives me the munchies too its almost amusing when you find out what you ate last night sucks when it hits hard and you have a glass of milk in your hand i never seem to forget that feeling ever i dont sleep i dont get tired i was wide awake at 2am last night still and am back up at 7am im not currently manic either this is me but without help with sleep i wont sleep at all and the mania comes on to scary levels,1
ambien saved my life i was sleeping maybe an hour a night and my health and mental health deteriorated drastically yes i finally went to sleep and i slept for 24 hours straight but once id been taking it for about a month it regulated and i wasnt sleeping all the time or tired anymore but these other ladies are right "sleep" walking driving eating and sex really does happen on it for me it was worth it i dont take it anymore and you can become dependant on it and thats not pretty for about a week after stopping i had severe panic attacks when i stopped taking it,1
i took ambien and would wake up and do things i couldnt remember the next day it was really scary honestly i would take something different,1
ambien is the devil did stuff without remembering horrible i will never take it again eventually i had to have my then 9 year old start hiding my keys at night,0
when i was on it i felt the same way like a constant state of zombieness i ended up getting off of it because it made my anxiety bad but i took half of what he prescribed me it still helped me fall asleep but i didnt feel like the walking dead the next day,0
to help counter this problem my dr prescribed memory medication that is often used for mild alheimers (cant spell that) and dementia his reasoning is that some of my other meds like mood stabilizer and anxiety meds may also be part of the memory problem,1
meds can take normal emotions away it is normal to have some moods this is what i believe we are all sinners and god sent jesus to save us from our sins if we walk with god he walks with us and he challenges us to become like him but he miraculously rescues us out of our sins by daily filling us with himself in the person of the holy spirit when we repent of sin god hears us and helps us a christian live is all about relationship to god through christ a daily life of prayer and viewing our personal life through the what the bible says we can change some meds make us less caring and compassionate they can take our motivation away our mental illnesses can make us irritable and uncaring too what i am doing these days is praying to see people through gods eyes i know that god sees us all through eyes of love and understanding he is for us sometimes we just have to do the right things and trust god to give us the strength and the love to go with it god knows the motivations of the heart give thanks for what you do right feel good about every victory in becoming the person you want to become our hearts long for god and our hearts long for true caring relationships it takes effort these days to be a good neighbor we all live more isolated lives than people did one hundred years ago it takes effort to be outgoing and giving you cant do it all but we each can be giving in some way some people have all they can handle trying to be good to their family,0
i have bipolar border line personality disorder and n other conditions anxiety depression insomnia etc i smoke weed daily it really helps me stay calm n my mind dosent wander as much best medicine im on,1
im the same way but also as well as dealing with bpd depression anxiety and suicidal ideation just life we deal with what we get,1
bipolar antisocial caused by anxiety hyper emotional manic depression manipulative loving my children dont care for others have a hard time showing emotion no meds weed used to help in the beginning now it really just calms the anxiety panic attacks and the hyper emotional,1
as long as it works for youwhos anybody to say differently?weed works for my bipolar bf!not so much for methoughi meanit does calm me downyesbut does it take my depression away??not alwaysdoes it take my anxiety away?sometimesbut sometimes it actually makes it worseso im forced to still take my geodontrilleptalzoloftklonopin and ambieneverydaytil i die,1
i manipulate have all my life bipolar and anxiety i was only girl in my family among 6 grandkids the youngest spoiled i have to gave my way i do feel love i over love part of ocd,0
that drug saved me i have bipolar depression anxiety and sleep problems and taking zyprexa ive been able to fall asleep within an hour of taking it an actually sleep through the night and wake up rested i didnt get mood swings and my depression was better highly recommend,1
it was literally a life saver for me i had gone 2 years with only 8 hours of sleep per month my body was shutting down it did make me sleep zyprexa is an anti-psychotic med they have had to put me on it a couple of times when manic or experiencing psychosis if you feel like a zombie the dose is too high i wont even mention how much weight i gained there was no other options for me id say i have a love hate relationship with zyprexa when they took me off of it i still had some pills left this is probably bad advice but when life becomes too overwhelming if i dont have to be anywhere the next day i will take about half a pill for one night im a zombie the next day but its like it resets me no dr ever recommended doing this & im pretty sure my dr would tell me not to do it yet its kept me from killing myself more times than i can count,0
i gained about 50 lbs with the zyprexa melt away it did help a little but the restless legs constipation and headachesalong with the weight gain made it not worth it to me its weight i cant get off too,1
those people that do that are more insecure than the person they are joking about  its a defense mechanism,0
everyday people will use my insecurities to their advantage,1
such a life sit try figure if take right amount of sleeping pills to sleep to feel better or take all the sleeping pills and never worry about feeling ever again,1
my boyfriend doesnt understand how hard it is to have a mental condition he says "its all in your head" yes it is all in my head but not like that he dont get how it hurts everything inside me the stress of going to the store when im feeling off how sometimes my body dont feel like its mine which is so weird to be disconnected from yourself he will never understand it because 1 he dont have it 2 hes an ass,0
so true people need to know more about this problemand stop to think that we are all humanand we have feelingsjust at times alot stronger and confusing ,0
i suffer with post traumatic stress disorder and on a lot of medication but i have get on the best i can dont ask for sympathy and i dont give it,1
i know im not theone that wrote that but some of what was stated is exactly what im going thru ive been on meds since the end of jan- first part of feb of this year i went to jail for discipling my child and since then ive been without a job which is stressful living with my mom who gives into my sons every whimper i know i cant give up because of my son but what do you do when you have no one in the home that is willing to talk to you? when you are so angry that you blame god for putting you thru all of this stress? i have suicidal thoughts several times a day especially when my son pushes my buttons and then when i yell he tells me he wants me to die it is very hard but trust me going to a place once a week at a church will help ive started going to a group that is mainly for addicts art a church and ive been getting more and more into reading the bible and trying not to yell as much when he pushes my buttons whoever this anonymous person is if you would like to reach out for someone to talk to please feel free to send me a private message,0
you know that you have to go to a therapist and tell the therapist all this but you also know that god cares seek him again every day know that he is there for you have confidence in him eat a good diet and have some things in your life that make you happy forget about what people might think of you it absolutely does not matter what matters is that god loves you so completely and totally he never leaves you and you are going to get through this this is a tough time of your life you need to take care of yourself you have to have some friends you can go to a support group with nami or a peer support group you can invite someone over for coffee and chose to ignore your fearful feelings you can go for a walk someplace pretty you can read the bible and you can tell yourself positive truths you can put on some uplifting music and do some art work or crochet or knit you have to have things to look forward to! i am really getting into growing things i have stuff on my apartment patio i spent money on good organic potting soil if i did not have a patio i would get really cheap succulent plants and propagate them you can take parts of one plant and get a lot of other plants to grow it gives you something to look forward to i have some cats and kitties cuddling is really nice when you are single as far as the family accepting you make it clear that you are glad you are part of their family call them up and ask how they are try to call at good times for them it is worth the effort my oldest sister always acted like i was bothering her when i called because she was always busy and irritable and sick i knew she wasnt feeling well i think if you call family that you want to know better you will get to know them better ask some of them over for cake and coffee lunch or dinner god to church and meet some nice people dont feel self conscious meeting people you dont have to like all the people and they dont all have to like you but you will make some friends if you continue to go if one church does not work out try another and another the library has ways to meet other moms also kids sport events we can have horrible pasts and god can heal us and make us strong i know that this is true because i am 61 and i lived through a lot of horrible times like you did try to be there for your kids the way you wished someone had been there for you as a kid do stuff with your kids and dont let yourself pull away from them they need you play games with them go out with them it raises your spirits but moderation in all things you need to rest get a good physical too as sometimes it is physical illness that zaps our energy and makes us depressed have faith that things will get better do what you can to make them better keep in touch with the son who stays with family dont let that break your heart maintain contact and let him know you love him and you are there for him on a regular basis,0
read the last thing you wrote? your kids you had a really tough life and i see where that has had a huge impact  i had a shitty childhood too such traumas can cause us go through life with negative self talk and fear mindfulness is very helpful,0
how is it possible you dont see how amazing it is you lived thru everything you dealt with growing up? your story is amazing and im sure could help someone else struggling have you ever thought about using your experiences to help others ? it might help heal you in the process of giving you some self-worth there are lots of support groups you could join youve made it so far dont give up!! god is preparing you for greatness keep praying but get involved with some support groups to help you continue to heal,1
yes it is horrible get off this post philtazsimmons taz or keep your mouth shut,0
wtf? thats horrible to say,0
im sorry to hear you feel this way you know its the illness making you feel this way there is a bit of sensibility and logic in what youve written so somewhere in the background you very much want to fight this i want to ask do you take any medication for your condition? do you ever see a doctor please dont think that people are waiting for you to die theyre not this is very much the illness and you have to be strong against it with the right medication you can have a normal life just as an example i have had mental health problems all my life and ive been on lithium duloxitane and amisulpride these drugs of help me maintain a normal life and ive been in my job for 18 years i was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar 27 years ago please do not give up hope please push the paranoid thoughts away and if youre not on meds try and see a doctor your worth it you are in my thoughts ,0
you are loved! if no one else is going to say it i will i love you i love you for reaching out i love you for sharing i love you for saying something before you did something irreversible the best metaphor ive ever heard was about a man having a conversation with god he didnt want to go on he was tired he just wanted to find resthe couldnt make it another dayhe couldnt even make it until that nightand god asked "can you make it to the kitchen? eat breakfast then we will see how you feel" dont think of handling the pain in days or even hourscan you make it a few more minuets? yes you caneven if its the most grueling and vulnerable momentsyou made it through this post you can make it through the commentsjust one more commentone more person telling you how loved you are you are loved you are important you are needed please stay,0
these feelings are symptoms not truth and god is the one person who never has any bad feelings about you ever his approval of you doesnt have conditions thats the kind of love you probly never experienced either i dont know if you have a counselor but they do help they are the steady person when we are in chaos and they understand the struggle more than most people,0
dont give in to those who want you to fail and end your life mbr you have to protect your children no matter how much you truly hurt inside dont leave ur kids vulnerable to the sickos of the worldwere here for you! i cannot be there to give you a hug try and find a support group by you ( if any ),0
try to see if medication change helps ask ur doctor or if not helpful see another doctor check the side effects of ur meds when u feel up to it things will get better even if it doesnt seem like it dont worry try doing things u enjoy / little more each day/ stay away from stress/ stressful ppl/ try sumthing new if u feel ok with it take it slow and dont forget it will get better pray to god if u want bout what u want we all here for help and advice x,1
thats what im afraid of,0
i tried therapy and my anxiety and depression spiraled out of control and told my psychiatrist and she didnt offer a way to deal with it and i was in & out of the er from having panic attacks even after taking the meds and the er & my pcp told me my meds needed to be increased and she didnt want to hear that either so what do i do,1
if you dont believe those average joes sitting across from you will honestly help dont go i tried going to a therapist for depression/ anxiety and it didnt last 2 visits she tried to prescribe me pills and baby talked that everything will be fine i was 38 not a child and she annoyed me worse than my anxiety did yeah i dont believe a stranger listening is a miracle fix,1
many of you seem to be struggling but be advised its a character test some pass some fallout but its very difficult to go it alone stick together united and your odds increase tenfold,0
hi there sounds as though things have been dreadful for you of late i guess to try to answer some of those questions; id need to ask some of my own im wondering first if you now live on your own? do you have people around to support you? do you still have close family around and you talked about your mum originally? do you have any professional support? are you taking any medication? sorry for the questions but i dont want to suggest anything which might offend or hurt it probably wont help to read this but most of the feelings you describe sound very familiar and common with mental health problems these extreme feelings which of course are worrying and real im wondering if you have left home and gone away to study? has your support network gone? if you are at college or university (forgive me for the terminology as im thinking you could be in the us and im in the uk) is there any support at your place of study? we can be so unkind to ourselves when we are suffering we can blame ourselves when it is all beyond our control are there any wellbeing courses or workshops you can access? the road to recovery involves several things which when you are in the midst of the turmoil can appear to be too much of a mountain to climb but it is possible and usually involves small but significant achievable steps but we need to lean on people and we need people who can support us reaching out to people on these sites is a really good first step explaining how you feel xx,0
sandra bowman benzos r indicated for the treatment of anxiety and no they wont kill u,1
im skeptical that ur psychiatric provider will prescribe benzos for u if u have a history of abusing substances let me share my situation i also suffer from severe anxiety i have taken xanax (alprazolam) in the past for a total of 5 years i started seeing a new psychiatrist last year he treats patients with substance abuse disorders as a result he refuses to prescribe any benzos for me however they throw an ambien prescription (10 mg) at me i may consider changing physicians,1
i need to go to beacon and pick up my results! i did one too didnt like the psych or the people in the office so i found another and never looked back im struggling with meds now so im going to need to get those!,0
tell them your concerns i had issues with opiates in the past and i told them what i was worried about and what i was hoping to accomplish with meds great way to start looking for the right meds combo,1
alit of psychiatrists are trying to ween ppl off the benzos one reason is bc they have a street value but the biggest reason is bc of the addiction i have been on klonopins for 9 yrs now and its getting to where they arent working like they use to bc my body is use to them but even the with the problems i have my doc refuses to increase bc they have a street value but after a whole year trying to find something for my panic/anxiety disorder and ptsd that has been the only thing that helps and was the last medication i tried even after refusing the xanax i had no idea what klonopin was back then what the doctor tries you out on is what u need to try before the benzos bc benzos can do permanent damage when coming off of them just be honest about whats going on with you and discuss the medication they are offering,1
i have anxiety depression bipolar agoraphobia and panic attacks i am on zoloft for my anxiety and depression which works good but keeps me awake at night i take trileptal for bipolar and it works good and helps me sleep i take ativan for panic attacks and i only use it as needed because it makes u feel like a zombie,1
work with your doctors it has taking me years to find the right ones have someone you trust help you at your home life know what you are on and help you find the right you you want the wrong douse can mess you up and others can help you what works for others may not work for you you will still feel depression and anxiety and that is normal just dont let it completely control you that is why we all take our meds good luck you are not alone in this battle ;,1
make sure to ask about side effects a lot of medications for mental illness cause weight gain some even cause depression and anxiety manic episodes and suicidal thoughts so no these dont happen to everyone but its good to know what may possibly happen a really bad one for weight gain is seroquel although it does help with sleep and moods apparently for many and something that i have come across and it was something really horrible called akathesia and i hope im explaining this correctly not even sure i spelled it correctly but it is a nerve disorder really the only way i can explain it is that it looks like youre having a seizure your arms and legs move involuntarily its a horrible horrible side effect of latuda which made me sad because latuda really worked well for my bipolar depression but like i said not everyone gets the side effects,1
i take gabapinten for anxiety (works so much better than klonopin for me) and i take a tricyclic for depression (some uncomfortable side effects) but i cant tolerate any other type of depression meds,1
prudence lowe benjamin my doctor had me on all kinds of medicine at one time but ive never heard of the benzos what is that for anxiety or for depression and why do you say it will kill you what is the side effects to it,0
clonazepam for panic attacks effexor/venlafaxine for anxiety mirtazapine for insomnia,1
i have found ssris better for depression and anxiety snris tend to be good for depression but exacerbate anxiety and tend to be more addictive well thats my experience anyway ❤️ best of luck hope you feel better soon x,1
leave the meds to the psych just tell all of your concerns of your illness anyone who walks in and starts asking for certain meds sends an alarm off in the mind of your doctor that is what is called drug seeking behavior the doctor is then more likely to reduce your meds no matter how much you may need them once that type of behavior is marked down in your chartwell you see the problem,1
i second beth- i would not go to the appointment asking for specific meds- i would talk to them about the symptoms you are experiencing and how they are affecting your life and ability to work and get along with family benzos are a big deal- they are incredibly addictive- yes you feel better taking them but you will need more and more to get the same effect and that leads to addiction- please if the doctor declines to prescribe them do not feel they do not care about you- they are expressing care not prescribing them i love the effect of klonopin but have decided they are just too dangerous for me to be taking as i abuse them- i do not wish to take an overdose due to not being able to keep track of my dosage i am on a non addictive medicine called buspar for anxiety so there are other options besides benzos,0
be careful asking for advice on meds to take here everyone is different and what works for 1 wont necessarily work for you its a trial and error thing and something you must work closely with your dr on it took me 18 mths to get the right combo i can say one thing drs are reluctant to pres robe benzodiazepines because they lose their effect if used long term so you need more and more and they are addictive great for short term use but thats about it talk to your dr about cognitive behavioural therapy it has been great for me as it has given me tools to help myself i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder,1
me too im on medication and in therapy to help manage my anxiety and major depression,1
sometimes depression causes anxiety so maybe starting on an antidepressant would be best just tell them all your symptoms your feelings your questions and your concerns tell them what your treatment goals are too,1
ive looked into both tms & ect ive been told that tms helps more with anxiety & depression but not other illnesses like bipolar,1
you cut because you are nervous and it relieves anxiety if you figure out what times you do it and what is going through your head when you do it that will help it gives you some kind of satisfaction if you can find something else to do with your mind and your body at that time that is positive it might help can you draw crochet or knit when you are feeling anxious like this if these things make you more nervous dont do them so long,1
try not to think about it that way bro think about the positives i personally deal with the same kind of stuff i scare myself thoughts of suicide every single minute of everyday but i just try as much as i can to distract myself and if i cant then i will admit i take it out on myself ( self harm ) but its better than the alternative im here for you if you ever wanna just chat,0
it sounds so dreadfully hard for you at this time it also sounds as though you ve been going through this turmoil for such a long time i wish i had all the answers im wondering how long you have been seeing your therapist and if you feel seeing them is helping you also state you are taking medication but still feel as bad as this have you been taking them for a long time and does your therapist feel they are the right tablets and the right dose as you are still struggling so much? the only thing with trying to help and to feed back is the need to ask further questions only just to try to think of things which might help you talk about the feelings you have to your wife im wondering how long you have been together how supportive she is and i guess deep down how you feel about your relationship? can you remember the feelings you had when you first got together what attracted you can you recall some of those happy memories? thats a difficult one only you can really come to the conclusion how you really feel do you have any meaningful activities in your life? you didnt say whether you are able to work? with regards to considering why you cut yourself its hard to say as luckily i have never done that not that i didnt consider doing something and its probably hard to remember the exact thoughts before and while you were doing it i remember the thoughts when i considered it people have suggested probably already the main reasons people do it such as actually wanting to feel something as depression often makes you literally feel numb while at the same time your head can be in such a turmoil im wondering too if it can be the culmination of pent up anger resentment and frustration when you cant escape the desperate situation you are in when there seems nothing you can do to escape other than if you are lucky; sleep sometimes could this be a way of interrupting the cycle of over thinking and feeling dreadful? often i knew i wanted to escape i wasnt living merely existing whilst battling depression and anxiety day after day the desire to be somewhere else was immense but it always seemed so illusive when we crave contentment and peace the happy lives so many seem to have then occasionally death might seep into our thoughts as a better alternative to the sh*t we are always feeling i knew luckily that wasnt the answer and also i didnt want to not be here i just didnt want to be there i guess what im trying to say is we so desperately want all this pain to end and sometimes ending it all seems to only solution of course its not there is a better way recovery and a better life is the way the key but to reach that can seem such a monumental task to get there unfortunately can take a long time but it is possible and real but you do need people to help its necessary to lean on people and to let them help recovery relies on many things some very small but all important are there any other agencies you can access? charities? peer support? exercise is really good but small achievable and significant steps are key goals are helpful not huge goals small ones little steps exercise can literally begin with just sitting in the sun feeling the sun on your face trying once again to feel the sensations of the weather around you building up to perhaps a short walk and building up from there of course i dont want to patronise and teach you to suck eggs as they say over here but just trying to remember the things which helped me on the road to better mental health going back to the self harm im wondering sometimes it might also be wanting to actually feel something the illness and the drugs can leave you feeling nothing and inflicting pain on yourself will make you feel it might also divert your thoughts from the pain you feel inside your head to the actual physical pain? it is so hard to put into words what i thought when i considered it i felt as though i wanted to punish myself in some way that was payback for not being able to beat this hideous illness i think i felt a failure and weak in some way that the depression was winning and i wasnt strong enough to control it it was controlling me and why wasnt i able to fight this off and get better? also i hated being so self centred with depression i felt i spent all my days going over and over the past reliving awful things that had happened and just wallowing in self pity i hated it thats not me im not selfish but i couldnt stop it was self hard a way of hurting myself? did i deserve to be punished? of course i didnt but i couldnt see it at the time we can be so hard on ourselves mental illness is so hard when we have such conflicting emotions and having the strength to recover just alludes us when we need it most so sorry to run on so just trying to really think if there is anything which you might be able to relate to a healthy diet and trying to introduce things to give your life meaning are very important i know it can be hard when sometimes its not even possible to get out of bed but you have done so well in admitting things and getting help the desire to get better is the key there is a better way recovery and inner peace is possible but it takes time we must try so hard for ourselves we owe it to ourselves to beat this and to our loved ones best wishes always here x,0
im a recovering self harmer one of the things that helped me was when i wanted to cut i would squeeze ice cubes this sounds stupid but wait! squeezing releases that stress and there is a bit of pain that comes from the coldness of the ice it has been a long hard road this did not always work but sometimes it did i hope this helps someone,0
i am sorry youre going through that i myself am going through the same thing i have been off and on medications for years now ive also been placed in hospital our story is pretty similar sometimes we dont realize what we do because we have panic attacks we feel a loss of hope that no one cares and you feel like you want to give up on life thats how i felt and sometimes i feel that way often still so i hope you get treatment and hope everything goes well with you,0
i know it costs money any goes against many beliefs but getting tattoos is better than cutting my bf is 100% against tattoos so i havent gotten one yet and its embarrassing my scars from the pasti used to cut as it would drown out the pain iiwas feeling at the time,0
some meds may help but some may cause anhedonia good luck ,1
my goodness i understand and find myself in a dark place i have to say that i am worried for youi believe that you need to go to your nearest emergency department dont think about it just pack a toothbrush and go you are loved you are needed your are more than enough tell yourself remember that we are all here,0
dont say that you have come so far which just goes to show you how very strong you are when you suffer with a mental illness eachday hour minute can be a struggle do you have support? does your wife understand? the best support system is the ones closest to you but they need to understand the illness and that is is consuming at times and thats okay they love the entire you bad and good please stay strong fight and keep pushing through,0
their music helped me through so many hard times before i found out about my depression and even more so now that ive been diagnosed with anxiety and bipolar disorder,1
i was told years ago that i was too sensitive; they have no idea that she permanently did damage to a fragile mind it ultimately helped induce the paranoia /ptsd i now have to fight against everyday no i havent forgotten  ill never forget all of it,0
i didnt get the rash but i got the itching and the itching was horrible! my stupid doctor told me to keep taking it i fired him and got a new doctor,1
dont hesitate to contact dr,0
the lamictal rash can progress to stevens-johnson syndrome which is life-threatening so you did the right thing stopping the med but you still should have seen a doctor at the onset of the rash notify your prescriber asap and get to the first md you can see - urgent care or er or whatever blistering/peeling skin can be a sign of sjs did you/do you have flu-like symptoms too?,1
youre supposed to start on the lowest dose and slowly start to go up to avoid the rain it is a symptom that makes you basically allergic to your own skin your doctor should have informed you of this and told you to send him a picture of the rain immediately when it appeared to determine if it was from the medication you did the right thing to stop it if you stopped it soon enough it should subside,1
go to your dr as soon as possible and let them know about it not trying to scare you but the rash can cause death,0
the world has turned its back on me im only guilty of merely existing,0
if your anxiety is the innate generalized anxiety disorder (free-floating anxiety) type you can blame gene slc6a4 which codes for anxiety related disorder,1
find a plan that works for youbaby steps can be milestones walk a bit further ever day go somewhere every day it can be a vicious circlewe get panicked and then more frightened to go the next time believe in yourself hoping you have a therapist to help you friends/family who help and support you and big arms to give yourself a hug,0
do you only take anxiety medication!!! you might need more medication depending on symptons!,1
i was so screwed up!!! now i am on a mood stabilizer anxiety med n depression med! i still have days that are not good but usually not more than a day or so ive learned my triggers n some coping things! plus i have had a phsycologist the whole time which has helped me so much!!!!! i wish you all the luck in the world becca!!! love n hugs to you becca!!!!! ❤❤,0
yes i take anxiety/depression its a low dose though i am going to be talking with my doctor to see what i can do because i cant live the anxiety life im better then that i wish it would go away,1
anxiety absolutely sucks and when it takes over you can feel helpless i have depression/anxiety and bpd i personally found medication to not help but its about what works for you i like to take a bath to calm myself or try turn my anxiety into something useful by keeping busy be it cleaning getting out and taking the dog for a walk or playing with my daughter i have a few close friends who know and it helps to have their support and understanding try focus on the positives and remember that as hard as it may seem you can overcome it you will always have your bad days your human be easy on yourself its all a process,1
my anxiety daily its getting worse i feel the mh team are a load of crap they are no help at all,1
i can relate i wait til the last minute to go to the places i have a handful of places im comfortable with but i do relate to what youve said people look at me when i start getting nervous those who knows me they know what to do many think she doesnt look sick i do know hon,0
thank you tell him to keep going dont let the anxiety get the best of him,0
becca thomas go you for graduating from college and that goes to show how very strong you are mine is struggling to get through high school learn your limits and dont put yourself in a situation that will cause anxiety if you go out drive so you can leave when you wanti have learned through the years watching my son struggle that there are good days bad days and so so day my heart goes out to you i see how anxiety can get the best of you,0
i have bad anxiety too was in buspar for it but it didnt help nothing seems to help ,1
i know it sucks i have general anxiety disorder what gets me when people dont understand my anxiety when ive been asked to go to places i cant go to places on my own i was asked to go a barge trip down the canal afraid falling the water i cant go a bargei have severe depression two,0
i feel you on going places alone i cant go to big stores alone because my anxiety runs me out i get nervous,0
stay strong and baby steps my anxiety sometimes makes it hard for me to do things too my friends are very protective of me and know about my struggles they always are willing to just be my safe person and when introducing me to new people help me to not shut down,0
you sound like i do when my anxiety gets me i also suffer from depression so its a double douse of crap i had cat back in 2014 because of it and im currently having some sessions now after the first full programme i felt normal i no longer felt trapped or numb as i was able to speak about what was actually going on in my head instead of tiptoeing around it in fear that people would think im crazy but point is about 2 yrs later i found the courage to go travelling around aus on my own for a year ive only gone back to counselling as i recently lost my grandad and i have taken it quite hard but im currently in madrid where i flew by myself i really dont mean this as bragging just as away of showing that it can be done ,0
as you probably know by now you are not alone reading this made my chest cave a bit and a hotness run through my body what you just described was me all week last week they can teach us how to control our breathing all day but they have yet to teach me how to stop the uncomfortable heart beats the numbness in my hands the sickness in my stomach and the tears that just want to roll down if ever you need someone to talk to in the midst of these small (or large) episodes i am here to hear you out do small things for yourself hun even a small dry erase note to yourself on the mirror can give you hope to push through the day i have a huge collection of notebooks that i never use but just thinking of what i can put in them makes me happy i painted a ceramic cupcake with my daughter in the midst of my small attack (she has no idea what i go through ive made it a point to myself i would never let her see my struggle) and that alone helped me relax a bit tiny things babe we will all push through this together,0
im the same way it sucks n the anxiety bout dying sucks!!,0
im the same way i am scared to go anywhere with my fiance because i never feel right,0
i know me too sometimes i will wake up out of a dead sleep n have a panic attack it sucks my heart will be beating out my chest its scary n i stay at home all the time because of my anxiety! i just want my life bk!! ,0
yes im the one who wrote this i get feelings about dying it scares me ,0
hi there i just wanted to let you know that it really is possible for you to get past some of these things ive had anxiety (& depression) since i was 17 & im 45 now from there to here has been hell a lot but there have been and continues to be good times too im not saying its easy to make it through tough times and right now it sounds like a really really horrible time for you and im so sorry that you are going through this may i ask do you have a psychologist and psychiatrist and are you on any meds? (i have to say that when i was your age and younger i hated taking medications and i pretty much refuse to which led to a lot of horrible circumstances) next thing that i would like to ask you is if you have any support common like family members or friends? (personally i have given up telling family members about my diagnosis because they just dont understand and or they just dont care) but i am hoping you have somebody that you can confide in i have to apologize for this incredibly long message i wanted to tell you just one more thing when you talk about getting out of your house and going to stores or going out with friends or you dont to have fun i used to have one friend who would slowly take me into the stores like we would go to the parking lot and just sit there and we did that a couple of times until i felt okay and the panic attacks subsided and then we would start walking toward the door lets just say anxiety overload but we did that several times until again i was feeling okay about it and then we walked into the door and pretty much stood right inside the door once again several several times and then the next step was to walk around the store there is a name for this but i dont remember what it is i cant think of the name of this technique i know that not everything works for everybody but maybe you have someone who could do that for and with you? if you do try it like i said before im sorry that youre going through this but if you allow yourself to just have a calming of some sort and i dont like to make promises but i i really do want to say to you then i promise this will pass but you need all the help you can get talk to me anytime privately if youd like dont think that i am always so strong the majority of my days are hard as hell and sometimes okay put a smile on your face most times we need help and sometimes that help isnt right next to us sometimes it is via the internet :-) oh! another thing i wanted to say was be good to yourself we who have mental illnesses tend to do and be everything for everyone else and we forget about ourselves pamper yourself take a bubble bath or get your nails done read a good book or watch a movie anyway again i am so sorry for the long ass message and if you see errors in my message it is because i voice text (i have hand tremors from one of my medications) and a lot of times my cell phones wants to say things in another language or just say really weird words and whatnot i hope youre feeling a slight bit better okay:-) i will leave you alone for now :-),0
your very welcome :) we all know its a struggle im here for everyone :) god bless you all,0
im on anxiety/depression medicine,1
i havent slept in three days i feel terrible sometimes i cannot feel anything i get numb without emotions other times i am sad and irritable my partner doesnt seem to understand or i dont know what i can say because we no longer communicate like we used to i feel like when i open up he feels tired of it or he feels helpless i dont know but im not feeling normal most of the time its exhausting ,0
believe me i know what you mean my parents know i have anxiety & i do stress out over bills but they dont no what i go through they tell me to not stress & that im okay i normally have my fiance who talks to me who lets me no he is there to support me & that everything is going to be okay  i mean i really dont no what else to do people dont understand,0
its mostly difficult when theres no support people will just tell you to stop stressing and pray but when you cant control how you feel how do you get through the day? its really misunderstood,0
i waited until i was almost 29 to finally try anxiety medication - i really wish i had tried sooner!!! you might want to consider it especially in combination with therapy thats what has helped me so immensely,1
bipolar / depression/ anxiety open page ?? i believe we are all here to support one another as well as get professional advice ,1
kenneth seronick yes i talk to my doctor im working on getting some help me with it because its hard for me to control a lot of times i just feel alone & stay to myself i take medicine for my anxiety & depression but low dose,1
if you look at the heading it says bipolar depression and anxiety chat group so you cannot be critical of the comments she is making its an all encompassing mental health post,1
the head of page starts with bi polar it doesnt really matter anyway people that struggle with any mental issues find good help and encouragement bi polar is associated with many mental issues,0
brenda anxiety is real and you are an insensitive fool,1
cassondra pettit i wouldnt just write my story about anxiety if i didnt mean it i have suffered anxiety & depression along time  sometimes i think people dont understand how it can make the person feel  i posted on here to let people know about my anxiety and depression because its sometimes hard to find anyone who understands me and how anxiety takes over me sometimes i cant control it at all  i pray a lot that one day ill over become the anxiety its not a easy thing to deal with in life ,0
aww i think thats really not nice to say this person is obviously struggling and looking for some help bashing them down due to being a certain site is not very nice and wont help this person in any way what so ever even if it is just a bipolar site anxiety still come with bipolar and would think that anyone who has suffered this would understand this persons emotional state people going through this should support each other not bash them down it dont hurt to show a little sympathy and support knowing how it feels xxx,0
i just wanted to get my story out there i feel alone at times i got anxiety & depression i do take medicine for them but it doesnt always help ,0
if you have a close friend or family member you trust go and talk to them working keeping busy helps me some when i start thinking too much about the negative going for a walk painting praying do something that will make you happy sometimes im afraid to go places to and end up driving around because i dont want to be inside a building sometimes ill force myself to step out because i can take medication and go to counseling but the only person that going to help me is myself and god keep pushing through it spreading love to you ,0
yes i agree that it is about support for everyone involved i too have multiple diagnoses: depression anxiety bipolar and borderline personality disorder i am in multiple support groups 4 mental illnesses and a lot of times i see people who post dont have much support from the people they know personally such as myself and this way its like a third person and if we dont judge each other we are able to give ideas to help one another i can see how having things group together can be somewhat confusing but it works for a lot of people,1
terri di mauro to the best of my professional knowledge an rn with 20 years of clinical experience i do not dispute your opinion however i believe that anxiety is included as a diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder i believe that alot of members of these support communities tend to fixate on their multiple diagnosesi have bipolar gad ptsd borderline personality disorder etc mania and depression must coexist in order for the bipolar diagnostic criteria to be satisfied i dont mean to come across but i just wanted to convey the downside of grouping multiple diagnoses together may cause some confusion among its members especially since it is an open group in contrast the bipolar support group is closed,1
some manifestations of bipolar mania include high anxiety so the 3 can be very closely related; its also often the case that those diagnosed with bipolar end up with a dual diagnosis including anxiety and/or depression,1
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page,1
i understand how you are feeling! i think when you are on this path you have to try to find the good in every day even the smallest of things like a good cup of coffee some quiet reading time the birds singing some good calm music its easier said than done i know! but for me i had to get to a point where i had to take control i had to find someone to talk to and explain my feelings try to pin point what is triggering your anxiety is it social media is it the news is it the outside noise? i know its not easy im in a hard place as well right now but we have to try to keep moving forward surround ourselves with the things that make us happy or put our souls at ease,0
it is even more difficult when you have physical illnesses and you get even more depressed it truly becomes an ugly vicious circle of pain all over i suffer get tired of the fight but i refuse to let my illnesses have the last word i will not allow my pain to win!!! we are all praying and waiting for cures i know how hard it is when you only get an hour or 2 sleep in a week i wish you all the best in your struggles love and prayers! warrior on!,0
tired im struggling now to get it all back under control cant find meds that even help about to give up,0
deppression should be taken serious! its scary! i know i have it with bi-polar people may look at like your happy but inside your cofused you see deathbut you keep smiling its sad i know then there are the ones deppressed who shout out for help and everyone thinks they are wanting attention no! no! they are actually shaking people and saying "yea i do want attention im trying to get you to lift them upso they wont take that drastic decisiondeath cuz everyone dont believe you anymoreif you dont change things open your heart and listen i might years down the road mean they not i,0
hi it sounds as though you have been through so much it isnt surprising that you are struggling having cancer and having to undergo chemo must have been gruelling enough on its own i know it can be terrible it sounds as though you have done so well coming out the other side so to speak in a sense should be easier but it might be a time when you start to relax ie it might not feel such a fight but also your goal has been achieved to get through all that so you might be sub consciously thinking; what now? what do i have to focus on? having depression/anxiety can be a very lonely place it can be a mixture of feeling very alone but also not doing things to engage and pushing people away feeling no one cares unfortunately people lead such busy lives for one reason or another have you been able to talk to any of your family to explain how you feel? it sounds with the psychologist (not sure if thats the exact title i cant refer back to your post whilst typing) that you really need someone you can have a two way dialogue with im not sure by just talking at someone will necessarily provide a full and satisfactory experience its a bit of an odd form of communication when u receive very little feedback im sure others might suggest help and support from charities but not sure how things like that work out where you are is there anyway you could become more involved with grandchildren? please forgive me if i havent all the facts just trying to think of things which might help trying to introduce enjoyable things or activities with meaning often help could you volunteer for a charity? sometimes by helping others this can help people to feel needed and worthy small steps towards a bigger eventual goal are often key to getting better having more things in life with meaning can help with self confidence self esteem and having more things to focus on i know its far from easy and its important not to run before you can walk but gradually trying to introduce a few new experiences might help long term best wishes x,0

cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness are key treatments in therapy you can look these up on the net and gets some tips on things you can actively do to help yourself since you cant see a psychologist you can get mindfulness apps for your phone to not only practice but to use when you are having an anxiety attack the tools have been a godsend to me,1
i too am schizoaffective disorder bipolar type i finished school though it took me 4 years to get an associate degree due to the medical leaves of absences i had to take i also have anxiety especially in social sets i clean houses for money most of the time i am getting married in a month agree with others keep appointments get a good therapist try dbt maybe emdr,1
all i can say is that i hope that you will get back into school and dont let your fears and anxieties stop you i know it is very hard but you will be that much prouder of your achievements knowing what you go to to get things done i used to go to work in high anxiety every day i said a prayer i heard somewhere i said to god god i know that nothing is going to happen to me today that you and i can not handle together that prayer helped because when ever anything happened i knew that god was with me i faced the situations i believed much more in myself,0
i have bipolar ptsd awful social anxiety clinical depression and some other things easier to say im a hot mess i had kids young and got married young i have put my husband and family through hell and back my family bailed on me however my husband is still with me he know before i do sometimes that im going to my dark place i am so glad this man has stuck by me seeing how im not the people he married anyway thats my story i could go on forever its good to have someplace where you can talk without judgement,0

im sorry about that glad you have disability that helps take some worry away does your county offer any type of counseling? mine does and thats who prescribes my meds i went to counseling for about 2 years and it helped but i quit going last year im tired of talking about my past im trying to focus to my health and my life im 50 years old and i speak from experience that it can get better i have a hard time with crowds over like 20 people i go to church that is very small and most of the people are very elderly that helps me because it helps my need to care for someone and i can be myself and they love me i can relate to being 20 and having issues you have my prayers and support,0
yes with both zoloft and mirtazapine (or any antidepressant really)  made me 10000x worse i was irritable aggressive and really suicidal if you have bipolar then antidepressants may not be the best thing for you i would be speaking to your doc again asap to review your meds no they shouldnt make you feel like that,1
you have to allow yourself to grieve but keep taking care of yourself talking about it here or in any place you feel safe to is a good start i got a dog a few years ago and she changed my life for the better in more ways than i can describe youre sad and thats okay trust yourself to find another passion to get motivated about maybe reading to people in the hospital or nursing homes or perhaps just dropping in to visit everybody needs encouragement and to know that someone cares that goes for you as well dont be afraid to ask for what you need people that love you want to help but usually dont know how,0
hi there so sorry to hear things are so difficult phew you have a lot going on no wonder you might be struggling forgive me but im uncertain if you are in the uk or us so not sure as to the support which is available to you firstly a little around bereavement loss and grief when someone has been a carer for any length of time if the person they are caring for dies this can leave a huge void for the bereaved not only can you grieve for them deeply regardless of the relationship but your whole purpose and role has disappeared overnight you provided such a valuable and worthwhile lifeline and service which you knew helped so much so when thats all gone it is perfectly feasible that you will literally feel redundant personal loss in any form can leave the bereaved feeling lost alone or abandoned caring for someone as much as you did can also mean the person left behind is just no longer needed dealing with grief for anyone can be so hard let along someone who may have other difficulties such as mental health problems the impact can be far more severe death is very hard to comprehend sometimes how can someone be there so close one day and so far away the next? we need logic in our lives to understand and make any sense death robs us of that recovery from the loss of a loved one and coming to terms with the grief is usually most effective if we can learn to manage the grief finding a way forward to build a new life with new purpose where you can feel needed once again and but holding onto those precious memories of our loved ones ive noticed many others have suggested good possible ways of moving forward a new interest putting your wonderful talents and qualities to a good and valuable use and to help you feel valued again so you can hopefully begin to feel as though you are providing a worthwhile service to someone or something in the case of a pet or animal charity there are so many deserving causes which im sure would love to have someone such as yourself volunteering when i was at an all time low my goal eventually was to do some worthwhile voluntary work get a meaningful job and to do a course to learn something new as well as several other things which would help such as exercise a healthy diet and sunlight etc none of these things happen overnight and to me it was small but significant steps towards an eventual goal its not easy of course i wont pretend it is but it is possible but you also need to lean on those who care and engage with outside help too if it is available ie professionals and charities sorry to run on not trying to preach just thinking of anything which might just help best wishes xx,0
i am so sorry for your loss i lost my mother april 15 of 2009 it sent me into a tailspin after the reality set in i was manic for over a year from that i suggest taking action now before anything gets worse be proactive 100% the outcome is never good from a manic episode and add the anxiety on top of that its just horrible my love goes out to you and i hope you find peace ❤️,0
i too suffer from bipolar ii and anxiety instead of changing up your medicines maybe you could just add a temporary medication to help you through this time,1
i also have bipolar and have been on a lot of different medications im not sure they even work half the time so im fostering kittens its the only reason i get up or stay up i also have a service dog coming soon so ill have to train her ( i dont know how thats going to seeing how i also have extreme social anxiety) im not sure any of that helped im so sorry for your loss,1
its ok to grieve and to go through a grieving stage it doesnt mean you wont get out of it dont be automatically afraid of that that said volunteering at a hospital or animal shelter may help motivate you especially since people will be expecting you to show up so you will have to get out of bed,0
i would say get a dog from a rescue place my husband got one for me about five years ago after suffering from a life threatening sickness when made it through that i was alone most of the time other then my nurses but when i got marley he was like a god sent he would not leave my other then going out he was the best present my husband ever gave me i had something more to l focus on,0
puppies are great! one would help with stress youre used taking care of someone trust me i know how it feels so sorry for your loss and may god bless you,1
after i lost my husband eight yrs ago my anxiety got so bad my stomach hurts constantly it got so bad i just quit eating cause i knew if i eat it would just make my stomach hurt more i had test after test ran i have gastritis now caused by stress is what the doctor told me the anxiety and stress cause ur stomach to create more stomach acid which eats thru the liner of ur stomach i lost over eighty pounds my family accused me of being on drugs but its all from anxiety and yes my boyfriend would get irritated with me wen i would say how bad my stomach hurt he would say u always hurt its always something which just makes u feel worse about ur self you need to talk to ur doctor there is a medicin to help with the stomach that he can put on u on,0
i can relate on many levels i have severe anxiety and became addicted to clonazepam due to a doctor prescribing more and more im now working on a taper off of it i have also had awful digestive/gi issues a few months ago i started on a probiotic system called plexus which works to improve gut health i have seen improvements with my gi issues they also have another supplement which has been shown to help with anxiety im going to try that when i have more money i get how frustrating all of this is,1
hey there ive had uncontrollable diarrhea for over 9 years now they keep saying its just ibs but ended up taking out my gallbladder due to it being unable to contract because it was full of stones (causing pain under the lower right ribs) but also this is where your liver is have you been checked for elevated liver enzymes? i wasnt until recently and i was diagnosed w fatty liver disease(also called non-alcoholic liver disease) now when i say diarrhea for 9 years im not exaggerating at all it started when i was 21 im now almost 31 it was also painful bloating swelling of my abdomen to the point of looking 6-7 months pregnant nausea loss of appetite and so on apparently my stomach was moving the food through too fast and not allowing time to absorb nutrition from the food leaving me w 6 vitamin deficiencies my dr prescribed an antispasmodic for me about 3 months ago the difference is night and day!!! 3 gastroenterologist couldnt help me after multiple endoscopies and colonoscopies but one dr who listened actually helped i now barely bloat can finish a meal without multiple bathroom breaks and am starting to fit into my clothing again i hope this information helps you please note im also on antidepressants anti-anxiety medication and anti psychotics so it may be a group effort in getting your tummy on track,1
i have some of the same issues when i get to anxious i get really sick the stress eats my inside i have gerd now which is acid reflex due to my anxiety i also experience constipation a lot i know its very hard and people dont understand why or how we go through what we have but you are not alone you should seek out a gastrointestinal doctor to prescribe you anti acids they have helped for me a loti also take once in awhile amitza which helps constipation i hope that helps good luck!,1
ive had digestive issues due to anxiety since i was a kid i was involved in music and theatre and would either throw up or have uncontrollable diarrhea before i performed it got even worse after i had my gallbladder out if i had errands to run and was going to eat out eating had to be last because i would have to go straight home they used to call ibs having a "nervous stomach" so yes anxiety can manifest itself through your digestive system,1
it do cause digestive problems when i get depressed and anxious i loose appetite i have lost 23 kg in two to three months my meds work just for few days then no effect i also immagine getting worse disease  yesterday was hell,1
medications always have side effects for my 34 year old son he is either constipated or running to the bathroom he has developed thyroid issues from a drug he is no longer on he also has bad acid reflux and is on prescription nexium depression can make you feel bad or imagine things and then when you really are sick it makes you more depressed this is from observing him for years my middle son also suffers from depression the you 34 year old is bipolar when my middle son calls me and tells me things that i think are unworthy of him worrying about when he is depressed i tell him to put those worries on the shelf they arent worth worrying about it has taken him a long time to learn to put things on the shelf but he is doing it now and much better for it god speed to you!,1
have you tried a medication called buspar- it is a nonaddictive option for the anxiety and that is the primary use for it i too have a lot of gi symptoms that on occasion make me sure something serious is happening but i am a medical professional so i keep trying to talk myself down- recently had a ct scan of the abdomen which is the gold standard for diagnosis of serious problems so i know it is just the anxiety i started the buspar a few months ago- worked up to 15 tablets twice a day but blurred vision made me contact my md who changed it to 2 tablets at bedtime- good relief of the blurred vision but has left me a little more anxious due to the decreased dose so i will contact him again like all meds hard to find the perfect dose at the get go but we keep trying give the elavil a try it works for many gi symptoms bipolar 1 x 40 years,1
im finding these posts really annoying!! i am bipolar with depression and anxiety i work my ass off to be the best i can be!! rather that than spout how im up then down and get scared bla bla bla!!! i am bipolar and proud that every day i do my very best to be amazing!!! rant over,1
forgive me as im not aware of this schoeffective disorder and couldnt find anything online so ill just consider the anxiety as that is something i have more experience of as a mother of a teenage son with acute anxiety it can be so so hard as a parent we want to fix things make everything ok and if we cant we can feel so helpless its such an awful feeling to see your son suffer so much acute anxiety can be so crippling many people just dont realise some even completely dont understand or wrongly assume we just want to make everything ok and when we cant we can feel a failure at times when sometimes there just isnt anything we can do to make things ok with my son one of the main things he needed and relied upon was my strength resilience understanding and knowing i was always there for him through thick and thin if i was to falter or push him into something he wasnt happy with then i know he couldnt have coped i believe they need loved ones to understand and be there for them it is hard enough to deal with the problems it makes everything so much worse when they believe people dont understand one of most frustrating things ive found about mental illness is the slow rate of recovery and being able to move forward it can take so long to build up the confidence needed to be able to do things when we crave the day when our children and young people can essentially be able to live a normal life it can be heartbreaking to see them struggling with a half life battling with their demons on a daily basis when we see others their peers living happy fruitful and care free lives it is so hard to know what our young people are going through especially when we see their youth disappearing not being able to fulfill their potential not being happy sometimes its just too painful to really contemplate and its better for our own sanity to just focus on the here and now and try to put our energies into the daily challenges because progress can seem so painfully slow eg getting a job learning to drive its important to try to focus on smaller steps smaller goals by gentle encouragement and with kind praise and empathic reinforcement it has to be more their pace than ours as frustrating as it often is quite often unfortunately the pressure this brings on us has adverse effects and can lead to mental health problems for the parent/s who bare the lions share of the stress we arent always strong enough which makes things extra hard do you have any other professional support for you or your son? it can feel so isolating when you see others effectively leading normal lives things can get better its finding that way forward to beat the conditions so they can control it rather than it controlling them this can come with maturity and using each productive experience as evidence that they have overcome their anxiety on a particular day or in a specific activity im sure you are doing a wonderful job and together as a team things will get better but unfortunately it can take a lot of time care and patience best wishes x,0
marilyn corrado ah yes i can see the symptoms now apologies for that i guess too you are in the us and im in the uk so unfortunately services and provision are different there it sounds to me you are a brilliantly supportive and insightful mum im sure your son knows how lucky he is to have your continued support i know with mine he relies so heavily on me which as you describe can feel as though you are doing everything in your power for him but on the flip side it can feel such a weight a pressure to make everything ok it can seem as though you have to fight so hard for everything to get him into the best school for his needs didnt sound easy but you did it and it probably good for him in many ways but clearly he is struggling with the whole idea of being around like minded people that is one of the most difficult areas i really struggled with the whole issue of how to sell the idea of having a mental illness to my son his problems started at the age of ten and i didnt want to label him i didnt want him to be defined by it to think that this was how it was always going to be like you i wanted it to be talked about no secrets or white lies as such but i also wanted to give him hope that it wouldnt be like this forever even though of course i had no proof of that its all so difficult and sometimes as parents we have to make these constant difficult decisions we have no handbook how do we know what to do and say for the best? all we can do is try our best for him to not want to engage or socialise with the others does sound understandable he wants to feel normal he wants to be a normal teenager in a way i didnt really want to take him to workshops or courses for mental illness as it seemed to me that i would be confirming that this was to be his life it is a really hard thing to know whats for the best sometimes but sometimes it is only those who suffer who truly understand its got to be the right person i suppose for him to relate to and to feel an affinity with its not easy yes peer support and meeting others in similar situations can really help sometimes are there any charities which have meetings? although of course these might not be able to access if your son feels particularly anxious does he engage with understanding people through social media would you know? this seems to be the most common means nowadays it must be difficult for you when you have other children as well do you have avenues to be able to do things for you and people to support you? unfortunately as frustrating it is we cant just fix them my son who is also 17 has had very bad long periods of suffering anxiety but he is slowly moving forwards has recently secured a job and is starting to build a better life he is far from cured of course and lives quite an insular life but there is hope and im sure you will get there but depression as a result of acute anxiety is a real possibility and a challenge to ideally avoid or if not treat xx,0
thank you his school has his psych and therapist which he sees 2x a week and then when needed i go 1x a week or more if needed i want to just fix him i am his best friend and that breaks my heart we do everything together which in turn can be trying on my patience i then have to take some time alone and regroup i have other boys so they all need something the process is so very slow for recovery but he has improved beyond words over the past year so i have to focus on that i just see that he gettting depressed since hes almost 17 and just not able to do what the others are doing you wrote a beautiful response and i appreciate that i wish there were group for parents like aa meetings so we can meet others seems many parents are reserved about their children with illnesses we are open about it as i feel this is nothing to be ashamed of i fought for years to finally get him into the school he is in and its been the best thing for him the problem with the school is that he wont let himself connect with any of the kids there as he says they are all "weird" but they are all like my son some worse some not but he cant accept the he has a disability and keeps fighting it i am hoping once he accepts it and just knows that the anxiety is his norm for now he may enjoy life a little more,0
i was diagnosed at 14 i am now 33 schizo affective bi polar with anxiety ocd and agoraphobia its tough but he sounds like a true fighter i have never been able to hold a job and my ability to go out comes and goes but i fight im a mom and a gf and a daughter and a sister and now an aunt too and those things make me fight harder he will get to where he suppose to be and will work out hugs for support and any questions or someone to chat too you or your son just inbox me hope this helps,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page never assume its only one person that is damaged,1
did its scary,0
i m there now but starting fresh is going to be the hard part for me my fiancé left me on friday we been together for 16 years cant get her out of my head my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression is very high right now dont know what to do ,1
hope you dont really feel that way i have been depressed and had extreme anxiety my whole life and i know god put me here for a reason i have great memories and future plans please get help you dont have to feel that way,0
i have very similar symptoms to yours and am also not sure if i am bipolar 2 my son was diagnosed but a psychiatrist told me i was a borderline case i am just utterly confused because the lows are so bad i just want die and then it gets better again till the next time i am not on any meds at the moment have been on so many different meds over the years and cant really say they made much difference,1
i too am diagnosed with bp2 i am currently taking medication its constantly an on and off cycle for me ive also noticed if i track my nutrients such as b vitamins folate and magnesium specifically in my diet i can maintain a more stable mood its hard because for 10 years ive tried to figure out patterns nowadays i know if i wake up with a bunch of energy and i start organizing or cleaning or trying to do everything at once i know im in a manic moment its an every day struggle but for me tracking my moods and what nutrients i am in taking have really helped i use cronometer for nutrient tracking n i journal for mood patterns information and structured routine is key for me also its very difficult to meditate but i try to because that also puts me in a much better mood afterwards,1
bp2 can have a depressed/manic ratio of 40:1 which means youll experience chronic depression with bouts of hypomania so it sounds like that may be what youre experiencing remember manic isnt always happy and feeling great it can also be just irrational and irratable behavior really anything where you have pent up energy that doesnt go away periods of pent up energy that manifests in negative emotions and actions are probably a mixed state which is when you have to be very mindful and aware as they can be the most dangerous part of living with bipolar i would journal as much as you can details about how you feel when you feel that way things you do how you act triggers that send you into depressed states or irritable or manic etc this can really help a psychiatrist see a pattern that makes it easier to diagnose whatever is going on,0
it took a year of my psych working with me for them to finally say bp2 even with my history past hospitalization etc she started medicating and witnessed me in one mixed state and then headed into one hypomanic episode before finally shifting from major depressive disorder anxiety and ptsd to the bipolar it definitely could be bipolar from what youre describing just please be prepared for them to be cautious in making the diagnosis it takes time im glad youre taking steps and wish you well,1
that sounds like a mixed state my friend common with bp2 listen to your dr and to your own sense of well-being ask questions be informed and dont be afraid to ask for support when you need it,0
i have discovered that industrial rock is a good remedy for depression and anxiety,1
im totally confused,0
endep the benzos just make me stupid seroquel was ok for a couple of months (when it first started) but increased my night terrors 10 fold endep is a bit of a head numb at first but like everything fails im stuffed im waiting on a sleep clinic only for 3 years i cant wait to see their faces when i do sleep its straight into intense dreaming (nightmares) then awake dreaming awake so i get no rest i sit up ill roll onto one side and prop myself up waking an hour later to find my head welded to my shoulder takes a few screaming minutes i have a totally fkd spine c1c2 fused then bulging discs in 9 spots if you looked down on my spine from above its a corkscrew had a couple of operations ok for a while sciatica in both legs thoracic spine is cactus last 3 fingers on each hand are 75% numb no help there until they get worse ahhh public health sorry for the whinge,1
my daily struggle,0
it tends to be when we surrounded by douches we become a product of our environment if you know your lifestyle is improper you deserve your misery because you earned itwe reap what we sowyou can always replant and try againtheres still time,0
what med combo are you on now ? i always keep clonazpam on me for anxiety really helps,1
have had so many meds ive lost count each one has their own side effects over the the las ten years after a psychotic episode and being diagnosed bipolar anti depressants make me high as a kite but it only took psychiatrist 9 years to come to that conclusion now im now on meds that keep me on the low side of steady they keep me out of hospital but i am so depressed/anxiety that i hate waking up in the morning frightened of what mood ill be in and how im going to cope most ways also have lost all friends as i havent been fit to work for 30 years i can understand they need to move on but why cant they give me the odd phone call im a decent person and know i could never do that to them also being in and out of hospital you meet people think theyre friends and we swap phone numbers but if youre kind hearted you soon realise they only want you for what you can give them  so i now realise theyre not any good for me i havent been in hospital for 3 years and although im low i pray i dont want to go back again just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience and cant see your way out of it xx,0
yes kevin we have to take it but im frightened what side effects they cause xx,0
i openly talk with people about my bipolar disorder i tell them what i take how my mood varies how i know if i need my meds adjusted i am not ashamed of people knowing because its not who i am it just a part of who i am,1
seems like they cant find a danm thing to fix me an my anxiety,1
tell him you dobut can i tell you something as you age life and love changes form and what you desire atm may not be what you always desire keep that in mind while you worry about loosing him this pain will pass,0
i wont i already trird that and it didnt work and im afraid if i do ill lose him as a friend,0
im bipolar ii and only on effexor right now i need something for anxiety but im,1
im on exactly that combo for mdd and panic disorder,0
im on celexa for anxiety & depressionyoure right celexa causes a low sex drive! also on lamotrigine for mood stabilizer,1
i pretty sure u need a moid stabilizer w bipolar 2 none of those are mood stabilizers anxiety will be lower w mood stabilizer prob wont need ativan and is ur dr using gabapentin for anxiety may not need that if dr ordered u a mood stabilizer,1
i was on gabapentin side effects were so bad id shake so bad and be up 10+ times a night weeing im on cymbalta now its pretty good,0
every one has different reactions and body chemistry im not sure what you are asking? i take a mood stabilizer antidepressant and an anti anxiety i cant take benzodiazepines because of my addictive behavior if what your taking works then stay with it if you are concerned or feel you need something different ask your doctor if you arent seeing a psychiatrist it would help you to do so always give your meds time but also dont rely on others opinions yours and your psychiatrist are what matters good luck!,1
zoloft gabapentin and xanax ptsd and bipolar 2 gabapentin made me forgetful so they put me on lamictal but if i hadnt been so air headed i would have stayed on it since for me the combo was amazing for the anxiety and mood swings,1
on gabapentin and lorazepam gabapentin more for diabetic nerve pain i am type 2 with anxiety take wellbutrin paxil buspar and trazadone for indomnia,1
i have type 2 with anxiety im on zoloft and lithium,0
yes im bp2 with adhd depression anxiety i was on zoloft for a long time and i didnt seem to have any major problems the worst side effect was that it took away my sex drive,1
i only have depression n anxiety havent been said what level but i am only on 120mg cymbalta,1
alll for my anxiety they say,1
i have type 2 with anxiety and am on xanax aswell i was on valluim but went down hill quick a doc that specialist in this told me that the valluim runs off the same receptor in the brain as the bipolar disorder medication hence going down hill but i find this works for me but each person is different hope this helps,1
im a little concerned about your dose of lamotrigine the max daily dose should only be 200 mg anything above that is not any more effective and may lead to a greater risk of developing adverse events,0
bipolar 2 generalized anxiety and ptsd here i take trileptal 900 mg daily (3 300 mg pills 1 morning and 2 at night) 300 mg bupropion xr in the morning and 100 mg of trazadone and 50mg of seroquel with trileptal at night i also have valium to take as needed for severe anxiety attacks,1
lamitcal abilify hydroxyzine propanalol for anxiety mdd and bipolar ii,0
i on celexa ampilfy xanax and gabapentin but i do take other meds for diabetes and other ailments i am bipolar with severe depression and anxiety,1
if that is the combination that works ok but injectible abilify? you can take that orally it is a horrible drug; i personally had bad reactions to it at the forefront was akathisia lamotrigine didnt do anything for me clonazepam helped anxiety for awhile but stopped working so did xanax i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder the combination that ends up working for me is 450 mg lithium carbonate er and 100 mg sertraline for some reason yes my body needs an ssri everyones biochemistry is different unfortunately it takes "playing the medication game" a few times before finding the right combination of medication this really does seem like overkill but i am not the doc either also it really depends on if youre functioning and happy if you are youre in the right place for now!,1
sertraline 100mg deppression n anxiety,1
bipolar 2 and anxiety 200mg lemetrogen 20mg saphris 30mg temazepam,0
bipolar ll adhd ptsd guess im lucky: 150 mg zoloft 100 mg strattera and 25 mg xanax for panic attacks,0
i am down to depakote and effexor i have been on them a long time eighteen years and in the past two months was able to decrease them i was on naproxen and allergy meds meds get mixed up together and cause more side effects like depression i had an episode where my liver and kidney enzymes were higher than normal this year and being 61 i am taking that to heart i have alpha 1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency anyone with liver disease or lung disease of any kind should be tested for this taking the liver damaging medications if you have this condition can kill your liver i was taking tylenol twice a day 1000 mg just to keep going with arthritis this is hard on the kidneys i take it but as needed now i am in pain and i am stiff and some days i cant do much at all but i do not want to die from liver failure or kidney failure these things can happen and they can be silent until the damage is great we cant just pop pills we have to do other stuff to be emotionally healthy we have to stay engaged emotionally and have relationships with people that will help us reality test and ground us this is not to say that we should not make our own decisions we must but others around us can help us make good decisions we cant let our mental illness isolate us or think of ourselves as different because of psych diagnoses we gotta push through the emotions get hurt forgive and learn all we can about what to be like and not be like from our encounters with others also our need for mental health drugs changes over time sometimes we just have to settle down and not allow ourselves to get so upset we have to learn coping and calming strategies we did not learn before no matter what age we are every day is a new day a lot of people advocate for exercise meditation the arts etc i read the bible and pray i seek gods help to live a christian life to be a loving person it is easy to be selfish and grouchy or self centered and depressed we dont have to give in to it for me rest goes a long way getting along with others can be tough if you are a parent you cant always do what you want because of others needs you compromise a lot life goes on you live and learn hopefully you will not need so many meds for a really long time if you need them you need them dont let them rob you of your life god bless,0
im on 375 of venlafaxine currently 250mg of lamotrigine and also either 75mg zopiclone or 10mg zolpidem plus occasional diazepam i know the venlafaxine dose is pretty high and were working on increasing the lamotrigine too bipolar 2 with anxiety,1
bipolar ii take lamictal and welbutrin only have tried seroquel (caused restless legs and insomnia) abilify (resulted in stomach issues which ended with trip to er and 2 days in hospital) risperidone quetiapine also have chronic insomnia (dont fall asleep until 4 am) so have had numerous sleeping medsmany of which have no effect or the opposite effect (worse insomnia) not sleeping/being tired does nothing to help my bp2,1
i get up in the night too its a horrible restless sleep i feel for u,0
im diagnosed biplolar ll anxiety adhd ocd and antisocial personality disorder im on hydroxyzine 50mg twice a day wellbutrin 150mg zoloft 100mg guanfacine 2mg lamictal 150mg twice a day klonopin i think 2mg twice a day buspar 30mg twice a day lithium 450mg and olanzapine 10mg,0
i suffer from clinical depression chronic anxiety and agoraphobia and im on clomipramine mirtazapine & lorazepam,1
im on citalopram 20mg for depression i deal with anxiety as well but dont take anything for it i take it once a day just be careful taking all those medications ,1
its different for everyone it might not be too much for u i wasnt really allowed to make the desicion most of my life and when i had a panic attack or got depressed my mom saw that as not enough meds be careful and listen to what suits u im on lithium and seraquil ( pretty sure thats how u spell it ) but im on a lil less now at 14 i was on so much lithium i started shaking amd getting dizzy and blurred vision u really just gotta talk to ur doctor,1
and if your dr isnt helping dont hesitate to get a second opinion my psychiatrist took me completely off cipralex abilify and lorazepam and put me on venlafaxine and clonazepam instead with sublinox when necessary and im getting on much better,1
im on seroquelxr 100mg/day luvox 25mg/day trileptal 300mg/3xday i also take 5 klonopin as needed for anxiety attacks but i dont need it a lot i started on less meds and went up to this always start small and work up,1
im on lithium 900 per day mg and lorazepam 3 mg per day as needed and quetiapine 800 mg per night and divalproex (dont remember dosage) i have depresion anxiety and bipolar i need all different meds because they dont work anymore except for the divalproex;its new still having hallucinations and horrible anxiety and mood swings,1
bipolar type 2 & anxiety i take 150 mg lamotragine 2x a day 40 mg latuda 15 mg buspirone 2x a day and 05 mg clonazepam as needed but usually only once a day as well as something for high blood pressure and hypothryroidism just recently started the latuda so still getting used to it rapid cycling a bit now but still seems to be a better combo than what i was on before hopefully it gets better but i do understand its hard to be on a lot of meds but if its working for you thats all that matters! ,1
my meds work fine thanks just thought it may be too much but people in here are on a lot more then me so that makes me feel a bit better an not so panicky,1
klonopin for panic attacks i refuse to take antidepressants,1
yes that is to much i was on a load of meds years ago and i never knew what was doing what i think you need to ask your dr to try you on one thing for bipolar 2 and something for anxiety see if that makes a difference hope this helps x,1
zoe you need to see an intergrative or functional dr - theyre all about looking at the root cause not just symptoms my dr has patients who had severe depression (like me) psychosis debilitating anxiety etc & they all had one thing in common - hormonal and/or nutritional deficiencies i also have a gluten & dairy intolerance plus some issues with my gut health knowing these things & treating the root cause of these problems has changed my life! blessings ,1
yes its an antipsychotic it made me depressed then they put me on a mood stabilizer to balance it out and it worked but still need my clonazepam for anxiety,1
i take 900mg lithium 80mg latuda 20mg zyprexa 600mg seroquel 40mg lexapro and 100mg pristiq three times a day diagnosed with bipolar 1 and paranoid-type schizophrenia im struggling ,0
woah! you do not need to be on 3 antipsychotics (latuda zyprexa seroquel) and an ssri (lexapro) and an snri (pristiq) also pristiq is definitely not dosed 3 times a day im sorry but as a pharmacist i need to let you know that this drug regime is a recipe for disaster there are no additional benefits with doses greater than 50 mg of pristiq same with greater than 20 mg of lexapro anything greater than that puts you at risk of dangerous heart arrhythmias how long have you been taking this regime? did your doctor educate you on the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome? no wonder you are strugglingim so sorry i suggest you see another psychiatrist ‍♀️ i know that this is all unsolicited but as a healthcare professional i could not help it,0
suez goturback fleshman i also use cannabis alot personally it started when i was very alone and depressed as a way to help me cope but even now that im much much more happier and healthier it still is a great mood stabilizer and also helps me manage my sleep schedule a lot better getting a solid 8 hours of sleep every night is one of the most important factors to remaining mentally healthy i try to sleep without it but if my mind is racing i know itll level me out and help me go to sleep and i dont have to worry about insomnia becoming a problem that compounds on my other symptoms but with all of this being said everyone is different everyone reacts to different medications differently but cognitive behavior therapy is the one thing that ive experienced is a "one size fits all" type of treatment that works very well,1
if the combo has relieved you of symptoms dont rock the boat klonopin stays around for some time in your system and can usually get away with taking less than perscribed given you are taking a small dose but a through out the day 2mg which is about a normal michele im not a doctor but i have studied pharmacology to its basics giving adderall with klonopin? that mighy not be a good idea plus adding into gabapentin? ouch doxepin as well? see if your doctor can minimize this combo over time your brain and body are not going to like being up and down like that adderall is certainly something you may do with out as it causes anxiety and can agitate insomnia panic attacks and a schizoaffective disorder,1
ebbie casey my daughter gets so triggered when she goes out her thinking about others gets so mixed up she imagines people are looking at her talking about her etc she imagines that people are other people or that she sees people from her past the stress of going out alone really triggers her she cant be on more meds does anyone have a strategy for getting more comfortable with going out on your own to diminish these reactions?,0
an take some rispiridone and it knocks that "everyone is watching me edge" off im schizo affective adhd bipolar ive had 3 serious nervous break downs i take adderal no its probably not the best idea ( elvis) but as doctor says and i agree " it helps my patient focus and finish projects or chores it helps him live a somewhat normal life with out this medicine my life becomes a mess the house turns into a maze of unfinished cleaning and projects my brain thinks to fast and i sometimes struggle to keep up with myself the adderal lifts me up a bit yes not that much it then helps me to slow down and think things out to properly finish everything i start and i dont fidget and squirm ur right probably not the best combo for everyone but i simply take rispiridone to knock off that nasty edge,0
i was guinea pigged with vistaril and it had no reaction with me prob ably because its original intended use is for blood pressure i got so tired of being put on meds that had other intended uses and treating anxiety was just a possible side effect,1
i am on prozac abilify adderall klonopin doxepin and gabapentin but i was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar disorder ptsd add ocd generalized anxiety disorder bereavement insomnia panic disorder with social anxiety and agoraphobia,1
the ability to sleep regularly having a good appetite but not overeating being able to take care of ourselves and not take unnecessary risks having a manageable anxiety level having the ability to think and be organized being motivated to get out of bed in the morning not being too irritable being able to listen to people without interrupting being able to express ourselves well being able to work towards some satisfaction in life being able to have some self worth some peace of mind and good solid relationships are all things we want to have in our lives if our moods or our mixed up thinking is interfering with these things then we need the meds,1
thanks its not always easy but i have to push through cant let my kids see me struggling on my bad days i sometimes have to go in bathroom and splash water to cover the fact i was crying but my kids (17 & 10) keep me going along with my therapy cat,0
i use seroquel for bipolar one and anxiety its s great feud but careful with ur weight ,1
as far as me (since it is completely different for everyone) i have been on 900 mgs of seroquel when i was really bad in highschool for 6 months and functioned great i mean it put me out immediately so i only took it at night but the next day i was as normal as possible it made me gain weight quickly currently i am only on 75 of seroquel and only take more if its an emergency and i just need to sleep through it cymbalta i was on it for around 7 years until it became useless to me after brain chemistry changes it helped keep me stable and was good for my depression i assume it helped with my overall anxiety and ocd not sure though,1
lots of ugly on seroquel lol it is highly effective at treating anxiety/psych issues if you dont mind eating the house down makes you starving!!!!! and lots of people gain serious weight myself 60#,1
no real issues with low dose seroquel yet just make sure you have 8+ hours to sleep after taking it otherwise you might be a zombie the next day cymbalta - believe your doc when they say do not stop taking it without consulting the doc; the withdrawal symptoms range from annoying to potentially life-threatening,1
dont know about cymbalta but seroquel has changed my life i love it taken my psychosis symptoms to very manageable hardly any paranoia sleep amazing and anger problems sorted right out its not ideal during day cos it does knock you out so need to slightly cut dose but worth it for the benefits also i did gain nearly 3 stone but have managed to lose it and maintain the loss,1
put on like 20kgs with seroquel in like 6 weeks so came of that cymbals was great to start with but anxiety levels were high and it stopped working after about 6mths,1
thinking of reducing my dose actually has certainly curbed my anxiety,1
seroquel knocked me out my maintenance guy came by to fix the sink i tried to get up but couldnt move my body was asleep but i could hear him talking weight gain as well ive been on cymbalta for 3yrs and helps with my depression im back on ativan for anxiety though i am feeling much better now,0
withdraws from cymbaltaba were horrid i had to go into the hospital for 2weeks until physical symptoms were relieved a bit but it took months before mental symptoms started to clear i would much rather have withdrawn from an opiate,1
seroquel keeps me very stable however i was in too deep of sleeps and was afraid i wouldnt wake up so i just had my dose lowered,1
cymbalta is the o ly anti depressant that worked for me  it didnt help with anxiety they tried me on 120mg and it made me sick and it didnt help with pain  medications react differently for different people though i took myself off the cymbalta and i was taking 5mg of abilify they were working but my bf said pills poison you blah blah so all i take now is valium and if i take trazadone sometimes it knocks me out for a whole day and i cant have that i think its similar to serequel i was 50mg 1-3 as needed though,1
been on cymbalta for years and it helps with my anxiety without it my head would be spinning the bad (at least for me) when it gets close to the time of my dose i experience anxiety- chest tightening and all so just make sure you dont miss doses,1
i have bipolar 1 and i was put on 600 mg of lithium and 3 mg of risperidone i recently got that decreased to 1 mg though i havent been manic is over a year and i feel mostly good! my dad passed away from lung cancer last august and im struggling to find a job so im depressed and anxious about that but thats understandable,0
i take lamictal and when they took me off tegretol they doubled the lamictal dose and tolld it would hold me- did not happen- had a horrible long mania so they ended up putting me back on tegretol and keeping the lamictal as well- for me lamictal just was not enough if you are having mania then you need more of a mood stabilizer plus a new doctor if she/he will not listen to you no doc should be threatened when we do research into our condition- we are the ones living with it not them i have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for 40 years or so,1
they use drugs like limictil and tegratol which are anti seizure meds but for mood stabilizer they slow down the brain enough it stabilizes mood so it doesnt matter if you have one or two im on tegratol and it has saved my life nothing else has ever worked so well if youre doing well i wouldnt worry about it,1
im bi polar ocd add autism anxiety over 9000,1
if its working x dont worry they only say that because it seems to help more with the depression side of things which bipolar 2 peeps seem to suffer more from i am bp2 and just tried it last resort getting desperate and i had a life threatening reaction to it so count yourself lucky youve found something that works i have been battling rapid cycling and major depression looking for the right meds for 2 years now but im overly sensitive to everything the only thing saving me at the moment is valium and lots of it trust me if it works dont worry what its meant for which is actually epilepsy by the way ,1
lamictal made me barf its not worth it then they tried many othersprozac in am zyprexa in pm im not happy to report that the side effects lamictal made me so sick in 2 days all the others ive taken over 20 years were never worth i just treat my anxiety with xanax ( small dosage) and hydroxizine ( visteral) which helps with anxiety,1
i have bipolar 2 im also on lamictal i take it with my lithium i would think that as long as the medication is working and its treating the bipolar i would try not to stress too much about if its for bp one or two,1
lamictol is a great mood stabilizers why he going off cymbalta? he must be very careful as withdrawal from it is frightening,0
i have always taken my lamictal in one dose asked my dr if i could she looked up the half life & told me i could its more convenient & i dont miss doses some drs tell me it needs to be in 2 doses yet ive never had any of them look up the half life i continued to take it in one dose but i tell the dr whatever they want to hear lamictal is a mood stabilizer abilify is an anti-psychotic medication lexapro zoloft etc are anti-depressant drugs be careful not to compare these drugs to one another it would be like comparing apples to oranges lastlycheryl berndt you are confused genetic disorders like bipolar depression gad adhd are treatable with medications things like ptsd narcissistic personality disorder stockholm syndrome etc are also mental illnesses yet these are some types of mental illnesses that medication does little for they are not a chemical imbalance,1
latuda works wonders for me and xanax for anxiety,1
the gene for my anxiety is slc6a4 according to bipolar writer and psychiatrist k r jamison the identification of a gene for bipolar is definitive,1
if his condition is genetically inherited he is actually his real self in which case no intake of any form of medication will alleviate any of the symptoms associated with the illness moreover uninhabited illnesses exacerbate the inherited ones which are marginally aided by medications  my inherited illnesses are generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder exacerbated by acquired borderline personality disorder rapid cycling moods ptsd and ocd the powerful medications i am on set me off into a middle-of-the-road dimension as i remain marginally well,1
hi i was on it for anxiety and depression and its a good medication just it can have extreme side effect that you should familiar yourself with if your partner breaks out into a rash call your doctor immediately,1
been on it almost 4 months have had a slow steady increase of dozage over quite a period of time dont know yet if it will work for me over a longer period of time sideeffects? hmm for the last 3-4 weeks ive had very bad anxiety - a type ive never experienced before its been so bad that its led me to develop pattern of ocd-like thinking and actions this anxiety makes me exhausted also more irritated (borderline aggressive) mentioned this "new" to my caregiver since i myself think this anxiety level and mood may be sideeffects of lamictal however psychiatrist does not think so dont know if others have experienced similar(by the way; am swedish and over here the drug often is called lamotrigin),0
only thing that keeps me going is earning a bit more money and often main reason i dont commit suicide is because i dont want my siblings to inherit my share of the family fortune how sad is that? i cant tolerate anyones opinions i cant get on with "friends" i take everything seriously i dont go to meetings because i get really stressed out with people there i am an artist apparently very good according to a well established art expert and artist who loves my paintings  but i cant stand working with anyone especially other students (i am at college) i fall out with just about everyone then want to be alone i am huge misfit  i had gender reassignment nearly 3 years ago but now feel really depressed about what i did my love life is pretty good i have a lover who looks after me and i am fairly well off plenty spare cash because i am always selling things i dont get on with my father who doesnt understand me or my kids i live on my own with my cat ironically i get really lonely but i cant stand company  yes i did get diagnosed with aspergers/adhd 5 years agoi came of anti depressants in feb and feel better in some ways but i think about killing myself every day even though i am better off than lots of people have a lot of freedom have two cars nice house nice cat only thing i am really good at is art and i hate everyone else in the art world there so full of crap for a woman i am strange as i am obsessed with motor cars i started drinking again after being of alcohol for ten years but dont feel right drinking now as a female as i did when male i hate being transgender very few seem to understand my life is in a relative "state of calm "yet i want to end it maybe i am fueled by disaster and prefer disaster,0
i totally agree with the first comment i too have a great life a truly amazing wife a brilliant (although admittedly sometimes stressful) job great friends about to move to a lovely new house and the future is looking great however i still want to pick up the courage to jump off the nearest bridge i have the urge but thankfully am resisting the urge to self harm every day its not circumstances its the brain doing stupid things! keep your head up we are all here for you x,0
depression is not situational dependent - depression is a mental illness that can hit anyone at any age at any time there can be certain personality traits that are more susceptible or often connected to depression - however this does not mean that those without these indicators are not at risk for this illness,1
i take it along with anti depression and anxiety med! im stable and with blood work 2 times a year healthy,1
i thonk and eham bamm that were i am good bad ugly or indifferently numbed or anxious or joyful,1
sometimes when i get nervous or anxious i get paranoid,0
oh my im going through the same exact thing! im worried i wont be able to hold down this job long enoughwhat happens when i go through something else and i cant get my disability back? im also a good fighter but sometimes i just want to stay home and think all day about everything i mean everything! then i get paranoid and depressed im a wreck but i need the money,0
i havent worked since i was diagnosed 5 years ago i did start volunteering at a local aquarium one day a week it was a stretch physically but mentally and emotionally too being around crowds interacting with strangers no down-time some days i had to retreat to the stairwell just to clear my head it got easier each time just factor in the physical stress of doing something new and know that will effect you emotionally as well,0
since you seem to be uncertain have you thought about taking a baby step??? like maybe school first??? then work??? or maybe like a babysitting job??? or a hobby you can take up to occupy your time??? i would hate for you to go all the way in if youre not completely ready cuz it would make you feel even worse been there,0
yep no interest in anything i work third shift am almost always sitting around by myself lonely as fuck but anxious when im around people have nothing to say b-day 46 is coming up and i see nothing but a steady decline nothing to look forward to no hope killing time while its killing me watching life go by,0
i been taken it now for about 5months and still hasnt been affectively doing anything doctors keep trying everything with itmy body fighting itnow with latunda lets seeall i want is to get some sleepi only get 2 hrs a day and feel horribleany suggestions????,0
it makes you feel out of control when not in it your mad sad you want to cry at everything you cant sleep you fell off it awful i have been in it 15 years now my insurance says they no longer pay for it i dont know what im going to do im so scared i will get so sick plus im a ex drug addict im scared ill use to ease my pain so what ever you do try and keep your head up,0
it was horrible for me i went off slowly and according to the doctors orders still withdrawals sucked,0
horrible was zombie 24/7 sleeping 17 hrs a night,1
i was on a low dose of seroquel to help me sleep and help my moods it did the trick except for 1 side effect i had the most terrifying nightmares in my life i would wake up feeling so anxious it wasnt worth the stress cut cold turkey with no symptoms but again it was a low dose i tried trazadone after that and had hangover symptoms (nausea vomiting migraines) now im on invega i dont snap as much or as easily as i used to but still dont sleep well,1
i quit cold turkey not gonna sugar coat it shit was the same as withdrawing from meth (3years sober) for me couldnt eat stomach hurt all the time couldnt sleep shaky paranoid the list goes on,0
i had bad anxiety i dint sleep for 3 days not even a nap,1
i was prescribed seroquel with lamictal and had a horrible allergic reaction extremely high fever and broke out in a rash after reading these comments im thankful i had that reaction,0
i did seroquel with lamictal it gave me severe reactions ive been taking lamictal for years but the combination was horrible i now do lamictal with effexor it seems to work for me,1
thats the only medication combo that has given me a reaction my doctor just prescribed me zoloft a few months ago i had just came off of lithium she literally said to me "oh zoloft is going to help with your anxiety but if youre bipolar your symptoms might get worse" & my anxiety was too bad to stay and try to find another medication i just went with it so i guess we are playing russian roulette with medication now ,1
it was horrid i hate it and will never use it again,1
horrible even when i tapered off i had itching all over my body and had to take benedryl for like a month and a half this can happen because seroquel has antihistimine in it and your body is used to having a certain amount running through it and when it dwindles you can itch terribly,1
oh god ive only been on it for a few months im scared to read these comments!,0
ive been on these meds (high dose) for 4 and a half years im trying to reduce it down for the 3rd time each time is horrid i know the good and bad of these meds and have had most of the bad side effects and bad withdrawl symtoms and im still scared to read this medications that work wonderfully for some people dont always work for others but if you dont try them out youll never know good luck and best wishes to anyone on serequel from the uk,0
im scared too i get a reaction like a rash light headed and dizzy so now i break it in half i just dont have much energy waiting to see the doctor,0
its horrible,0
i was tapering off in january and it was a fairly horrible experience- lots of body aches and pains and just felt like i had the flu all the time plus totally emotionally all over the place- eventually decided i was tapering too fast (50 mg a week) and when i slowed down it got a bit better i got to 200 mg and stopped and then later got a horrible mania so had to go back to 250 but refused to go back any higher,0
when i was tapering from it i got super restlesslike unable to sit down i cried a loti was very emotional it wasnt fun,1
going through tapering now for 3rd time feeling like you descibed beth oneill  im glad i read what you said as its making me feel less worried about it not being normal i couldnt remember what the tapering was like before as it was aweful but i was really unwell mentally too at the time thank you,0
im prescribed 2mg xanax 3 times daily helps my anxiety and im able to sleep im just really depressed due to the loss of my lil bro on the 4th of july he was only 34 and had wife and 2 kids service this saturday and im an emotional wreck,0
my dr had me try lexapro after i refused seroquel then cymbalta and finally wellbutrin the last one was awful for me felt horrible for 7-10 days dizzy and felt like the room was spinning i just stopped taking it i am done trying antidepressants!,0
i cant really function unless i have it the times that i cant have it i get shaky and nauseous and cannot sleep at all its not fun at all but seroquel makes me feel like a normal person,0
they moved me because my high levels of absence (not all for anxiety but other linked reasons such as my medication to help me sleep caused me to get migraines etc) made me unreliable and they moved me to a department which could absorb my absence levels better,1
i was hoping to stay anonymous but wanted to respond to this - my managers were fully aware that the area ive been moved to exacerbated my anxiety yet moved me there anyway they arent interested in any kind of compromise,0
wee mac gregor think i have anxiety been thinking it last few months do u agree xx,0
todays moment involved some anxiety depression & a lot too despite good sleep the night before ,1
sorry to hear everyone problems i can relate because my daughter my boyfriend and myself have depression and anxiety my boyfriend and my daughter has it a little more worse than me but sometimes i feel suicidelly and that is why im on antidepressants and also my boyfriend and now my daughter is on it too my thoughts and prayers are with everyone that is struggling and/or going thru it ,0
and actually mean it but i know im hard to love so i guess i shouldnt be upset about it,0
april nelson thankyou hun he has a lot of love from certain ppl but he is confused about whats going on but he is slowly accepting the diagnoses now we just miss him xxxx,0
and to actually truly deeply mean it but i think this day n age people confuse love with sex or what they can get out of someone,0
i like to believe that there are still more people who mean it then are confused! ~dani,0
not always some people do have that and their kids as well i have depression and anxiety plus my boyfriend and my daughter not all people are fake think before you speak please!!!!!,0
yeah get your stuff and leave be with your family not someone whos going to stress you out dont live your life for him live it for yourself,0
because of my condition i drove for 5 years i hated it i understand your struggle it was a job and i made decent money at it im glad im not driving any more i hope you can get out and do your own thing keep the faith,0
research n see if maybe in the next few stops on your route n see if u can get a bed at one of the womens shelters from there u can get resources to either get u home or get you in a place of your own what a horrible experience and i am so sorry youre going thru this stand strong and remember even when its uncomfortable anything is better than being basically held prisoner :( you can do bad all by yourself,0
the struggle is real,0
yes all true but if i dont face all of my fears head on i become a prisoner in my own home it has taken hard work and i am not quite where i want to be but i am living a better life then i did even a year ago never give up! <3,0
ive got it bad it overwhelms me wont wish it on anyone,0
not to dismiss people with serious social anxiety but some people are just wired differently (like add shyness stage fright etc) its what this society defines as normal ill get off my high horse now,0
i guess lining up with everybody at starbucks every day doesnt count? selective social anxiety!,1
nervous about this mornings drive,0
didnt realize that i had social anxiety,1
trying to support someone who experiences this is challenging and very sad for the person i know they want to be able to do these things but become overwhelmed by fear and anxiety as above wish i had a magic wand right now,0
people dont even begin to understand unless they live with the struggle,0
the struggle is real as much for your loved ones as for yourself,0
its a struggle at times,0
yes it is a strugglebut everyday i make and push myselfim not going to let this define me ,0
thats an ssri isnt it? you might have high levels of serotonin (maybe dopamine as well?) already some people with certain gene mutations react badly to ssri for that reason if its really bad low doses of no flush niacin can calm the anxiety from it temporarily def tell the doc!,1
ok so i have major depressive disorder was on cymbalta for a few years when i recently realized i was sleeping til 4-5 pm and really no interest in anything checked into heritage eastside behavioral hospital so i could see my psyc doc ( most psychiatrists dont take medicare as an outpatient) he switched me to effexor which seemed to work better but it is a serotonin norephrine reuptake inhibitor from what i have researched its the norephrine that provides a boost in energy it already seems to have leveled off in effectiveness at 75 mg i need more energy still since im dealing with a pc physician now any thoughts on suggestions i will bring up to her ie upping dosage etc? everyone of you out there experiencing these problems stay strong this coming from a former ngc cadet!,1
so i have bipolar 1 and a few other diagnoses like many people depression occurs more often than mania there is new research (just google stimulant use with depression or bipolar) that shows stimulant medications may help stimulants do not fix the depression but do provide some energy that helps kick start behaviors that help deal with depression i can only take it for 2-3 days because of the mania that can occur however it is not unheard of to use stimulants this way also a doctor is always the best place to start i wish any medications worked for me it takes me lots hard work to deal with my past to change my behavior and willingness to sit through the misery if someone can get help through medication please accept the help dont sit in misery you dont deserve,1
jeanette i have to disagree with you i am on a medication called vyvanse it is similar to adderall but it slowly goes up levels off and peaks down it helps me clarify my thoughts because i have bipolar and also anxiety disorder as well as adult add it does give me a little bit more energy to be able to proceed with my day so that is not 100% true,1
everyday i am taking buspironeattivanviibridgabapentinrisperidone and trazodonei am suffering from extreme anxiety and fear of the unknown,1
i am thinking one second ahead and it works sometimes the bloody thing is i cant predict when it comes and the thought of it coming scares the shit out of me but some how i am still here after 3 times i am not going to say be strong because it doesnt work but i suppose being and finding yourself in a environment where you are protected could be a help so called depression or what ever fucking sucks i am 5 days in good for me but i know i am due soon best of luck ,0
oh hunny i dont self harm but im teetering between homicide or suicide and i dont completely understand what is the pain killer but darlin i understand the search for something to take away the suffering and it in my case never stops even when i do my thing to numb or subdue the hurt for awhile but its there justso i will pray god to take that away from you and give you strength to stop i am afraid one day im gonna go to far and i actually pray for him to take me home i would say try getting angry (yep thats right) get mad at the evil spirit that is doing this to you thru you when you feel it coming let it out of your mouth your feelings and speak to that bad thing and tell it how pissed off you are and how you are a beautiful child of god and your body belongs to him and say this "i rebuke you you weak and defeated enemy you have no power here the holy blood of jesus christ gives me authority to cast you unholy spirit into the void "i say speak becauseeverything in this world was created with a word and the power of life and death there dwell the tongue is the most powerful thing god loves you and god bless you,0
need to be honest and ask for help as that is the way to recovery believe me i know whats like to be in the dark and confused and in constant pain please be honest with your providers there is a light at the end of the tunnel,1
i learned that sometimes the worse places make the best jumping points it drives us to do better and be better being alone will not make your feelings and self harm disappear proper treatment will you need to use this scary places as something to drive you as you are clearly strong as fuck,0
reallydont yellthats a stresser ,0
ptsd i have it and i constantly am in the chaos of it along with (bipolar personality disorder severe manic depression night terrors that wont let me sleep i dont have my meds (i dont have the money for them) im either homicidal suicidal or fits of crying or in a state of paralyzing fear (home invasion molestation beat to the point of death rape and i just had pacemaker put in my mom mocks me she says things to purposely cause me pain and she pushes until i am ready to do bad thingsi am alone no friends im shunned at family gathering not welcomedso i am constantly talking to god just like hes in the room and i hold nothing backi read his word and it will bring me peace and the feeling that he is with me and then mostly i sit alone with my dogs and the affection from them makes my heart feel betterbut i have realized that the further you are away from people who will make you flip your shit the more control and peace you will have they are poison to us they will light the fire or they will end up making you worse separate and disassociate from all negative and miserable people our sickness or what ever you want (satan) gets stronger when you are surrounded by them the difference between us and them is they are full of hatred and jealousy and they need to make us lower than them so they can feel powerful justified its like they want to be the victim get away from them soon and talk to god pray and read your bible! ??everyday,0
i usually get a manic episode in the end of march beginning of april and then again in august and yes my sex drive goes in over drive i wont lie at first i kind of enjoy the mania after depression the first day or so at least maybe but as others have said its important to get back on a stabilizer to get it back under control a few days without sleep flu like symptoms we start forgetting what we are doing and not evening knowing what is happening around us i am actually schizoaffective disorder bipolar type as well as ptsd with anxiety i know sometimes i feel i can go without meds or i just hate the side effects my fiance as much as i love him can be so unsupportive when it comes to my mental health but this is about you and your well being you come first,0
im bipolar type 2 with ptsd and anxiety i also am seasonally affected its common i take a small dose of antidepressant from oct-feb annually because the depression is so bad in those seasons and some years i need a small additional mood stabilizer or antipsychotic in spring or summer for the hypomania sleeplessness racing thoughts anger overspending being a total busy beebut the med changes keep the more severe reactions like suicidal thoughts at bay im sorry about your partner thats truly not healthy and not good for your well being you need love and support,1
nope getting mania in the summer is common- increased sex drive is also common and being angry at the drop of a hat is also common- you have just given textbook symptoms of mania in bipolar disease though it will be hard to do you need to get back on your meds- you need at least a mood stabilizer to get the mania under control stopping and starting the meds does nothing to make the disease better and will give you more heartbreak over your life yes the meds are awful and have awful side effects- you need to work with your doctor to find the best ones for you- just stopping without discussing the side effect that is driving you crazy does you no good and does not let the doctor help you figure out how to deal with it an example- i am newly on buspar for anxiety- it was causing double vision every day for about 5 hours- i really hated that- instead of stopping i talked with the doctor and he made the suggestion to stop the morning dose and just take a bigger dose at bedtime-tada no double vision in the daytime and i could care less if i have it while i am asleep i have had bipolar 1 for 45 plus years or so and diagnosed about age 24 (i am 60) trust me the range of medication options now is so so much better than in the 80s- do yourself a favor and start seeing a therapist a couple of times a month to deal with the emotional fallout of you life and being bipolar and get back on the meds- they are the key i wish you well in the journey we call life,1
i find it hard dealing with repressed childhood abuse and trauma i havent been diagnosed with bipolar - i have ptsd anxiety and depression you can pull through my darling think about all the things you havent yet achieved think about all the experiences you are yet to gain meditation and conscious breathing help me chill - as well as a spliff when i have money your bf is a c"#nt for saying that!!!!,1
my ex tried worked well but kept relapsinghelped with the anxiety and tremors,1
zoloft is a good script your going to have anxiety but the zoloft will help with that ask your psych doctor cause it may cause depression,1
i would exhaust all medication options first i had extra it didnt work and the memory loss is awful i now cant drive long distance as i cant remember directions or follow them i get confused thanks to extra try every other option first,1
sorry my comment included a few errors it only helped alleviate my symptoms for approximately one month not week i would not recommend it there is a newer similar therapy that is supposedly similar it is tmcs which stands for trans magnetic cranial stimulation im unsure regarding its availability and whether or not insurance covers it,0
i had 9 ect treatments several years ago i was in a very deep depression for over 2 years that no other treatment or meds would help it helped me a lot if i ever had to i would go through it again you definitely need good support going through it as it is hard on your body and your memory but it is well worth the work the first treatment is a little scary as you dont know exactly what to expect,1
i had 12 ect in 2012 and it worked but the side effects and memory loss is ridiculous i regret every treatment but my family directed the foctors to do it i had no choice my short term loss and long term loss are both screwed its horrible i cant remember my kids growing up i cant remember birthdays and little things that make meme i wouldnt do it if i were you i would try all medications before ect,0
hi i had 12 ect treatments 6 years ago for severe depression that was resistant to all other treatment and medication it was very beneficial for me although i now have huge chunks of my life that i cannot remember which is upsetting i would rather have that than try and fight the depression everyday if you have the support you will need i would say have the ect all the best,1
i find this to be false type 1 diabetes bipolar ptsd severe depression anxiety problems they are all treated as something that was my fault i didnt ask for any of it every day people tell me just to suck it up im told at least once a week that i shouldnt have eaten so much candy as a kid blah blah blah i was probably one of the smallest kids in my school was always active and outside playing running riding my bike and yet here we are being blamed for some shit i had no control over fuck you world fuck you!!,0
caitlin summars i dont think i was being biased i was being very understanding to both sides in your first comment you definitely were being one sided considering you yourself struggle with mental illness i cant understand your lack of empathy you stated in your first comment a diabetic illness can take a life unlike a chemical imbalance thats all you said no explanation & i completely disagreed with that & no one should prefer to be labeled crazy ive had family members die of cancer & theyve definitely had more sympathy through their struggle than a person with a mental affliction love & understanding to all i will say no more,0
cherie i do not underestimate mental illness at all both my son and i have adhdi also have anxiety and depression most days i am suicidalthough i would not actually take my lifei think about it constantly i battle every day to get upto interact with othersand i have struggled all of my life to hold down a job to support my family i have also watched diabetes cause thoughts of suicide in my younger sister she tried to take her own life through her disease its all awfulit all hurts and its all a struggle my point was if we went three-five days without psychiatric meds there is no guarantee we would be deadbut if a diabetic went that long they most certainly would be stigmas attached to diabetes also cause feelings of guilt isolation maybe because your experience is one sided its a bit biased towards mental illness i have and do deal with both daily,0
depression and other mental conditions can cause suicide the stigma associated with mental illness cause more suffering guilt isolation and sometimes drive people to take their own life i agree one disease should not be compared to the other & i feel for you and your son but do not underestimate the pain of having a mental disorder in my experience the stigma is greater,1
im a diabetic and have depression and anxietydidnt want either,1
yes play solitaire it takes your mind off you & is the best for me to relieve anxiety,1
yes i think about death all the time especially my family after my mother expired i develop major depression and anxiety i feel as though if something bad happen to my family it will take me off the edge ill be back at the beginning just dont want that to happen,0
i think the fear and anxiety you feel when thinking about death is its not that your scared of dying but leaving your family and the ones you love most behind thats what i tell myself anyway and it kind of helps a little maybe try keeping yourself busy find a hobby or something and do that when you feel a anxiety attack coming it should help x,0
overthinking is our worst enemy i apply to everything leading to anxiety leading to insanity,1
i used to have severe panic attacks about my mother dying before i was put on meds i wrote down a list of things i wanted to imagine instead: what would my life be like if i had the power to shapeshift? what would i do if i met the avengers and loki? what situation would cause me to meet these people? same as above but with a celebrity i liked if i was a villain what would i be after? what if i had control of fire and ice? imagine owning a team of six sports dogs what breeds and what sports would i like?,0
its a catch 22 sometimes youre so fetup you want to end it all then you are obsessed with the thought of dying this can swirl for ever in my head,0
i understand what you mean i go through stages that i dont want to be here anymore and be pain free sometimes i dont want to die i just dont want too exist sometimes i want to die then i have times where i think about dying and once youre dead thats it youre gone forever and my stomach turns and i freak out so much!! its a horrible feeling but i just cant help when it happens and stop thinking about it x,0
i know this doesnt solve anything but try finding a book series or tv show that you can really get into it helps both my husband and i to be distracted by something when were feeling anxious/scared/depressed you may even be able to train your brain to relax just by having the show on in the background again i know its not a fix but sometimes we need a temporary solution while we wait for the bigger fixes (like meds and counseling and the like) to start working their magic,1
it could be a medicine or combination of meds that triggering the thoughts i started taking trintellix and now im getting anxiety attacks plus other unpleasant side-effects  my last anxiety attack i forced myself to mentally walk through a place that brings me happiness a place with many happy memories attached to it i had to force myself to remember those happy memories but the attack subsided after about 15 minutes i was still very agitated though and i didnt sleep well for a couple days but even with all that it was better than the anxiety attack,1
well i had a medication that triggered night terrors make sure first that its not link to some of your medications otherwise i would have to get up turn on the lights take a bath do something to keep myself from going down the rabbit hole yeah i guess i use distraction techniques to derail my brain,1
sounds like you afraid of death or dying i was like that big time but had to redirect my thoughts its hard keep my mind busy something u like to do i am on lexamil was tough at first but i have to learn to cope,0
its not that im thinking of killing myself when i have these thoughts its that i get scared thinking about how im going to die and what death is like,0
me too and not only recently most of my life suddenly i start thinking about death and i give myself a panic attack which makes me feel like im dying right now its awful,0
dont be afraid you will meet the king when you pass,0
i turn to gratitudegrateful for my job parents brother house friends kidsreally comes into perspective when i see a homeless person with daily life strugglesbrings me brief relief from depressive thoughts,0
death is our only transport to meet the creator no one is immune to it being thankful and having gratitude lessens the anxiety about it you can be thankful even for the smallest things like commenting hereothers are blind some are fingerless some dont have phones etc in everything we need to be thankful appreciation goes a long way even if our family members sometimes think we are acting out but love covers a multitude of sins i really love your comment,0
thoughts of death are a common theme with depressionevery day the thought of my own demise crosses my mindthey say live your life like its your last day but in reality the thought of dying scares the shit out of most people,0
just dont think about it it happens to me too when i think on it and it used to be worse back after my first anxiety attack where i wouldnt even step foot outside but now ive realized that its apart of life and there isnt anything anyone can do about it so i dont bother thinking about it i think about how to make my time here worth it,0
lol the thing is im not thats how i cope with my anxiety if something is causing me anxiety ive trained myself to not even bother thinking about it because the moment i do? anxiety creeps back in everyone has different coping methods,1
i have same problem i want to die but cant when upset it feels like nothing left,0
withdrawals are a bitch 1 to 2 weeks of misery i just went off prozac and zyprexa but i did it at home cause i couldnt function psychiatrists always want to drug us i am on mild xanax and non habit forming hydroxizine ( visteral) andyes i have extremes highs and lows but id rather have that than the side effects of all that other shit it took about 3 weeks to detox plus i detoxed from cigarettes too tough but doable,0
i had similar withdrawals after stopping wellbutrin didnt dose down and had problems for about 7-10 days doubt that helps because all meds are different but i wish you well,1
i feel like my life is being robbed by bi-polar i scares me and i dont iknow how to stop it,0
true but it also gives you a chance to recreate yourself in a brand spanking new way a way that gives you a chance to be the person you could never be with out living through it it gives you the opportunity to map out your life as you want it to be had stuff but we are all so worth the work and struggle to beat this it is forever my friend but i chose how to live,0
i had the mental capacity to become something extraordinary maybe a surgeon a fighter pilot the sky was the limit then depression came along and destroyed memy intelligence went to wastemy life is going down the drain in a clockwise downward spirali fear n have no hope for the future my life is technically half over n ive achieved very littlei exsist im not living to my full potential i may as well b an enatimate object,0
anxiety yes i havehell it feels,1
depression n anxiety go hand in hand make it hard to function efficiently,1
u cant stop the stigma it will always remain because people hate n fear what they dont understandits been there since the dawn of time,0
still battling doctorstherapistspsychiatristsmedsnever ending it seems and my 8 yr old picked up slight anxiety from me and i feel horriblenow hes in counseling too helping him now so he doesnt turn out like me ,1
dont give us a placebo give us a fucking cureive tried so many medications nothing relieve s the pressure in my head,1
watch your breathing- during a panic attack you will breathe more rapidly and shallowly taking deeper breaths more slowly can help,1
i would try to wait to take the xanax until the morning or until a trigger is beginning its onset is usually 15-20minutes and is used in panic attacks more so as they have a shorter duration (4-6hrs) then many of the other benzos (12+hrs),1
anxiety meds! may slso be adhd,1
mine get bad sometimes music will pull me out or being busy with a focused activity that i enjoy like baking or coloring i use the calm app and do a meditation if theyre racing and im anxious or trying to sleep sometimes i have to get my meds bumped up they just wont stop until i do it has lasted weeks before good luck,1
find a physical activity my mind runs away on me all the time its hard but in the last year ive taken up running and i now run a lot if my mind can run me to panic my legs can run my to calm or physical exhaustion,1
mindfulness will change your life focusing back to the present moment does wonders mindfulness is a hard skill to learn so try not to get upset at yourself if you lose focus keep practicing and have it become a part of your lifestyle,0
look up mindfulness on the internet you can even get apps for your phone it helps you focus on the here and now and the anxiety drifts away it has been a godsend,1
i would stick it through the appointment next week- see if he is willing to go back on some sort of mood stabilizer- you might have to set up an agreement about supervised meds (he leaves them so you can see that he is taking them) without the meds this is only going to get worse so then you have a right to protect yourself- a trial separation might jolt him a bit into making the changes he needs you mentioned sleep apnea- interrupted sleep is a huge issue for bipolar- does he have some sort of machine or oral device to stop the apnea???? i know the affair is hard- know it is probably the bipolar talking but not sure how much that helps i have been bipolar 1 for 45 years- just had an huge long deep mania- at some point i listed our house for sale!!! now that they decided i can indeed have the only mood stabilizer that works for me (tegretol) and i am back to a therapeutic level i realize how horrible i was to my husband and i apologize several times a day- i made very concrete plans to leave him during the three months and was in general a bitch to live with now that the docs have quit doing experiments with me i love him so so much for being able to stand it all all i can say for me is the medications are key- the side effects are horrible and piss me off every time i look in a mirror and see how fat i am and every time i am thirsty but can have no liquids (they took me off tegretol due to a low sodium level- no other mood stabilizer worked and for a year i just went crazy- now they have decided i can have the tegretol but have to limit fluids and eat/drink a ton of sodium) bipolar is a serious disease and just going without the meds for a prolonged period is really really hard it is not something you can think yourself out of will be happy to chat with your husband if you think he would talk to me/and that it would help,1
this is a tough situation but not uncommon i was diagnosed with bp ii more than 25 years ago and still struggle with taking meds most if not all of the meds used have side effects and some are worse than the bipolar itself the only thing you can control in this situation is you but you can continue to encourage him to take the meds there are many meds available and everyone responds differently to them he can tell his psych he wants to try something different because he cant tolerate the side effects i have also found that supplements magnesium and vitamin d help me tremendously you may want to suggest something like that as well keep in mind that you cant force someone to do something and threatening typically doesnt help focus on you and taking care of yourself and let the rest work itself out,1
the struggle with meds is pretty common on/off etc i dont make very good decisions when im manic what hes saying/doing might be symptoms rather than reality im not sure of course i hope things get better ,0
i have bpd bipolar 2 ptsd adhd depression anxiety and ocdive been on effexor 1875mg lamictal 400mg intuniv 4mg for 3 years now (since i was 17) its been the most helpful combination of meds theyve ever tried and ive tried well over 100 meds since i was diagnosed at 10 years old,1
often times these illnesses go hand in hand so its not uncommon to have multiple diagnoses since there are no tests diagnoses are made based on behavior over a period of time i have bp ii and have been on more meds than i can count over the years i also have thyroid problems but it has nothing to do with the meds it seems to be more related to the bp itself if youre having problems with weight gain tell your doctor to try a different med there are many available that was dont cause weight gain ive learned over the years that you have to be your own advocate do your research research the different meds available nutrition supplements etc and dont hesitate to make suggestions to your doctor if you cant tolerate certain side effects speak up if your doctor doesnt listen to you find a new doctor,1
i take cymbalta right now 90mg and abilify 5mg all the other antidepressants either didnt work or made me sickim major deppressiongeneral anxietybi polar and fibromyalgia so far thats what i have,1
it caused me to have panic attacks and all i wanted was some sleep!,1
wellbutrin xl is an amazing medication i tell doctors that it helped me with my patience and toned down my anger issues im also on lamictal and without it im short fused and irritable so in combination they seem to work pretty decent i hope you find the right combination for you! also started latuda for 4 weeks and it was great my mind didnt feel bogged down and heavy it was like a refresher and cleaned the negativity from my brain,1
hey chad im in recovery myself im aware theres different addictions i know about the struggles of faceing our demons that kept me using i fight em errr day i have a good relationship wit my higher power ill support anyone in recovery n some in active addiction i talk wit em n try to encourage them to get help,0
addicts brains arent the same as a non addict i never said addiction wasnt real either simply that it is the fault of the addict and the addict only back to the brain an addicts brain deteriorates over time but only by choice hate to break it to you if you dont touch the shit in the first place you wont have to worry about killing your brain my 44 year old mother is an addict and i hate her now because she chose meth over my sisters she acts like a 15 year old by choice because she put the pipe to her lips in the first place,0
i hate effexor! it turned me into an angry and irritable b__tch,0
yes and its horrible,0
i was a in that place for a lot of years 20+ to be honest but ive pressed the reset button in my head and hate has become peace and acceptance and most of all iove who i am today if i can say anything its this "dont be afraid of change do it dont think it and you will find your way" lucky,0
omg i struggle with this daily it so hard,0
it will take awhile for me been depressed and anxiety-filled for about 25 years now im trying to deal with the death of my 34 year old younger brother had a wife and 2 kids so sad!!,1
i can relate to you with the weight gain and meds im currently reducing mine i understand if no one else does that putting weight on effects your mental state aswel and diets do exist and so does exercise but until ppl realise that some meds make it so no matter what you do it doesnt work i also understand about living is harder i have suffered something similar and for that i saw a councillor and worked through it it doesnt happen overnight but you can get through it with determination that its not going to takeover your life mindfulness if you do it properly does work for trauma i feel your pain and know how hard life can be but you can work through it and succeed in your life your 19 and have been through hell but take control and you win not them i know you can do it just take one day at a time and you will be able to have a life it never goes away but you can deal with it the things you have been through do not define you as a person its going to be hard and your going to have to deal with feelings that are overwhelming but believe me i can talk about it without feeling anything now because i have taken control and so can you i hope this has helped take care and remember one day at a time xx,0
the person who got killed may wish they were alive to tell the tale like you they never got the option it must be hard to live with all this but consider others who will not even share here for fear sometimes we have to acknowledge life is tough and move on your chance is university to move on and put a line under the past you can either let who did this to you ruin your life or make them aware you survived and can do more you can and will achieve and do not use anything as a crutch hold that head up you can and you will do it the oprion is stay in this state which is no good and well you have tried it to see no one realy helps so fight and stay strong and move on if you do not make it sorry no one does it for you,0
i was given it once and i am well old now so do not judge everyone to need your way out in deep depression you may not be able to accept another to lean on there is many ways and yes people survive other have not arguments like your instigating cause stress so you are causing grief here unnecessary through your misinterpretation the main teenager maybe brighter and more able now enough,1
if i have an infection in my body antibiotics will in fact cure me of that infection resting will help me feel better faster but that isnt what will heal me people do help if it wasnt for my friends and family being there by my side and supporting me i wouldnt be able to make it through life yes i have to do the hard work myself but anything that helps me without hurting me is much needed in surviving a mental illness the things that dont help is just trying to "hold my head up" and "stay strong and move on" if it was that simple nobody would have anxiety or ptsd or depression or any other mental illness im not trying to give you a hard time but telling someone that is swiftly sinking into the pit of darkness that nobody can help them is fucking bullshit! nobody can do the work for me but they can help me from falling too far and thats an important thing to remember sometimes it really does take more than "strategic planning" and hoping for the best,0
excuse me but in saying not to use anything as a crutch and that no one helps and if she fails oh well are you advising this depressed traumatized girl begging for help not to seek professional treatment and medication and to just live with herself in a suicidal state? medication and therapy are not crutches any more than my blood pressure medicine or allergy medicine are no more than my friends insulin is by your reasoning it was a bad thing my brother went and got surgery and bars and pins put in his ankle when he broke it in 4 places he should have just lived with it in the state it was and if he was crippled for life oh well im sorry for what ever you went through in your life to make you devalue everyone else but please lets not turn this support page into a place we basically tell people to go ahead and kill themselves,0
hi sweetheart im sorry you are going through such trauma at a young age i hope you have received rape counseling and ptsd counseling and therapy it sounds like you are suffering terribly at your age i wouldnt want to gain weight either any age really but because you are so young your body is still changing so you might not have such a bad problem i dont know because the meds im on dont effect me like that im being treated for bipolar major depression and anxiety im also a recovering alcoholic and prescription drug abuser i know it seems impossible to even think you will get better but you will if you really want to but you have to do some of the work there are antidepressants that actually suppress the appetite prozac wellbutrin have that effect you might ask your doctor about those so remember we need more strong young people like you in the world go to university you will love it i bet they have counseling for everything youve been through and support groups good luck at school!,0
i was diagnosed with depression at 12 and it was later changed to bipolar depression when i was 13 i ended up having severe panic attacks from the age of 17 to 21 i was also raped my ex fiances cousin (we were rooming with him at the time) raped me and my ex didnt believe me i was kicked out in the middle of the night it was cold and raining my dad lived a 30 minute drive away im 25 now and married and am pregnant with our third child i still relive my rape everyday even though it happened 5 years ago and my rapist stalked me for a very long time after that but trust me life moves on and gets better if you need to talk i am here,1
just remember things get better it takes time dont put too much pressure on urself try exercise if u feel up to it healthy eating think bout ur new course which will keep you busy i know it must be hard most of us been in v bad situations but it will pass try praying to god x,0
hi im melinda i have depression anxiety im 39 years old i want you to take it one step at a time even if that means one minute at a time ok??!!! once you learn to work through that you can move on i love to crochetcolor paint puzzlesetc i love therapy and working on the things one coping skills is write down daily tasks and check them off i love to write stuff down then throw it away our tear it up write a list everyday of your blessings you woke up today god only gives his hardest work to his warriors who dont think they can handle it your bravestrong beautiful courageous intelligent you can do all things you want to do!!!! i believe in you!!!! your 19 i was on my second marriage and pregnant at 19,0
i am so sorry that you have been through so much at such a young age you can get through this you need a good doctor to work closely with you it may be that you will need to continue on medication and counselling even when you feel better because going off to college and studying will be stressful and you will need to be able to cope,1
i feel the world hates me and afraid of everyone but love everyone i dont fit in either but we arent supposed to fit in how do we help each other if we are all the same or think alike you are not alone ,0
i suffer from depression and anxiety and ptsd and i am married as well with a child and i am willing to talk to you and your husband yall are more than welcome to come hang with us my husband suffers from ptsd as well and im also anti social but like i said im willing to talk to yall,0
you are normal the depression and anxiety are not you are not the only one i have seen the depths of hell during depression,1
i suffer from both depression and anxiety i go to a menta l health center where i join in and socialize with people and go on outings where do u live i live in new york state,0
your afraid to talk to your doctor because you think he will tell you offi felt exactly tha same when i stopped all my meds suddenly then had to go back as i was so ill my doctor told me "well that was unwise bet you wont do it again " but did not raise his voice or tell me off so please go chicsending you hugs x x,0
ty i doubt a pill wil fix my thoughts at all dont see how as i was straight up before w them and told them specific phrases running threw my mindpills given never stopped these chemical imbalancei dont see it though maybe im wrongi seem to never find relieve and tried literally all options known even talkingto my dr ive known for years telling her that i self talk badly exact phrases to be exact n no thingim giving up tired if thiseven prayingno signs of happiness n relief im lost,0
this is normal with both 1 and 2 my dad got really bad at one point when he would think hes better and chopped my baby bed up into pieces while i was still in it i grow ul and have bipolar 1 and have a manic spending problem that left me bankrupt  you are not alone in this cycle if im off my meds for 72 hours i start freaking out and have panic attacks i would definitely see a new dr that you feel comfortable with and check your blood levels too bc these meds mess up your liver too,0
go to your doctor be honest and stay on your meds id be afraid to go off mine i already have the slight over spending problems every time you go off of them the harder to readjust do the right thing stay on your meds!,1
i can relate i am currently having the problem of restlessness and needing to move but i also dont feel like moving if you need to talk im here,0
this sounds like a mixed episode were you on a mood stabilizer before you stopped taking your medicine? if you were you may be having a rebound effect it may take some time for the drug to rebuild to an effective level in your body: most psych meds arent instant do talk to your doctor asap but dont panic! i am the queen of mixed episodes and i speak from experience mixed episodes are intensely uncomfortable but they always pass! you wont feel like this forever try to sit tight keep your hands busy and fight the urge to do anything reckless or self-destructive if you feel like jumping out of your skin valerian tea is soothing and may help a bit til you can get to the doc and in the future if your meds are working stay on them! lots of luck,1
the best way to avoid the big rollercoaster ups and downs is to stay on meds all the time especially a mood stabilizer its so hard i fight it too not wanting my diagnosis or to need meds but i know im better off stable you have to make that appointment and you need to go regularly it helps so much im glad you have a supportive husband mine has been amazing even when i spent us into a crazy amount of debt or baked bread and cookies like a maniac on a four day sleepless bender good luck and hugs,0
ive not used lithium just quetiapine but stopped that as i was piling on weight and now the aripirazole - is there any other causes for it that you know of? i struggle around my period anyway because ive got endometriosis but never thought about the thyroid thing thanks for the reply i appreciate it ❤️ x,0
werid are you on a mood stabilizer? been under extra pressure?,0
you need to look after yourself if hes not willing to see a psychiatrist or doctor you should risk your own mental well-being to help him hugs x,1
if hes up & down all the time it can make ur moods go like that i was married for 19 yrs & my ex husband had me & the kids walking on egg shells all the time plus my childhood my dad was vioent to my mother including drugs an alcohol both those times in my life left me with depression & severe anxiety being around toxic people can bring u down i hope things get better but if his not willing to get help u should think about leaving him my ex done same thing said same things about my friends since i left him iv been able to be myself happy for once ,0
i understand its hard i had to get away from my boyfriend because he was always yelling and punching things with his anger issues and all and it made my depression and anxiety much worse,0
i dont think shes saying that shes "catching" schizophrenia or bipolar but she can end up being depressed and anxious from dealing with his constant complicated paranoid changeable unmedicated mental states just for the record too you cant catch schizophrenia but his paranoia can eventually cause her to be paranoid as well if shes going to be his caregiver she may need to get therapy for herself she may need medication for herself she may need support from a caregivers support group she needs to seek assistance for herself she cant "help" him if she cant help herself after shes in a healthier state of mind and hes seeing her going to therapy he may consider giving it a chance again himself,1
its not a rational decision its a release from the pressure and anxiety and sometimes from the numbing depression its being able to feel something anything when you feel nothing its to validate anxiety and stress when there is no reason for it its an irrational grab for control over anything even pain its almost always regretted as soon as it starts but it rarely even can be stopped and it is almost never for "attention" i understand and you are not alone ,0
self harm is something we learn to do to cope with a "pain" or trauma that we either cant face or wont face ( sometimes we dont even know what it is weve blocked it) it can actually release endorphins ( the bodys own natural pain killer like morphine ) so even tho we feel a little pain from the cut we might actually feel good from the endorphins! so in a strange way we use it as a poor form of therapy it helps us avoid a larger "pain" and it makes us feel better the trick is to develop better coping techniques to help us feel better and to find someone safe that we can divulge ( or discover) what the real problems are and then get better!,0
no pressure tho i am  after all  a stranger to you,0
you need to see a psychiatrist asap get on some meds there is help and support out there my anxiety and depression was so bad i about gave up on life please see a psych dr i pray you will be well i finally gave in and sought help it was hard but i had to do it,1
i need this right now my fincee left me on friday to go back home  been together for 16 years  my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression is very high  i dont have a clue on what im doing half the time  i hate feeling so confused n worthless all the time  all i do all day is think about her and worry about her ,0
when im anxious its because i am bipolar when im depressed its because i am bipolar i have zero control over either,0
this isnt meant to demean anyone for me anxiety has been caused from trying to control things out of my control that is happening around me or that i think will happen and the depression is caused by my sadness that things have happened and i cant do anything to change it we all suffer differently ~ s~,1
actually isnt that a buddhist belief? now what you said is indeed true thinking about and worrying about the future can lead to anxiety just as living in the past can bring about depression the thing is we are extremists and anything or sometimes nothing can trigger these reactions,0
i dread the future no reason to and i live my past over and over,0
i also have bipolar depression and anxiety i think the best assistance you can provide yourself is to see another professional as you age your diagnosis can change as you as a person have changed regardless seek some help medication will help you level out emotionally and take stock in what needs to be done,1
hi i suffer bipolar aswell and have emotionally unstable personality disorder mine means that im impulsive and irrational its to do with how your child hood impacts on your way of growing up for instance my dad was a drinker and beat my mother my mother was cold and showed no emotion or love and other aspects of my life made it harder to let my emotions grow with becoming an adult you should asked your dr what kind of personality disorder you have and why she thinks that hope this has helped good luck with getting your answers x,0
i had 8 sessions over 3 weeks this past june my psychiatrist had me stop because my short term memory was non existent i am starting to get some back but did not help with my depression and made my anxiety through the roof,1
theres a new medication being infused at the hospital i work at ketamine therapy google it worth a shot if youre reluctant to shock therapy,1
its been suggested to me to try ect from my psychiatrist but i have been hesitant due to the potential loss of memory i am extremely resistant to most antidepressants/antipsychotics but for some people it has worked wonders!,0
or i get the you cant dwell in the past forever or ive been there when they dont have it i hate especially the snap out of it if you think thatll work you have no idea what i feel or go thru,0
normal people cant comprehend how a seemingly happy person is a threat to themselves the isolation caused by fear of misunderstanding is deadly,0
thats more like it i feel like sometimes this is a place to wallow in depression and anxiety an upbeat post is refreshing,1
well ive had two recorded heart attacks and twice last eek i literally dreamt i was dying and awoke with severe chest painsi live in hell isolatedmy family daughters hate mei sacrificed my goals for them never touched me and i was too tough one my eldest trying to protect her innocent soul and now i am dying alonethey refuse for 6 years to speak to me deny me meeting or hugging them again or meeting my grandchildrenso ive gone off my meds refuse to kill myself afraid of the legacybut seek to die soonwithout ever knowing love again but escaping the horrible searing pain of depressioni at am my end!,0
fighting anxiety,1
yeah anxiety is very hard to deal with i take 2mg xanax 3 times daily and still have anxiety,1
may i ask what meds youre taking ? i just startedtaking fluxotine 4 days ago and i feel sick suicidel and stressed out and dont really feel like being here in the world/:,0
i feel stressed out of my mind with this new medicine i just started 4 days ago/: i hate it!,0
its ok ive struggled with depression since i was a teenager just a lot worse now pray for my family please,0
oh i did have side effects uncontrolled twitches inability to swallow and i feel like something else but the benefit greatly outweighed i also have rhemetoid arthritis and it helped my pain,1
stay out of the casino and watch for other signs of risky compulsive behavior,0
i had really bad anxiety on abilify it also made me have really messed up nightmares,1
it works good for me but it had the side effect of weight gain i am currently off it under doctor supervision in order to help try and loose some of the weight since it is putting me at health risks,1
i gained weight on abilify and had to take it in the morning bc it kept me up at night but it also made my anxiety spike through the rough i am nlw taking valproic acidsee how that works out,1
i had terrible side effects couldnt sit still was constantly shaking and amped up it was awful got off immediately good luck ,0
take in the am it kept me awake all night when taken at night i was put on it for night terrors due to ptsd and it has been 99% effective for me,1
well my doctor prescribed a almost three years ago the two previous years i had refused to be put on any so called moodstabilizer lithium lamotrigin/lamictal but fell into one of my worst periods of depression abilify (i was very hesitant!) an anti-psychotic drug wow!! after a few weeks i felt life again! after yet a while my energy shot through the roof i felt very content happytoo happy jitters - yes! after 3 months or so i was practically unable to be still my body and my mind couldnt take it anymore i lost weight very fast (which goes to show how very individual use of bp-drugs can manifest itself) well well that was that can still miss the good months on a dont dare to try it again but i know of comrades for whom a turned out great it surely can take a long time before one finds the best bp-drugs by the way im bp ii and was diagnozed as an "oldie" just 5 years ago - 55 now (excuse my somewhat clumsy english am swedish),0
i worry about the consequences of asking for help,1
well i was brought up that asking for help is a sign of weakness still struggle with this everyday,0
dont be afraid of how you feel and ask for help it takes a strong brave person to ask for help not a sign of weakness that is just ignorance stay strong ~ s~,1
try not to be afraid you know you need them because they work it will be well worth it when you have children something magical usually happens they consume so much of our time  and our thought process  especially when they are as young as your son revolves mainly on them i dont think you will forget to take care of your sons needs by any means it is clear he is your sunshine i too was anorexic before my first born after i had him it stabilized focus on the long term rewards if you can good luck to you! ,1
at 15 mg it gave me horrible thoughts once they put me on a low dose which was 5 mg the thoughts were bearable and nearly went away its not to bad it helps ease the depression and stuff everyone is different though,1
i was on 2mg and it changed my life for the better my doctor was worried about my weight gain so now im on 1mg (i split the pill in half) and i am still pretty good although i have worse anxiety since lowering the dose but my doctor also doesnt want to go back up she wants to start gradually tapering me off at some point when im feeling really stable in my life,0
2mg abilifly for me works great i take at night started at 10mg and lowered the dose until i and my doctor felt it wasnt making me like a very quite personwhich i am notnow for about 2years i have been at 2mg enjoying everyday right now life is pretty good my anxiety attacks have been few and far between personality is up i can get manic but i dont get depressed too bad anymore hope your meds help you out like me just work on the dosage with your drgood luck,1
hated it it actually made my anxiety so high i was afraid to leave my apartment will never go back on it,0
after months of finding the right dose i feel great! side affect i have is weight gain but i knew that would happen its still easy to lose the weight i just need to exercise more and eat right but mentally i have to have the right dose to feel better i cant remember my dose my mom is the one who controls my pills after a scare she had last year not related to abilify as i wasnt on it back then,0
gave me high blood pressure they told me i could have had a stroke walking,0
people make me feel guilty if i try any of those,0
same i think certain people in my life that once could not accept it are starting to i am the one who places the guilt on myself after i say i cant do something due to my anxiety ect not fun but in reality we have to take care of ourselves first,0
and me maybe we start to think thst we arr letting people make us feel guilty or that we make ouselvrs feel guilty?? eeasier said than done though!!!,0
i am on that exact same dose and i have severe anxiety attacks when i dont take them,1
have been on them now for almost two years was the same way which is why i started only thing i found that stopped me crying being anxious depressed and stopped the unwanted thoughts and feelings i still cant get through a day without them otherwise im a complete mess message me if you want :),0
i was on 250mg if i missed one pill i would lose my shit id be emotional snap very easily id eat a lot more that day id just be a total mess ive been needing to start them again but im to scared of going through the first week with them settling in now i have a son,0
same feeling i went up to 100 mg as i was juggling grad school family with a daughter having mental issues and a full time job as a ms teacher at a treatment facility i would cry from stress and anxiety just graduated so starting to feel a little more even but i can even think about not taking my meds in fear i would drown in a deep dark hole i am lucky my husband understands,0
i hope you will come into contact with many others who understand on here im sure people will confirm that many of the things you are thinking and feeling are common and normal in no way are you a failure i see ads as merely a crutch to help you along the path to recovery its definitely not a sign of failure i would say exactly the opposite you are aware enough that you just need some help its a sign of strength and honesty many people need some form of help in their lives medically mental illness is no different our minds are so complex sometimes they just dont work properly i do worry though if people begin to feel better this is sometimes when we might feel we no longer need the ads and come right off them it is sometimes the case when people with a mental health condition feel that they are doing really well and begin to run before they can walk and possibly take on too much coming off medication too fast or too soon might not necessarily work if some other challenge or difficult situation comes along in the longer term its not a sign of weakness if we need them it sounds as though you ve had a lot on your plate being strong for your son it can take so much out of a parent being there for those who rely on you try not to be too hard on yourself you ve done really well in acknowledging you need some help accepting the condition is a huge step towards recovery when some cant admit they are suffering small steps are key to an eventual goal lean on those who care for you and let people help you you can do this there is hope for us all xx best wishes x,0
stop beating urself up needing meds does not mean u r weak and id certainly nothing to be ashamed of,1
same here i am off meds as they are not helping me in anyway i am depressed from last 8 months i am 54 and jobless from last 2 years i left my job thinking my life will be stress free but the depression never goes and i continue to live with bipolar for eternity,1
failed? at what? you will never not have bipolar/depression it what you are struggling with so if you thought you could make it go away then yes you failed to accomplish the impossible its not about never feeling depression or mania and never struggling -- its about managing your inner state so you can live well so lets see -- you have several times come out if depression that can kill people stuck with your crisis team a long time when you needed them are raising a special needs child recognized what was happening did something about it and damn girl!! you are not failing at any single thing even a little! you are discouraged and maybe intimitated but you are not a failure,0
there is no shame in taking meds im on sertraline aka zoloft too just started it 2 weeks ago from being on effexor xr for years it seems to be working but it affects peeps differently your only a failure when u fail to try!,1
i know how you feelyou pick yourself up only to fall again its a struggle! bipolar is like that i try getting out in nature when im depressed or exercise but sometimes you be so tired i knowbut you have to push yourselfthink of yourself as a demanding coach for you to be better if you did it before you can do it again push through ,0
you must be brave and do what it necessary perhaps some medication is wise during this difficult time take note of the side effects of different medications things will get easier just takes a bit of time rest when u can look after ur sons dont stress too much if poss or take too much extra on do what u need to look after children and esp urself x,1
ive been on effoxor for over 20 years started at 75 im on 300mg along with othet anxiety medsif u want to talklet me no i just dont want to put all my business out therekeep your chin up,0
im not sure why you got off but i would see your doctor and start back on meds dont be afraid im sorry for what you are going through but now you need to think about yourself get up tomorrow shower take a walk then next week call your doctor so this doesnt go on much longer for you it sounds like you need the meds,1
thinking of you and praying for you! for you your family and your struggles xo with lots of love and support!,0
i suggest the book loving someone with bipolar disorder as a starting off point maybe go to counseling together your husband needs to understand your illness if he is to help you in turn it helps him and those three boys who didnt ask to be brought into this world or situation if they are too young to understand that mommy is sick theyre not too young to understand tension and strife between you and your husband the two of you together owe it to them to do what you can to make this situation right good luck,0
i would maybe travel so that you can get away from your home stress and relax maybe take a close family member or friend with you it will help clear your mind- plus it sounds like you deserve to treat yourself,1
propranolol / seraquel / lamictal it lowered my blood pressure,0
i take both propanolol and lamictal and my doc and i are leaning towards a bipolar 2 diagnosis the propanolol is essential for me for an internal tremble and keeps my blood pressure in mind the biggest side effect ive noticed is my physical stamina is effected less endurance out of breath more easily the lamictal for mood stabilization for had not shown any side effects and ive avoided the constant up and down moods since starting it a few weeks ago for me the combination is essential and effective with little side effects,1
im on 20-40mg propranolol twice a day for a minor hand tremor which my doctor and i believe is related to my ptsd and anxiety and so far its seemed to help with minimal side effects im also on 150mg effexor in the morning; 400mg epilim twice a day 75mg mirtazapine at night 10-30mg endep at night and 25-50mg seroquel at night,1
i have taken propranolol as a prn for anxiety and it worked well and it didnt cause any drowsiness,1
im on both one anxiety lamictl for bipolar one works great no side effects,1
propranolol is used for anxiety its actually a beta blocker but my doctor has me on it strictly for anxiety! it works for me,1
i currently take propanolol it is a beta blocker primarily used to treat high blood pressure i take it to lower my ♥ heart rate,1
propanolol/inderal is a beta blocker it has multiple uses and potentially can reduce anxiety by reducing blood pressure i take it as a migraine preventativei have been taking lamictal - in varying doses - for 13 years and it is a wonderful medication one of my children has bp as well and has been on it for years i have found the side effects to be minimal and the med to be highly effective,1
hi i take lamactil (as lamotrigine) 200 mg a day - in one dose instead of 100 night and morning as a mood stabiliser and 225 mg or 300 mg of efexor for depression and/or anxiety top up when not stable with 5 mg of olanzapine (as zyprexa) at night works in together well only downside is (in aust anyway) they lamictal isnt on the pbs (pharmaceutical benefits scheme) and the olanzapine leads usually to lots of weight gain,1
i used to be on lamictal but was taken off because of bad side effects but dont remember what and ive been on for quite some time propranolol which is actually a high blood pressure med i believe but not for anxiety or bipolar im on lithium for the bipolar which has given me permanent hand tremors and the propranolol is to combat them and im just so so lucky (sarcasm) that the lithium doesnt help the bipolar and the propranolol doesnt help the tremors sorry im of no help,1
propranolol is a beta blocker that is used for heart arrhythmia but is also use for anxiety it can also lower bp but very slightly,1
propranolol made my blood pressure too low and lamictal made my migraines worse and more frequent,0
im on lamictal propanolol and citalopram its a good combo for me propanolol takes away the physical symptoms of anxiety but not the thoughts,1
propanalol made my anxiety 10x worse and cause palpitations,1
propranolol works well with me im also on abilify and lamictal the only thing is that it does have a tendency on lowering your heart rate and blood pressure so i do look out for that with my pulse oximeter (excluding blood pressure),1
i take lamactil for my epilepsy bibi also suffer from manic depression/anxiety/ptsd and it works wonderfully with my other meds anx it has kept me seizure free for almost a year now,1
oh i became a psycho on keppra literally psychotic hearing voices suicidal homicidal seeing things paranoid angry all the time my boyfriend didnt even want to come home im only on topamax and wellbutrin now which has been awesome for me still having some seizures though; just not as often but the mood stabilization is spot on keppra didnt stop them wasnt a good dose,0
propanalol is a beta blocker you can be anxious yet your heart rate will not increase i found it effective with no side effects,1
i have to share this because we are talking about lithium my brother was on a diuretic for high blood pressure and the psychiatrist put him on lithium the two should have not been given together they together caused his kidneys to fail but before they did he swelled up in his abdomen legs scrotum and private parts so much with water that water was seeping from his skin and his skin was splitting open a nursing home did not know what was going on he got admitted to a hospital and they called in a kidney specialist and he knew exactly which diuretic he was to have with lithium on the right diuretic he lost forty pounds of fluid they were killing him with the wrong meds,0
i stopped lithium suddenly in pregnancy and was ok but it is v risky look out for signs of relapse and seek help urgently or re start meds,1
can you find another psychiatrist? i would suggest doing that i know its frustrating to be on meds but if youve found that they help you have every right to get that help can you contact your primary care doctor? (i apologize if others have already written the same thing i havent read all the comments yet) i wish you the best! dont be afraid to advocate for what you need as a human you have a right to have someone help you with your mental illness please take care and update us if you get a chance i care even though i dont know you,1
frankly it was irresponsible of your dr to stop your meds quickly like that he should have given you warning that he would be leaving his practice and arranged to fax your files to a new dr to continue your treatment the withdrawals can be super awful and agitate your condition immensely disassociation depression appetite fluxes suicidal thoughts/feelings nausea/vomiting and several other things just off the two drugs you mentioned that being said you need to see a new dr asap even if you have to see your primary care dr for a months refill while you find a new psychiatrist your medication should only be stopped under dr supervision for your benefit not because a dr is leaving playing yo-yo w your meds is dangerous if your primary care dr wont refill you can seek out an urgent care dr or an emergency room visit they can verify w the pharmacy of your prescriptions and lack of refills if you no longer have your pill bottles ps- i have found the effexor tablets have easier withdrawal symptoms than the capsules you just have to take them more often may be something you want to ask about and the above persons comment about smoking pot let me say that i am not encouraging you to do anything illegal but if it is legal in your state/area i would suggest using it while your meds get back into your system it easing your anxiety alone would be helpful but please dont use alcohol your liver and kidneys are going through enough w the meds,1
lithium withdrawal happens quickly with dissociative states messed up blood pressure dizziness disorientation lightheadedness confusion and after a few weeks possible organ failure effexor withdrawal takes 6-9 days to kick in and includes tremors hot flashes chills sweating fatigue inability to sleep nausea/vomiting dizziness severe headache and sudden severe depression (typically worse than your depression was to begin with) i was on lithium 1200mg for 8 years and experienced withdrawal once after 3 days when my mom was in the hospital for 3 days and only she had access to my meds (they were locked up) ive been on effexor for about 3 years now and experienced withdrawal once after 6 days when i was put in jail for 10 days (for missing community service) and they took 6 days to get my meds ordered both i was warned about when i was put on he meds in the first place of the importance of not missing them or letting myself run out because these withdrawal problems are real and intense and i experienced every single withdrawal symptom both times except with the lithium i wasnt off long enough for organ failure to set in,1
prudence lowe benjamin yeah while i was here a woman had a seizure due to them not getting her lamictal ordered in a timely matter due to that i got my lamictal sooner than any other because i made a big deal about the chick almost dying because of missing it and i was like two days behind her on my missed doses and started panicking,0
i came off effexor to fast and was sick for a week it was horrible,0
also why be reluctant to effexor? lithium is the most dangerous psychiatric drug out there and you are on that so why be reluctant to one as harmless as effexor?,1
prudence lowe benjamin its pretty safe as far as any research ive done on it for adults anywaysim 85 months pregnant and my obgyn told me the only real risk was cleft palate and a minuscule risk of a heart murmur but nothing to worry about i still didnt like the idea of the risks and weaned myself off asap but it was too late and my daughter has to be born at a special hospital because she has 6 severe heart defects and two organs are in the wrong place i did more research on my lamictal and effexor with pregnancy effects and sure enough effexor is a lot worse than they said it was can even cause part of the babys skull and brain to be completely missing or formed outside of the body its horrible for babies but so far still seems pretty safe for adults,0
brenda chapman also i never said lithium didnt work it is proven to be the most dangerous you disagree thats your problem and if you die of lithium toxicity due to your ignorance about the dangers of it thats on you lithium worked amazingly for managing my bipolar anger it works amazingly for most people but that doesnt mean its worth the risks all i stated was that it was the most dangerous and effexor is proven one of the least likely to give side effects you can disagree with those facts all you want but thats just ignorant,1
i hated effexor just finished weaning off completely last month i gained a lot of weight became more agitated manic and my cravings for alcohol came back i had terrible nightmares increased anxiety and had a dizzy feeling when taking it worst medication i have ever tried was up to 225mg thats just my experience,1
i respectfully disagree with ur comments regarding both lithium and effexor lithium is the first medication i have been on that is starting to help stabilize my mood since i was diagnosed 5 years ago effexor sucks! i was initially put on it for depression it made me so irritable and agitated that i turned into a raging bitch i almost lost my job as a result of it,1
heather morrissey i dont recommend lithium its terribly dangerous ruins your kidneys and is so terrifying to be on god forbid you are in the sun too long or dont drink enough and it can kill you it does terrible things and i found that lamictal helped just as much so i asked to be taken off lithium,1
ive never been on lithium yet i say that because that could be nextive been on probably over thirty different meds & combinations a lot have dissociative withdrawal symptoms it gets sooooo confusing after so long i got a heart condition with one that can be deadly but goes away when you stop itim getting tired i cant tell so i just go to my dr and report side affects to mental health sad someone would leave a client without a referralnot good,0
this is what scares me about getting back on meds a doctor wouldnt just tell a diabetic to stop taking their insulin i am constantly going back and forth over the struggle to find the right dosage or trying to trust a dr again its so frustrating,1
my god! any doctor worth their degree would gradually cut you back on your meds not tell you to stop completely having you stop such a high dosage of lithium so quickly is absolutely dangerous as well as just stopping the effexor it is within your best interest to either go to your local er to get back on your meds asap or get an appointment as quickly as possible you will crash and it wont be pretty im not trying to scare you but i had my dr do the same thing to me in 95 and i ended up in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt if i can help you or anyone else from ever going through what i didplease take this advice and the advice of everyone else who has posted a response good luck! :),1
1) stop sign realize that is your anxiety that is giving you the hit the fan feeling and out of body type thing is called disassociative (sp) disorder both are to be expected as well as nausea and appetite changes possibly dizzy and lightheaded 2) find another doctor fast if you have to go to a clinic like red rock or north care even dhs should have some resources for you to help speed things up 3) smoke some pot im sure im gonna come under fire for this but it does help with the agitation and anxiety not so much the depression but it doesnt sound like you have that at the moment please take care if you need to get to a hospital for a couple days please dont wait i hope this helps you and others have great ideas as well we are all here for you,1
chanel chartrand not to be argumentative as im sure lithium withdrawal plays a role in disassociation but it is not solely due to lithium withdrawal this is an issue i have dealt with since before beginning lithium and it was usually when my anxiety was at its peak i have definitely noticed it happens easier now of i forget my meds now that my body is accustomed to getting lithium and effexor (and other meds) on a regular basis lessening the anxiety does have the potential to help lessen dissociative spells this is just me speaking on my personal experience as we are all obviously very different and react differently to meds/withdrawal/situations smoking pot would help the anxiety and probably the nausea as well while the person gets their meds back into their system and gets leveled out also i totally agree about how quickly the lithium withdrawal can happen if your meds schedule gets off due to being sick or running out of meds it can mess you up in a heartbeat this poor person is probably hanging by a thread right now due to how the meds were stopped :(,1
the weed does help im not saying sit around all day and smoke but just to ease the anxiety,0
if you need to go for a 72 hour eval they can get you a new doctor horrible that you were left like that happened to me if you need to go to your primary care doctor that is who helped when my doc bailed then found new doc,1
where i live there is a 6 month to a year waiting list to even see if the psychiatrist is taking in patients with bipolar my gp is totally useless when it comes to thing like mental health but i guess i could go in to the emergency and wait 12+hrswhich just steams my anxiety thanks for all the wonderful comment and advise sure am getting sick of this almost mind game for patient who need treatment immediately:/,1
i believe it ive had so many shitty psychiatrists in the last twenty years in fact my last one who was really old okay told me on a wednesday that he was retiring; he was horrible anyway the most he ever saw me for was exactly eight minutes; on friday morning news there he was in orange being led into a courtroomget thisfor child pornography good doc huh ?,0
yes especially now i make myself get out of the house for a bit to keep from having panic attacks or worse,1
often i know i irritate my folk here most of the time,0
try to remember when making your appointment that you arent committing to taking anything just by making the appointment you will have time to talk with the prescribing doctor about some of your fears and feelings only after discussing these things will you need to decide if this is the right route for you most likely meds wont be the only recommendation some form of therapy group or individual will be helpful with modifying your thought processes about the best way to take care of you maybe your boyfriend can go with you to help with that conversation then if you decide to take medication please be patient it takes some time to figure out if its the right one (or combo) for you i will say that meds have saved my life in the past i still get cranky sometimes about having to take meds and i get cranky that i still have to work with therapists or groups for my particular illnesses (why cant it just be one or the other??) but these efforts far outweigh how lousy i feel when my illness is in charge of me i hope this helps you best of luck in your journey be well <3,1
i am rapid cycle bipolar 1 and have been diagnosed in 2008 yes it has been a rollercoaster but it is a manageable illness if that gives you hope i continue to struggle when i take my meds i resent it but i know that i need to in order to remain stable and live a balanced life you can either choose to be healthy or remain a victim to your moods which trust me is not fun and dangerous take that first step and find a doctor you are comfortable with and talk to a therapist about your feelings with this new diagnosis you will be fine and that is the great news good luck and feel free to message me with any questions or concerns,1
i was so scared to see my new pschy doc i cried when he walked into the room he was so nice & comforting he spent a lot of time answering all my questions i write down all my questions on a sheet & give it to him then he goes through them one by one now i love my monthly appointments & my husband always comes in with me good luck,0
dont be afraid of your diagnosis be happy you have gotten one and can now begin to understand your moods and how to manage them this is the beginning of something better for you!,0
i really struggled with the idea that id have to take meds for the rest of my life to be normal its 35 years since my diagnosis and i still do sometimes remember that you dont suddenly have bipolar this isnt something new its just that now you have a name for it the meds arent so much about normality after all everyone is a little strange instead think of it as allowing you to function so you can be the best version of you i could wander around without my glasses despite being very short sighted its possible but would make my life so much more difficult instead i wear my glasses and ill have to wear them for the rest of my life this isnt really any different,0
anxiety can cause us to put off making appointments i have found if i make a plan the day ahead and have the number ready it helps for me planning everything ahead eases my anxiety,1
i have bipolar and anxiety 17 years and as of past 8 months anxiety has been super bad trying to find a new dr appointments can cause you to stress or upset you but in the end the only way youre going to get better is with help from a dr appointments arent always fun but they usually end up being painless and youll realize you got worked up over nothing,1
i lost my fiancé to overdose last august he died in my arms i understand what youre feeling; that unending pain the thoughts that creep in when youre at your weakest the crippling anxiety of having to deal with anyone or anything i go to therapy sometimes 2x a week and sometimes once a month im on medication and that helped keep me from self harm and help stabilize my moods the best advice i can give is to think that even in your darkest hour youre loved one would want you to live live for them ive recently been able to smile instead of cry when i think of my fiancé i know you dont want to hear it but time takes time this is going to hurt for a very long time before it gets better some days youre going to want to call it quits in those times change your surroundings go for a walk a drive or even sir in your backyard i used to sit in a daze in my backyard staring at the stars to calm myself down keep taking your meds go see a therapist and most of all hang in there theres always a better tomorrow if we can just hang in there feel free to message me if you ever want to talk❤️,0
thank you for sharing about your struggles im sorry you lost someone so dear to you i was on epival 1000mg for a long time it helped stabilize my mood but i found it left me feeling depressed a lot i found that i needed an anti-depressant as well everyone is different and it can take a lot of time and trying diff medication combos its really hard to stay patient and hopeful while going thru it talk with your doctor- be open and honest about what youre dealing withabove all dont give up no matter what- you can treat this and find your groove all the best!,1
im married to a toxic person its so hard listening to complaints about my sleep or being "lazy" constantly bringing up a friendship i had that made me feel good but he hated calling me names timing me when i leave i am not allowed to go out with anyone its a horrible life to live,0
one thing i will say because no one else seems to have the ability to say it"what we see in others is sometimes how we view ourselves past or present they are mirror images of who we were at one time or who we feel we might start to become and if we do not allow ourselves to look for anything good in someone we will only see the bad how we allow others to affect us is on us and our own conscience most times what people say to us we may see as a slam against us and we feel guilty which is why we react to it as we do but if we look deep within ourselves we will maybe see a little truth to it and no one seems to be able to handle viewing themselves as the bad person it doesnt mean we should give up and lose ourselves deeper into darkness it simply means we should search further into ourselves and find a way to become a better person no one is perfect not one person we all have flaws but taking to heart what others say to us may either be who we really are or who they really are arguing with people or claiming you are more righteous than they are leaves hurt feelings and damaged egos you cant help fix a situation by yourself but you cant expect others to do all the work either no one should bow down to each other but it doesnt hurt to discuss feelings in a calm and loving manner either anger yelling and screaming gets us no where with each other,0
let me try this again u must come first itd easier said then done but ur sanity is more important if u dwell on this youll bring ur self down and i know u dont want that to happen take care and i wish u the best ive been there,0
est for you u need to b first u cant worry or change them,1
sometimes we need to just be left alone for a minute and thats ok and sometimes we can be misinterpreting good intentions and helpful words either way i think if you feel overwhelmed then its a good time to take a step back from everyone altimtly they are your family and they do love you i can write a book on family drama ive been told as much lol sometimes they dont kno how to love us in the ways we need it so like i said take yourtime off but dont cut them off completely my advice,0
meds are half of it a person must do the work to get well ive been suffering from mental illness for more than half my life now and i can tell you i was where shes at it will be uncomfortable but to get better you have to do what it takes i went to counswling and a counselor that could problem solve not just listen to me be a victim of the world i learned everything i could and am still learning about my mental illness i have learned how to cope some days are still hard but i want to be a productive member of society so i do what it takes yes im on meds and yes they help never give up! :),0
i have 8 kids five steps all severely traumatized by life with mom/stepdad i watched two slip into addiction it was very bad with one she just wouldnt get help we tried everything over and over again until they are ready to take their meds and go to their appointments and do the work? we cant carry them its heartbreaking but good ending now shes 3 years clean doing great in college on meds stable she had to want it just be there for her and push her in the right direction if shes ever a risk to herself do everything in your power thats what finally motivated my girl to move forward for herself if shes still a teen you can force her to take meds and do appointments but after that? its on them good luck,1
for me meds were a merry-go-round it can take a long time(years even) to find the right combo in my state wa mental health diagnosis is enough to get you on the states medicaid program (aka obamacare) and dshs i look at meds and mental illness like type 2 diabetes the pills initially help get it under control then you focus on a healthy diet and exercise as part of your management plan in addition to your regular check ups - you can eventually go off the diabetes meds if you get your condition under control for me that translated into good sleep hygiene (super important mood swing trigger) a reduction in inflammatory foods abstain from alcohol proper vitamin levels (checked via blood test by my doctor) known to be linked to depression and mental illness (deficiencies in vitamin d b vitamins etc) some sort of exercise like walking or recumbent bike (where you can zone out and practice positive self mantras "i am worth this effort" "i am not my illness and my illness doesnt define who i am") and intensive therapy/counseling 1x/wk which eventually became needed only 1x/mo learn how to handle stress and life events that can trigger an episode i went from rapid cycling to practically stable and medication free took me the better part of 4yrs i struggled all through my childhood (knew something was wrong with me since i was 12) until i hit 30 and decided to take control of my life because i couldnt keep going the way i had been living i struggled all through my 20s with a wrong diagnosis of depression and insomnia and improper meds things changed when i got the right diagnosis another thing to keep in mind bipolar and other mental health disorders usually have co-morbid disorders and components that may not appear until later in life or be hidden by the primary and initial diagnosis,1
take her phone away i know that sounds extreme but without it to distract her she will get bored and start doing things like looking for a job make a role if she is going to live with you that she has to take meds lastly dont enable her my parents did all 3 and though i was really upset at first it helped in the long run maybe consider yoga or meditation i can understand her position as i have bipolar and really struggled and still do sometimes to be adult ultimately its going to come down to her will if she wants better things in her life than you have to put in work or go the lazy way and put her on disability just dont cave and not do anything,0
well im in the fight formylife buti struggle w taking meds since i feel its notmagicandgoingtofixmeiwas notborn w those meds in my blood andbodyso i struggle w mans idea of medical medicine to "fix" meidontevenlike givingmychildren tylenol bc of thewayitmakes them seem sohighntiredit changes there naturally​ stateon the otherhand i take street drugs currently meth to cope w mypain and struggle so what​ do i know im uneducated and society would deem me an outcast or disposableso personally my advice islet hermake thechoiceits her brain and chemistry just be there when she needs u dont force love,0
carrie the motivation issue is something i still struggle with from time to time at 17 i just wanted to be left alone to do my own thing which wasnt healthy for me at all thank goodness my parents were proactive about pushing me to do things and that my doctor was amazing in helping me work through things it may not be what you want to do but some tough love may be in order here if your son can get a jump start to his motivation it may spur him onward with things he does have to have the want to get better and do what it takes though i would suggest that you talk to his doctor and maybe even a counselor to get some ideas on how to help your son they should be able to give you support along the way as well since youve probably got a difficult road ahead of you mental illness isnt very kind to begin with and adding teenage hormones to the mix makes it that much more difficult,0
seroquel is notorious for weight gain i had horrible side effects from effexor but it is highly individual gabapentin isnt that high i started at 600 or 800 and went up to 1200 day,0
neurotin is used for many issues from mood stabilizer to preventing seizures and restless legs not pain however,1
horrible experience,0
i had horrid side effects from sertraline as did my son i had severe hot flushes and hallucinations my son began self harming we both immediately stopped the sertraline in saying this i know many other people that take it with no issues,0
it took me 3 weeks to settle of course the first few weeks you go right down as in you become the worst you never thought possible after that i found it helped me manage my anxiety attacks better and with the help of a lot of therapy i managed to control when i had them a lot of the time i never relied on the pill as i need to put the work in to help myself also but it did help me when i was learning how to control myself,1
i find them great helped with my bipolar 2 and no more panic attacks  no side affects for me ,1
didnt do much for meall it did was make me really hungry at night time enough to disturb my sleep + gained a ton of weight from it & worsened my depression,1
ive been on it twice in my life both times for about a year but the side effects were horrid didnt ease up much even with time so i took myself of it this time and the withdrawal was horrid and ill never take it again and im sick of hearing drs say this drug doesnt have withdrawals because they were worse then any anti depressant ive ever been on and ive been on a lot of them,0
at times i live in co and have been recently trying different strains of pot for depression and anxiety,1
gave me panic attacks,0
i was in fluoxetine (prozac) for years and out of the blue had a reaction mood swingsself harm suicidal thoughtsanxietyshakes sweats i was told sertraline was not as harsh ive been on them four years the first week was hard as above i became depressed but now im even no ups or downs ive spent 2years training to be a counsellor passed level 2 and 3 counselling skills if i hadnt switched i dont know what would have happened,0
cant they change ur meds / stay away from stress and look after urself  things will get better and you will be able to do more,1
no doubt,0
i must be the only one that fears my bed anywhere is better then in that prison that offers nothing but an endless stream of painful thoughts,1
i take buspar for gad lithium for mania and latuda for depression this is the right combo for me i feel amazing finally after 18 years i found the correct combination i have bipolar 1 gad and social anxiety disorder,1
i have trmd with severe anxiety my dr had me on busporin for quite a while 10mg 3 times a day - it actually worked okay for a fair period i have to say in all the time that i took busporin when it was working - it was just fine for me anyone on here have any more information on fetzima? i posted a question about this before - and someone was kind enough to put their experience as a reply - was just wondering if anyone else had any input on it?,1
actually i really appreciate you asking valeda! basically i am prescribed a medication which if it works the effects only last a limited amount of time this time limit can be as short as a month or as long as 3 - but never usually more than that amount of duration i have been on so many different medications that my dr is basically running out of things to prescribe in my last few sessions he has suggested that i should consider electric convulsive therapy - which i wont do as ive done a fair amount of research and feel that the risk brain injury from this type of therapy is not something i am willing to risk for myself,1
buspar (or busperin) is a non-addictive alternative to more traditional meds like valium or klonopin ive been on it off and on for a couple of years its been very effective in treating my gad but it stops working if you take it very consecutively its not an antidepressant it was made specifically for people with anxiety disorders it shouldnt cause mania or exacerbate it in any way at most you will feel a little dizzy if this occurs then take a half of one instead of a whole one,1
great post i am currently weaning off remeron on to effexor and was scared  but im following all the dr said,0
yes!!! when ending one med you have to be weened off and not taking any at all is soo soo soo dangerous and scary i will be the first to admit that there is no miracle pill and its not just about taking the right meds you are your best advocate to getting better but we are sick and need the meds too,1
you make a very good point it has actually been concerning me for quite some time i usually recommend chatting to their dr different meds c work differently with different people and can cause different side effects i have bipolar i and anxiety and it took me 18 mths this time around to find the right combo but im doing well and working a full time job i also have chronic pain which effects my mental health but a tweek in my doses and im doing well,1
uhyeahso sprinkle it with adhd anxiety & ptsdand its like skittles in the braintaste the rainbow,1
whats a study? confusing,0
have my alarm clock set on my telephone to take my meds,1
i struggled for about 20 years with the idea of "having to take meds for the rest of my life" so id take them for a few months and once i felt "normal" i would wean myself off them so i could be "normal" every single time within 4 or 5 months id end up in the hospital for one self harm situation or another even after that i wouldnt take the meds and would end up in a long term rehab within 3 years as a result of trying to self medicate with a barrage of different substances buy into the hype of anti medication or jump on the band wagon of anti big time pharmaceuticals but ive been taking my prescribed medication daily as prescribed by my doctor and havent been hospitalized or taken street drugs / obsessive amount of alcohol since when i tried to be "normal" by avoiding my medication i ended up acting abnormal now that im staying on my medication i live the most normal life ive ever lived before just sayn,1
ginger right its a struggle but my experience has been that its a lot harder to fight the daily troubles outside of my control without the medication medication isnt a "cure all" but once i decided to stop listening to that internal demotivational tape that has always played repeatedly in my head about how weak i am that i to need medication or how society is right about how im foolish to think i need medication then i started to realize that these meds improve my quality of life and more important than that; it improves the quality of life for my wife and four children dont let the thoughts that have always tried to destroy you keep you from doing something that helps you live,1
austin: ive been working with my doctor and it took almost a year and a half of trying to figure out what works best with my chemical make up (because everybody is different and the same regiment that works for me might not work for you) we have found that a mood stabilizer daily and a stimulate when needed helps me to manage my daily life without falling into an emotional pit of despair while we were trying to figure out what works best for me we tried a medication that caused visual hallucinations but i contacted him and he imminently discontinued that medication and got me in the same week to make sure i was alright its important to note that although that was not a pleasant experience i didnt give up hope because i reminded myself that the goal was to get better and only rarely when trying to figure out the best way to do something is it ever gotten right on the first try even when i started taking the medication that im using today i had to deal with stomach discomfort (constipation / weight gain) but i counter acted those side effects by changing my diet and forcing myself to start exercising a funny thing about that is that i started taking a natural probiotic (extremely healthy and all natural) supplement to help with the constipation and for the first week i felt like i had to use the restroom all the time even when i didnt have any stool to dispose of one thing to keep in mind is the fact that youre going to feel different but thats the point some side effects can be a sign that youre on the wrong medication but other side effects can be manageable as long as youre willing to put in the work ive been working with my doctor and for the past five years ive been on a regiment that helps me and havent had to suffer any of the side effects that came with not taking the medications such as hospitalization / self harm / suicidal thoughts i hope that answered your question and sorry if it was a bit long winded but im working on a book at the moment so i get into writing and its difficult to stop,1
im looking at getting all medication regularly myself after going back and forth on it how many years straight have you been taking it christopher and have you had any major side effects that were a problem? that is one thing that i worry about,0
i got stephen johnson syndrome horrible,1
i was allergic not just a little allergic but the life threatening allergy they warn you about i got stephen johnsons syndrome so my exposure was very short,0
i havent had problems with it it does so much; helps with ocd is the main thing but also with anxiety and lots of others that i dont remember right now!,1
was taking a high dose & had night terrors & sweats for 6 months (worst 6 mths of my life!) & my psychiatrist said it wasnt lamical but against his opinion i decreased by 50mg & its fine,1
the rash is the main thing i got it but was also lowering off epilim while starting lamactil which shouldnt be mixed a while down the track im back on lamactil/lamotrogine and no rash just make sure they go very slow in raising doses it helps my mood ( im bp2) the irritability and swings but i also take zoloft for depressioni found for me it was one that didnt stack on the weight im now on 400mg 200 night and 200 morning,1
i got seroquel after that and it worked wonders should have got it first maybe it was scary ,1
word! in my case fatigue insomnia guilt the hardest to handle and judgementbut not others my own,0
my daughter started on fepakote at age 16 she did ok but when she started lithium things changed for the better even she recognized the change and gets upset if a dr wants to take her off lithium everyone and every md is different,1
the depakote is most likely to help it is a mood stabilizer which is the hallmark of treatment for initial treatment for bipolar fluoxetine is an antidepressant based on my knowledge and experience i believe that antidepressants should not typically be prescribed for bipolar because it puts you at a higher risk of developing mania,1
every one does different on the drugs but the main thing is dont be afraid of them keep a journal when you start your meds to keep track of the side effects it might take a month to start seeing positive results but dont stop taking them ive been on meds for 9 years and we finally have a combination that works best for me and yes get blood work done my doctor has me mine checked every 6 months for tegretol levels,1
depakotes a weight gainer but theres meds to counteract that but dont be alarmed unless ur already overweight alot,1
cant speak for the first two but the last; matrazipine quiets the mind and makes you sleepy and more relaxed has helped me sleep without anxiety (mostly),1
my weight gain was minimal to the point of non mentionable but the breast changes were awful led to a serious breast infection and cancer scare :( otherwise though it was a great fit drug wise,1
i have literally been on every single "mood stabilizer" on the market i gained weight with all of them some more than others and it is not just serotonin and appetite! they mess up your metabolism! so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they are right every med has a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lost weight but i agree weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! it is a huge thing and it affects your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self worth!! (and really self worth is a part of all the others) ps i gained a ton of weight on risperadal!,1
ive been on a low dose at times and so was my son in me it caused a small increase in appetite and a few pounds of weight gain not even five in him in hugely increased his appetite and they changed his meds but the benefit of having moods and anger - irritability controlled? worth it i do recommend getting your prolactin levels checked if youre on it any real length of time it can cause them to rise resulting in those side effects others discussed,1
id rather deal with irritability than gain more weight im already dealing with metabolic issues related to hashimotos that have caused weight gain gaining weight will not help my irritability or mood of that i can assure anyone who thinks weight gain is an insignificant side effect,1
this!  i have literally been on every single "mood stabilizer" on the market i gained weight with all of them some more than others and it is not just serotonin and appetite! they mess up your metabolism! so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they are right every med has a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lost weight but i agree weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! it is a huge thing and it affects your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self worth!! (and really self worth is a part of all the others),1
i dont know about weight gain but i was highly allergic slurred my speech and raised my mania and anxiety so high i had to go back to the hospital more than once because it took so long to get out of my system and made me so difficult to be around,1
docs have tried hard for so many years finally settled on anti anxiety and sedatives now im a zombie,0
i feel for all of you i have had separation anxiety depression and bipolar ii since i was very young of course face in the late 60s 70s and early 80s drs were just figuring out what depression was i have been on every medication that they have come up with i had a fairly good luck with lexapro i have major panic attacks often i now on 20mg of trintelex i do a lot of sleep hypnosis havent been able to work and for some reason i can get ss disability,1
i switched from sertraline to citalopram the transition was a low but i am beginning to feel a change i was on 150 mg of sertraline daily and still felt anxious,0
50 mg is usually starting dose def talk w dr go to psychiatrist not family dr also try to find dr who is updated on newest research on bipolar spectrum the latest diagnosis in new dsm5 is major depression w mixed episode which means mood swings basically important cuz lots of people get diagnosed w depression/anxiety for yrs b4 a dr sees that its really a mood disorder which medicstion is different that just an anti depressant usually a mood stabilizer is added and works wonders but if this is first time on meds u prob on way too low dose of zoloft,1
ya it happens i sometimes need to take sleeping pills or anxiety reliever bt now i ve been taking it continuously for a month and nobody knows about it,1
i totally know what you mean the guilt you have after snapping at someone is awful just know its not your fault i have recently been diagnosed with bipolar and i am on 200g of lamotragine citrolapram and valium used only as a back up med just in case i go up or down to control my mania and depression so far so good we are all not alone here in our battle x,1
i recently had a bad episode and had a date i thought i was ok with him but the day i was upset and crying and he said i lead him on so yes i do know how much it hurtshe told me he was councillor so felt safe with him so now im thinking i am a very judge of characterits mad how you feel afterwardsyou feel awful,0
absolutelydont stressit is a matter of the right meds mixed with a healthy diet and some pot maybe??? helps with anxiety,1
yvonne sands hello(: so far they make me feel crazy/: i use to take celexa but for some reason when i would take it in the morning around 5oclock at work it would ware off and it felt like my brain friend i was off pills for 3 years but now i have to take something im scared itll get worse for me/: hows life been for you without medicine ?,0
hi there ive been on them for depression there an ok tablet not on anything at the moment  it helps me to keep stress out of my life x,1
i think having bipolar you actually have to go through those ups and downs different meds therapy and sometimes even inpatient treatment its a struggle that will never disappear but what helps me the most is faith in god and positive thinking someone told me to find what makes me happy and pursue it im still strugglingeven gave up on god lost relationships isolated myself to the point of having social anxiety afraid of people i just put on a mask and fight the days ahead with positive thinkingsome days are good and some days are bad but i thank god i made it through spreading love and courage to you ,0
fluoxetine worked great for my depression but made my anxiety worse sending prayers and love,1
please talk honestly with your doc about your anxiety im on 20 mg of fluoxetine also and its the level i need but my friend i think you need a bit higher dose also please seek counseling talking to an objective professional is extremely helpful! there are professionals to help you seek help you are worth it!!!,1
are you seeing a dr on a regular basis? you need to open & honest with the dr & tell them how much you are struggling you could also ask about counselling services that might be available to you so you can work on some strategies to help you feel more in control blessings ,1
try wax my friend uses it and she has really bad anxiety and it really works for her just get a medical marijuana card and youre good,1
i was on 20mg fluox same as u then more shit happened they upped my dose to 40mg and also put me on 50mg seroquel (which is supposed to help sleep as well-- mine doesnt) so i got put on 10-20mg temazepam to make me sleep which doesnt always work and recently got put on 6-12mg valium bc even more shit has happened dont be afraid to go back to your doctor and say it isnt working completely or u feel like u need to change or something more also recomended to me and alot of ppl i know are on avanza (anti-dep that makes u sleep),1
yes i do that alot wake up heart beating out my chest n awful sweats n panic attack!!,0
hugs my daughter has sleep anxiety it took years to get her to sleep normally its still an issue severe ptsd in her case i feel for you its heartbreaking when you cant find peace even in sleep i hope you find a med combo that works and that you feel better throughout the day be well,1
you might try klonopin instead of valium it last longer might help you make it through the night and i have so much anxiety and then youll feel a little more refreshed,1
latuda made me question life and gave me incredible anxiety tried topamax but hated the side effects im bipolar 2 so i think im wanting to try a single medicine therapy ive been reading on it and i would love to just take seroquel at night,0
yep ive got klonopin (clonazepam) lamictal and cymbalta on board but actually going to the doctor today as depression/anxiety have gotten worse lately jill jorgensen i was wondering if bipolar and bpd could co-exist i knew it! yay for us  we get both :( though i have bipolar type 2 my best to everyone youre not alone,1
my heart breaks for you sending you love light and healing from south africa i am also living a nightmare with severe depression and anxiety an the lack of understanding and empathy by those around me never ceases to shock mehow i wish i was terminally ill then id know my hell would end soon,0
im not sure what you mean by "sleep anxiety" but i have awful insomnia from anxiety and on the rare occasion i get some sleep i have woken up because of anxiety i wake up with awful chest pains and racing thoughts i would say anxiety can def wake you up also i know meds work different for everyone but personally wellbutrin gave me horrific anxiety so if your anxiety got worse after starting wellbutrin you might want to talk to your dr about that,1
yep welbutrin was an anxiety producer for me too ive been thru so many med changes and trials it would make your head spin (or mine lol) hang in there with the med changes until they find the right ones for you im on clonazepam at night seems to keep the anxiety away and i sleep pretty well (at least better than before) also soft music/meditation can be so helpful,1
yeah id never had anxiety before i tried wellbutrin i know all drugs work differently for people and its probably a miracle drug for some but that was the worst drug reaction i ever had and it was scary and awful,0
im sorry you are feeling so ill yes sleep anxiety can wake you up anxiety can really mess with sleep and can cause stomach upsets try looking up mindfulness there are phone apps as well its a way to help treat anxiety it helps me a lot especially if i start to flip out before bed its a way of focusing on the present and leaving anxiety behind all the best,1
sadly this happens all too often i only have 5 people i can depend on 3 of those being family members unfortunately this disorder brings us to be more attached and love deeper than the other person possibly could this leads to half hearted friendships not to mention that some people are unable to handle the constant mood swings and stress it causes this is the sad truth we are different and we are not normal in the eyes of society but we are still beautiful we are still useful and we still deserve love you will have only a few who can even try to comprehend only a few who can handle you at your worst and love you still the pain of losing friends and not understanding is so painful but i want you to know that even if you just have one person thats something that some people dont even have if she wants to cut ties let her you deserve friends who wont drop you for a boy or because theyre too busy,0
some people though they seem like forever friends really arent they are just those ones who sadly pass through our lives i am horrible at keeping in contact with long distance friends most of the time because i rarely reach out on my own but if someone messages or i manage to call someone we talk for ages life gets hectic but if she wont contact you back then shes not worth it you already did the easy part i understand the fear of abandonment i have severe abandonment and sometimes its hard to really understand that very few people are an actual constant in your life i rely on animals and my immediate family for consistency,0
easier said then done but its alot less struggle to just let it go then to try and carry the torch which may never be relit try to get a solid network of friends and maybe at times ponder what couldve been but trying to live in that past is a dangerous blanket so familiar yet so cold moving forward is what life is experiences moments and those who stayed til the end so keep your head up and stop blaming yourself as if your the one who caused the separation and try to look at it for what it is two people grown apart and no amount of tape can change what it is,0
your not alone my friends have moved away even really really good friends and i barely hear from them you sound a bit like me fear abandonment i have my blended family (which offers enough stress) and work and pretty much no friends im tired of being the one trying to maintain contact its sad but dont really have friends the last couple i lost were not real friends in the end,0
cindy muhlenburg border it was a struggle to get off the seroquel but once the doctor got things changed for me i really sleep much better plus i stopped drinking soda and eating junk food talk to your doctor thats the best thing to do - good luck!,1
im scared to try new meds,1
i should add that i have chronic pain from degenitive disc disease i have titanium in c4-c7 i have chronic migraine as well as due to a seizure no left collarbone so exercise is hard for me thats why im doing water therapy its so hard for me to stay active as it really gives me anxiety to be around people,0
i have bipolar 2 and take effexor and wellbutrin in am and 600 mg (neurontin) gabapentin + 5 mg clonazepam at night has not been a problem at all i have an anxiety disorder as well never was on seroquel or remeron but did take saphris at night for a while which was great for sleep but did gain weight and had to quit because i couldnt afford it also still have left over weight gain from a trial of lithium that just made me too sluggish hope this helps,1
very helpful i took wellbutrin for years but it caused me to have grand mal seizures during 1 i broke my collarbone and it never healed and had to be removed i also have anxiety and take xanax as needed,1
when it was just 20 pounds i accepted it but now that its 50+ lbs i think its unacceptable my primary dr is upset he says he gives remeron to his patients that need to gain weight he also said i could become diabetic so frustrated!,0
i really got irritated yesterday when someone posted in summation that weight gain is a small price to pay for mental health ummmm no! if said weight gain worsens depression and anxiety then it is not a small price to pay we have enough problems without having to fight a battle against the scales,1
i am on 200 mg of neurotin at bedtime for a total of 600 mg per day seroquel is the guilty party in weight gain i used to be on 300 mg each eve & gained as much weight as you no matter what i do it is impossible to lose i have tried exercise and different diets (i don t eat a lot) except this med causes me to crave carbs at night,1
no but effexor made me gain a ton of weight and going off it sucks horribly,0

i think your true statement was wasted on 95% of the readers i have watched the struggle of very responsible precious ones and am so proud of them and so blessed by them,0
ok first of all marae corday there is no snapping out of anything no more than snapping out of schizophrenia my husband suffers from this disorder and it can be devastating and no one with this disease chooses to be this way second of all just because someone has bipolar disorder doesnt mean they are stupid or incapable of being independent or self reliable that all depends on the severity of their disease and their individual progress with treatment there are actually a great deal of very intelligent and successful people including celebrities who suffer from bipolar their is no doubt that someone with bipolar must have a strong network of family and friends to be supportive and help them when they need it but let me assure you that mental illness is in no way a first world problem as you like to call it mental illness stretches beyond all social classes race culture religion etc i can assure you it is very much a global problem the only difference between our "first world" and other "third world" countries is the attitude and acceptance of which we acknowledge and treat mental illness here for example most americans have compassion and acceptance of mental illness without blaming the person who suffers while a smaller number of douchebags such as yourself have no understanding or sympathy of anyone elses pain except your own and just expect people to snap out of something they can not control let me tell you one thing right now there has always been a disgusting stigma associated with mental illness that it is somehow bull shit or can be prevented or avoided which is further perpetuated by people like you but there is absolutely no difference between mental illness and any other physical diseases such as cancer or diabetes it is a physical chemical/hormonal imbalance of the brain would you tell someone with cancer or diabetes to snap out of it? if you cant educate yourself on such matters and have an enlightened and intelligent point of view on such matters then it would probably be more beneficial for you to refrain from commenting your idiocy because it reflects poorly on your character and makes you look like a horses ass,0
melissa hobson i doubt youd be bothered to read this but,0
being bipolar and having bipolar disorder is two different things everyones case is different there was a point i legitimately couldnt work for eight months trying to find the right mess struggling with bad side effects or having bad episodes in the middle of work i never got help from the government but thats each persons decision to make when i got better it wasnt just easy to get back into the swing of things because of my "personality" its always hard keeping a job people dont appeal to my personality no i couldnt snap out of it to take care of myself my family helped me if i didnt have my family it couldve gone a lot worse and not everyone has a support system,1
marae corday the system is overwhelmed because it is chronically and terribly under-resourced has been for a long time your self-stigma and community stigma of mental health is part of the problem we need to be part of the solution - wake up!,1
ill try i said most yes some are so affected by this that they cant function and they become homeless but what is the solution? we have any overwhelmed ss system  i was diagnosed bipolar i work because i have a family and myself to take care of but i feel overwhelmed so much at work i often feel it would be better to be dead,0
bipolar disorder is a spectrum mood disorder theres type i ii and cyclothymic which is a less severe classification between i and ii with type i the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania type ii (which is what i have) you experience whats called hypomania a less severe form of type type is mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal oriented but with a short temper the cycles for type ii are shorter and more frequent cyclothymia is when you have frequent cycles between being "low" but not suicidally depressed and hypomanic you operate closer to baseline but you have frequent episodes between depression and hypomania type ii however is where you have cycles between hypomania and extreme suicidal depression type i can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania but type ii sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation the good news however is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist,1
i havent been diagnosed with a stage yet i am manic for longer periods than i am down but drop fast and hard i get suicidal ideation i used to act on it when young twice but was savedluckily i have learned to cope but its a daily struggle,0
type 2 can also be manic and depressive at the same time that is when i honestly feel like i am going crazy and i truly need to watch my suicidal thoughts if i had the studys link i would post it but for every manic episode in a type 1 there are around 4 depressive episodes for type 2 that ratio becomes 1:40 type 1 manic is also more in the "normal" range than a type 1s both types are horrible though i dont wish them on anyone unfortunately my son has it too and is rapid cycling like i am,0
1 is not worse they are both equally difficult in different ways with 1 the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania type 2 (which is what i have) you experience whats called hypomania a less severe form of type 1s mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal oriented but with a short temper the cycles with type 2 are more frequent than type 1 what is dangerous about type 2 however is the extreme suicidal depression type 1 can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania but type 2 sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation so no type 2 is in no way less difficult than type 1 the good news however is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist,1
i try to enjoy each day i embrace the high days but i dread the days that i begin to feel bad bc i know the first day of down is the best day and its gonna get way worse before i start to level out,0
im troubled i have this friend 20 years since we first met and he doesnt know anything about my issues he is such a great friend its like having another brother at one point he came to visit so my niece has issues and she once told him how she suffers so i made mention one day of a situation she was in then said to him i feel so sorry for her family cause shes a constant embarrassment to them then i said ur lucky u dont have any one u know who has mental illness he looked at me and said oh god no if i found out they did i couldnt cope with that so for that reason and even though hes a wonderful friend i didnt tell him and most likely never will sigh in my life i had two nervous breakdowns and he did come with my mum to visit me in the hospital but the way he reacted to my comments that day im not sure if telling him about my issues is the right thing for me to do ,0
there is a gene for anxiety; namely slc6a4,1
it took me a long time to find the right combination of meds but have finally found one that works and have been on it for a few years now and it does surprise you and even scare you when things finally start to even out i get the fear of the "inevitable" crash but try to be positive because that crash isnt guaranteed,1
ive been told when im dealing with stress i have to try with some coping mechanism its easy for someone who has a normal brain but for us its trying to tell a deaf person they should try to listen ,0
i hate taking meds the flip flop of bipolar disorder is horrible ive gotten better with handling it but sometimes it still gets me,1
i must say i am controlled bipolar but i always have my ups and down still and yes i love the happy part but theres things that make you happy when your stable and not necessarily the mental part of it just try not to dread that youre going to come down eventually and be prepared for it,0
maybe your just starting to recognise some of your red flags as i like to call them subtle signs your mood is shifting id say use them as a positiveput bank cards in someone elses hands dont buy alcohol avoid people and places your high will feed off they wont always be signs of impeding change but if your not sure best to be safe its a good thing your doing great getting to know your disorder thats all your maybe getting better and starting to notice more enjoy all the good days yes the bad will be back but next time you will be ready,0
im kinda the opposite i guess i go along day to day and do my thing and its not all shine and rainbows but its not ahorrible hurricane either so im ok i can deal then comes a bad day usually triggered by my physical illnesses and the bottom falls out and everything is not just bad but not gonna better and then i start ti wonder if im just faking the happiness and good times i wonder if im taking the saying fake it till you make it to literal sigh,0
hi fiona dont go off your meds until you explore other options i cant tolerate side effects of lithium (i cant walk because of ataxia) or any antidepressents because i get an immediate manic swith also cant take any antipsychotics because i get dystonia or akithesia took me 3 years to get my meds right  and the weight is coming off i understand your concerns as i put on 30 kgs so i have been changed to the epilepsy meds for mood stabilisation (sodium valproate and lamictal) as well as an anti parkinsons drug (simiplex) i used to have sleeping tabs (zopiclone) and for spiking anxiety  valium (prn) now stable and in a very good place no more sleepers or vlium needed im out and about walking  lost 15 kilos apparently sodium valproate and lamictal are now first medications used for bipolar in uk befor lithium and anti-depressant combo i have bipolar 1 (diagnosed 2012  now 51 years old) and used to suffer long periods of manic psychosis so hang in there and work with your dr to find the right meds i never thought id find the stability and peace i have nond all the best ,1
so just an update to those who want it :) i saw the doctor she was so unhelpful its not even funny said that i should have gone to my gp with the pain and other symptoms after getting upset with her she admitted that i could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests said that i must stop the lithium and if im not better by monday i must go to my gp and ask for tests i demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until i have seen my neuro to get better help with my seizures she insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which i have been told numerous times that i cant have and told me i must come back in 3 weeks unless the anti depressant makes me manic then i must come back sooner i am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today but im living in hope waiting to see my neuro in hope that i can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thanks to everyone for their support,0
first youre never beyond help second ive been on lithium for years and years and my first year of being on it was horrible but it does get better and then you learn that your body needs it and you feel good about taking it and it really helps just make sure you get your blood checked every three months it will get better stick with it,0
i used to be on lithium  i was thirsty all the time and put on weight  when they got me on the right dose  i felt the wellest i have ever been  it was a shame i had to come off it as i had been diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic and was no longer allowed to take the lithium  i now take lamotrogine and im ok on it but not as good as i was on lithium,1
i went from 800 mg to 1200 mg of lithium in addition to some other meds i found that lithium destroyed my stomach and even made it to where i couldnt leave the house for a few hours following taking my meds out of fear of not having a bathroom i have since figured out that i have to eat when i take it i found that it cant be a sugary snack but like actual food i also eliminated regular soda and that helped as well the big thing i have to watch for is getting dehydrated i can feel how much different it affects me while on lithium and when i have an issue i reach for something like pedialyte to help het a jump on balancing things out,1
it made me completely nuts i had to go off after a few weeks because i was paranoid and seeing things,0
lithium made me a zombie when i took it but to let you know you are not beyond help theres other medications that help have you tried lamical? it has calmed my nerves down more than my klonopin it is for mood swings but it helps for anxiety too ask your doctor to give you a drug test that pinpoints what medication you can and cannot take that will help with what is out there it is only $20 and it will determine what you need  dont ever let anyone tell you that you are beyond help theres a lot of good in you and it brings you down to here that even if you have another dr dont get discouraged  also trying therapy will help too it will make you feel more relieved to know an unbiased person can talk to you and bring your anxiety down i hope this helps good luck,1
i had uncontrollable tics and tremors so bad with lithium i couldnt go out in public sometimes i take latuda now it was a last resort for me as i have literally tried everything else good luck!,0
i saw my therapist todaywho works closely with my doctor she said i look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session she has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on friday to see whats up the nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains cramps nausea etc is not worth it something is definitely wrong they are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since i am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function so its just to wait it out till friday morning thanks all for your support and help this community is amazing,1
my sibling was on lithium and it severely damaged her kidneys and created other issues for her scary stuff,0
id be concerned that if you are high risk you are reactive to it in a different way than others are honestly im obviously not a dr but since you just started the medication its probably safer for you to stop taking it rather than staying on it until friday,1
everyday struggle,0
its not like im hiding my personality but when you carry social phobia borderline and others you dont really have any personality left the illness becomes your personality and people dont take kindly to unpleasantness,0
im also bipolar wit depression & anxiety,1
sacrificing your physical health fir your mental health is not an acceptable choice get with your doctor to search for meds for other options no shame in asking about it weight gain and the impact on your health (physical and mental) are no joke,1
i was on lithium 1600mgs/day over 15 years i too went from 130 to 204 i too was put on synthroid for hypothyroidism i was also on a few other psych medsseroquel zoloft and 8mgs of xanax/day i was a walking (fat) zombie after years of research and a life changing event i finally took matters into my own hands this was after years of self education i stopped every med except xanax which i went to 3mgs instead of 8 switched from zoloft to effexor and contiued taking the thyroid meds nearly 3 months later my weight dropped from 204 to 160 now almost 2 years later i am 135lbs my mind is so much clearer my body is finally back to the way i remember it being big pharma will dose you your whole life if you dont take a stand! being bipolar is hard enough but being overweight doubles the depression i realized i needed to get better for me!! i started talking walks which then led to hikes then i started swimming which led to learning to kayak which is now my favorite hobby stopping all of those meds was scary but in the end so worth it! being sooo medicated made me basically lose out on being 30 something bc i honestly cant remember my 30s im 41 now and i feel better all around nowmentally and physically i also found god during my process which i feel like that in itself is the biggest trophy of my life without god i would not have been able to go off all those psych meds and keep what little sanity i had left i thought lithium was the best drug ever invented to control my moods however now that i am not on a mood stabilizer my faith gets me through the rollar coasters i dont suggest doing anything without intense education and research i have found cannabis to be my natural stabilizer i never thought id be able to live taking just 3 prescriptionsconsidering there were times in my life when i was on 14 different psych medications at oncewho can keep up with so many? no wonder i dont remember my 30slol im now 41 and my mental health and my physical health are better than ever! also my sex drive came back after 12 years of thinking it was gone forever!! yes im bipolar ocd sad ptsdthose illnesses do not define who i am todayi am me! i will post 2 pictures and you will see the difference,1
pls talk to doc before stopping meds i was a size 8 when i was put on seraquel  was taken off due to wait gain struggled to loose it for months & as the lbs slowly began to shed i decided to stop my lithiun (900 mg daily) i ended up sectioning myself i got out went back on both previously mentioned meds the weight came back plus some made it up to over 200 lbs & had to sqeeze into size 22 told my doc i felt the weight gain negated/out weighed the mental gains now i`m about 8 mo on just lithium & ambien i tried everything to slim down: veggies & water sweat & tears no processed sugar in the house (my teens l~o~v~e~d that one) accountablity partners nothing helped i went through another anerexic stage (not sure of correct term but i wouldn`t reccomend it) now i`m a snug size 12/14 & scared my stupid brain won`t know when to stop loosing weight,0
i was a very unhealthy 113 lbs when i started lithium and i also had thyroid issues before realizing i was bipolar i am 131 now after having been on the lowest dose of lithium but i feel human i eat better i am motivated to leave the house and be active (more so than i have been in years) i worry about you just stopping if i were to do that it would be hell for me i hope you find something that works ❤️,1
with anxiety medications and antidepressants make you gain weight now there is a solution for that if you get on thyroid meds to help that will work also i know its hard but change what you are eating like put fruits and veggies in the house and if you crave something create something good with the fruits and veggies if you go off your medication you will experience hell  you will have ups and downs and you will eat bc you are depressed all the time you will have withdrawal symptoms and that is hard to stop you will make yourself worse stopping it i am bipolar and i really dont suggest to stop taking your meds there are some really bad side effects from it i would lower your dose on the lithium and stay on the other i dont want to sound rude but the last thing you should do is stop your medication i have seen what happens and i know you will not like it for example my dad is bipolar and my mom comes from work when i was a baby and she saw my crib broken into pieces with me still in the bed he was off his medications for several days now when i ran out of my anxiety meds for 5 days my jaw locked up and all i could do is shake and cry bc i couldnt talk my jaw was pretty much stuck i have tmj and it flared so bad that we had to force my pharmacist to fill it there are not any methods you can do if you stop your medication i would just be careful and you may be on a high thinking it is ok to stop a lot of ppl feel that way you are not alone stay safe and good luck!,1
imma big girl and my mood stabilizer is topamax it helpsto curb your appetite you might want to talk to your doctor about it if your worried about weight i understand about the stress and depression of weight gain i have a lot of medical problems as well they play a big part in my weight but to make a long story shirt i once had lost alot of weight and was thin and have gain it all back plus alot and now i cant get it off no matter what i do but the topamax has helped with the not eating all the time which helps me to atleast not gain more weight i would highly recommend not going off all med completely tho they arent miracle pills but they help out brains work the way they should things can get scary when not on meds ive been there i hope whatever you do you find some happiness and peace,1
if you hold onto anger it just eats away your insides i never raise my voice at my wife so we have never had a fight in 20 years of marriage if you dont yell back at someone they soon calm down i also forgive my family and friends pretty much straight away after an argument cause its no use holding onto the anger you feel i just go on with life and the dark damage that fighting brings does not bother me at all of course i get upset but thats usually at the referees in the footy i love lol i yell at them lifes too short enjoy your family and friends while you have them cause one day you or they will be gone,0
so just an update to those who want it :) i saw the doctor she was so unhelpful its not even funny said that i should have gone to my gp with the pain and other symptoms after getting upset with her she admitted that i could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests said that i must stop the lithium and if im not better by monday i must go to my gp and ask for tests i demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until i have seen my neuro to get better help with my seizures she insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which i have been told numerous times that i cant have and told me i must come back in 3 weeks unless the anti depressant makes me manic then i must come back sooner i am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today but im living in hope waiting to see my neuro in hope that i can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thanks to everyone for their support,0
hi there i only identify with drinking a ton of water because im constantly thirsty it works well for me so i see that as a minor inconvenience (plus i should drink more water than i used to anyway) the only big problem i had on it was when i was over my current dose as dr prescribed (past 300mg in am and 450 in pm) i was in such an unmotivated foggy state my advice would be that dont worry if it helps but isnt at the standard "therapeutic" dose even if your blood draw results come out that its low and youve been steadily taking it and not missing doses im at the dosage above and have been for some time after tapering down it still helps immensely so in my opinion dont be afraid to tell your doc to lower dose or even see if there is something else entirely even if youve tried s ton of different meds i know i didnt tough on all your concerns but i hope this helped a bit i wish someone had told me sooner that the "standard" therapeutic dose is what most people are on but some people are different and their dose that works for them can be different best of luck to you ❤️,1
i was on lithium for 9 years it worked amazingly but is a terrible drug it dehydrates you because it has high concentrations of sodium in it which first off do serious damage to your kidneys secondly it makes you drink a lot if you get even the slightest bit dehydrated on it it turns all your body organs toxic to themselves and will cause organ failure of all your organs and you can die (same with if your lithium levels are even the slightest bit high which is why they have to do frequent bloodwork) that is why there are warnings to stay out of the sun at all times and drink a lot also if you ever get pregnant on lithium it is known to cause severe deformities such as missing or duplicate body parts non functional organs and organs forming outside of the babys body even you can also never stop this med cold turkey or it will kill you i missed 3 doses in a row once (2 mornings and a night dosetotal of 1200mg) and by 3pm that day everything was spinning my heart was racing i felt nauseous as hell and ended up fainting the drs confirmed it was due to withdrawal of the lithium i would never recommend this drug it was the absolute most effective med i was ever on but its so scary,1
i saw my therapist todaywho works closely with my doctor she said i look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session she has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on friday to see whats up the nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains cramps nausea etc is not worth it something is definitely wrong they are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since i am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function so its just to wait it out till friday morning thanks all for your support and help this community is amazing,1
let them see you at your worst dont worry about how you look unkempt is good let your anxiety show if you feel like crying cry presumably you will be seeing a mental health professional so any diagnosis beyond anxiety and depression can only help your application good luck,1
wow its been 3 years and even had a metal plate in back have ddd severe depression chronic anxiety disorder and still was denied!,1
my issue is i havent seen a shrink i have panic disorder and ptsd so bad i barely leave my house as well my pcp doesnt seem to get that when i ask for a referral for a shrink i dont want to speak to a male shrink they keep forcing me to go see male shrinks i wont go my trauma stems from a male i have to get a referral from my pcp or my insurance wont pay for it i havent worked in over 2 years and my savings is running out,1
ive been fighting for 2 years and im now in the appeals process because a judge said im not disabled enough (bipolar 1 ptsd anxiety bpd schizoaffective disorder) i cant even go grocery shopping at a decent time but in supposed to find a job and one that will let me take a 15 minute break every 2 hours,0
wow! that was fast i was in a car accident that wasnt my fault and i have medical documentation listing all my issues depression ptsd anxiety panic disorder etc since 2011 and still am currently under treatment and have been fired from 2 jobs and laid off but they denied me 3 or 4 times and i am currently waiting for a court date!!! i started applying last year for disability,1
thats basically how mine went but i had physical disabilitys too im not saying someone should make something up but if you are being treated forhigh blood pressure diabetes chronic pain etc bring documents/doctors records for that too,0
i also got approved very quickly i applied in march and had my first check in june of that year it helped that they had all my work records and medical records showing the years i spent up to 6 months in and out of the hospital when i went to their psychologist he talked to me for a bit and at the end of the 45 minute visit he told me not to worry he was approving me yes on average there is a bit of a fight to get approved but dont let fear of the fight stop you from going through the process you never know what the outcome will be,0
i have had a long struggle  i may look fine on outside i suffer from ptsd anxiety and deep deprrssion and tried to commit suicide i feel like people dont listen to me,0
they have to have one of their doctors verify and confirm the full extent of ur mental illness and to what degree everything appears ie:slightmildacute average moderate duel purpose diagnosis severe extreme when u go to eval be completely honest no adlibs no over/under exaggerated dont leave anything to their interpretation take meds as prescribed on day of eval find some self moderation exercises that actually works use affirmations to alleviate anxious/fear relax be urself dont think about things too much or too little if u dont understand a question ask for clarification before answering take ur time its not good to rush this eval say a prayer to ur higher power of u have one to help u stay calm cool and collected dont stress too much remember this is only one step to self reliance keep up the fight and u will succeed #breakthestigmaofmentalillness,1
they turn every one down on your first attempt i got a lawyer the second time but i had documentation from when i was a preteen its not easy but its a huge relief when they validate how hard you struggle everyday,0
i have and been denied twice now and my mom it took almost 6 years for her to get hers to qualify you have to see a dr at least once a month and the dr has to say that you unable to work for whatever reason anxiety ptsd whatever and thats the main thing because they will suggests different jobs that they think youll be able to do like answering the phone or filing paperwork stuff that seems easy or manageable for them so get a lawyer and make sure you have all your medical records especially anything staying you cant work good luck,1
yeah you have to see a psychiatrist at least once a month and when youre applying for things like this its better to get your psychiatrist to write you a letter to give as proof as they can describe it better?? well for me that was easier as i struggle putting emotions into words but its hard to get taken seriously they mainly consider those who also have major physical effects too so like with me  i black out alot and become unresponsive but even with that information i have still been rejected,0
you can get one of those pay after you win lawyers so you dont have to go to court all the time i get super anxious about stuff like this too but keep pushing forward any little bit of progress is still progress,0
do you know if it is required to see the psychiatrist or psycologist once a month? i see my psychiatrist once every 12 weeks for med checks (because of my insurance) but i see my therapist once to twice a month depending on the time of year and some times as often as weekly (i was denied once and got anxious about seeing a judge so i am about to apply again),1
and job that they say that you can do disqualify s you if you have one dont worry you still have another oneaee not disabled!,0
olanzapine is the best drug to be on is you have either bipolar or schizophrenia my diagnosis is changed from time to time i am definitely bipolar but at times the features of the illness change where there are paranoid themes delusions and random voices this is called schizoaffective and it is possible to swing between both spheres im from australia and initially olanzapine was only prescribed for schitzo disorders when i was put on olanzapine i have been the best i have ever been most of the time only problem is an issue is weight gain and severe munchiesif you had full blown schizophrenia you would not be able to hold down a job you would be crippled by the voices and psychoses and not be able to function well in society go with it bipolar can be great when its not out of control for motivation creativity artistic persuits and holding down a job and doing it well the self harm thing has never been an issue with me but there are therapies that you can use to stop that destructive behaviour im told its a distraction from the pain that you may be going through i wish you all the best,1
my moods are leveled out but its definitely not a "quick fix" or "happy pills" i still struggle a lot,0
i get some of my worst panic attacks right before i fall asleep,1
except the night terrors,0
unless i get too hot then i have disturbing dreams like last night woke up disturbed,0
ive felt this and been woken by panic attacks,0
it really depends on who you have helping you if you have recorded history of issues and a good knowledgeable case worker it will be much easier i havent gone on disability they offered to send it through for me but i didnt want to but i used to work for a company that handled cases for people on unemployment going through disability working with vocational rehab consultants and it really is surprising what gets denied and what gets approved (that is why i stressed the case worker),1
i was granted ssdi surprisingly quickly i filled out the paper work with a social worker provided by my mental health care clinic when i was getting treatment i am diagnosed with anxiety mdd and bp 2 just keep in mind disability isnt "free money" it is barely enough to cover expenses and youll still need other help with food housing and maybe even extra insurance to help with things not covered by medicare (which can be a lot) not to mention they will routinely decide that you owe fees and will withhold some of your funds this may become a larger problem with the way congress is going and can vary by state regulations,1
i have bipolar disorder panic and anxiety disorders borderline personality disorder paranoid personality disorder and a few more i cant remember off the top,1
i did not use a lawyer i just went to my local as office had them help me fill them out and they asked me over 1000 questions  when they are talking to you dont be scared to answer honestly even if its embarrassing or whatnot because then they will think you are just fine,0
i was denied initially which is common unless you are mostly dead i got a lawyer and we have been working on it hes handled everything contacts my drs sends them questioners and collects the information we need i finally just got my hearing date in september (its been like almost 2 years since i appealed) my drs are fully behind me and my lawyer knows he doesnt get paid if i dont get get the disability so many times if they feel there is no chance they wont take your case at all i have a hard time talking about my mental issues but hes told me that is not the day to to hide away and pretend it is all ok dont lie dont overdue it but be honest about your worst days what its truly like for you you have 30-40 minutes of me and the judge asking you questions about your mental health please dont tell us youre ok when youre not there is also another person i guess that will be there that will be judging my answers and information and in his opinion am i able to work he has never met me and is simply going by the hearing my lawyer and the judge will question him too then it can be a while before i get my answer about the hearing as well my psychiatrist told me she believes ill get it and she cant believe i am not on it already she was very clear in her opinions my therapist is being grilled and she is very clear about how detrimental it is for me to work ive also got spine issues (4 spine surgeries in 2 years chronic migraine syndrome that actually landed me in the hospital for a week last month) so they are submitting those files too and asking my neurologist for his input there is no point asking my ortho surgeon my lawyer says ortho surgeons are almost impossible to get to help with disability benefits so it can be done but its a long frustrating road they usually will back date your payments to the original date you applied if you get a lawyer they will take a percentage of that which is a small price to pay to not have to navigate through this alone ive not heard many people win this on their own ive got bi polar 1 rapid cycling with psychosis ptsd anxiety and borderline personality disorder hope this helps answer some of your questions,0
was approved about 10 years ago for bi-polar ii anxiety panic attacks depression etc (after being denied 2 years prior) however have spent the last 5 months being reviewed to see if im still disabledwhich has only made my condition worse but social security continues to drag this out so even if you get approved there is no guarantee how long it will last,1
i have a success story i have agoraphobia bipolar gad and panic attacks i used a company called ssdc services (you can google them) who did all the paperwork over the phone and mail i was approved my first time after only four months i suggest you call this group and see what they can do for you good luck!,1
im currently on the road to getting my ssd for my mental health i have severe general anxiety disorder plus bipolar disorder and depression along with leg problems good luck tho,1
they straight up denied me three times now and i was diagnosed with complex ptsd general anxiety disorder bipolar anger issues  havent been able to get a good job in years i work now for minimum wage and get if im lucky 12 to 20 every two weeks i have to float bills just to keep the services on plan on reapplying again but i wont get it even though i fall well within the guidlines their own doctor told them i needed it,1
was diagnosed 7 years ago but have struggled for 30+ yrs finally on sickness benefit this yr lots of paperwork drs apps and drs reports that said it is worth it as we also got my hubby onto carers for wen i am too unwell to be left alone he was able to also join the carers assoc and we get food vouchers and stuff when we need them centrelink website has forms to download if u r in victoria,0
i am bipolar 2 have severe panic and anxiety ptsd along with a few other health issues i have been dealing with this for years and just received my denial letter so am currently appealing through an attorney it is a very long tough process good luck to you and once you start dont give up,1
i can only tell you about my experience but i also have diabetes and chronic pain from migraines i have major depressive disorder ptsd and anxiety i had help from a legai aid paralegal and she was incredibly helpful i would not have been able to fill out all the paperwork without her both my physician and the psychologist i was seeing filled out paperwork to send in it took months to hear anything i was *incredibly* lucky in that i wasnt denied the first time and so i didnt need to reapply and/or see a judge most people like 99% have to file an appeal i know of only one other person who did not have to get an appeal and she lost two inches in height from a compressed spine i dont know but for me it might have been because i have both mental and physical issues good luck,1
i couldnt share the original post from vellum and vinyl so i copied and pasted it: "psa no one fucking tells you this so here it is: when signing out forms to apply for disability / filling out a form for diagnosis you’re supposed to fill it out as you on your worst days like i filled out forms that said i could do most things usually like my doctor added in the conditions like “yeah they can feed themselves when not stressed” “they can do this when not stressed” but how i should have filled it out was more like “some days i can’t feed myself” “some days i can’t leave the house” my doctor didn’t even know this but i talked to someone who had worked with people with both developmental and intellectual disabilities for a number of years and she told me to write down how it is for your bad days this should be a thing they tell you but it isn’t part of the reason i didn’t get my autism diagnosis as soon as i should have is because i filled out forms wrong!",0
i have the problem every time i have to leave my home i have dissociative disorder ptsd gad agoraphobia and major depression omg i hate leaving my home its a struggle to go but do what you have to do for your quality of life,0
i get nervous and anxious sometimes too it seems to come from nowhere and for no reason,0
oh yeh! weeks of restless sleep compounding the anxiety we normally feel! no-one who hasnt suffered it understands the hell this illness puts us through!,0
yes im the same if i get out of my daily ruteen and if i got to viset drs i dread it just get paranoyed about people that will be in waiting room,0
i have been tormented by depression for about 20 years ive tried almost every antidepressant and they dont work sometimes causes worse problems for me like self mutilation not taking anything for that now but i take 3 2mg xanax daily for anxiety my brother died a week ago so im at an all time low he was only 34 and left behind 2 kids saw him in hospital and his image pops in my head a lot my lil bro just laying there motionless and cold im heartbroken over it so damn sad!!!!!,1
these feelings you are having i think are all due to your anxietybecause as i told youthat is just how i felt when i had those anxiety attacksyou must tell your doctoryou may need some tranquelisers to calm you downxxx,1
anyone who has been living with mental health disorders are very familiar with the restless insomnia and manic episodes that can take place even if you are on medication therapy and seeing a mental health professional i have been in this boat many times and have found that deep breathing exercises having a cup of tea or joining an 24 hr online support group to chat with people who really understand what you are going through can really help if you are really in crisis or think about harming yourself however you should call your local community outreach or crisis hotline immediately stay strong and just take it one day at a time god bless you ,0
know the feeling just horrible,0
i have to go for a dry needling appointment later and im scared shitless i also have bpd and right now im at the point where being touched physically hurts,0
i didnt know other people also experience the physical pain sensation during the times anxiety is high i dont like being touched when my anxiety is super high or when im super depressed my bf will try to rub my back out of compassion but i always dont like the feeling i have bpd too,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page what is dry needing? massage?,1
i love dry needling it hurts like help but relieved the tension in my neck and back if you are feeling like you cant handle it i would try to change your appointment ~ s~,0
i went on rexulti literally a week after it got fda approval it worked soo great!! i felt so much better! i was nervous to try it after researching it but it really worked for me!!  unfortunately it had a less motivating effect on my metabolism and i gained a ton of weight super fast! ended up stopping it in my 3rd month because of the weight gain!,1
this scares me so much :/ it makes me wanna say screw it and stay sick if im gunna be sick anyway :/ aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh fml,0
it made me extremely irritable,0
i saw that but as someone who was afraid of my meds after reading all the awful stuff made me second guess taking it i am so thankful i was told that same advice,1
ive been on celexa for years tried other and had horrible side effects back on celexa and deplin now adding wellbutrin to pump ipmy dopamine anybody with this regimine? results? / thanks,0
what would it look like with bipolardepression general anxiety and social anxiety? very interesting,1
im on xanax xr 2mg prior to that i took klono but didnt help me i was very afraid to start either medication but glad i finally gave the xr a try finally able to have relief from anxiety and panic attacks and am finally getting out ive tried many antidepressants but do not respond to them i dont want to be on xanax forever but for now its helping they are addicting and im sure the withdrawals are hell but what is one to do ? cant live your life in hell either everyone is different talk to your doctor,1
i take klonopin and ive never had withdrawals when the hospital takes me off of them i sometimes take more than needed bc i want the panic/ or flashbacks to stop but i have come off them with no trouble,1
ive simply pushed my shopping trolley aside sat down in the middle of the isle pulled out my cell and spend time on facebook till im okcrazy yes but works for me every time peeps will stare and andand so what so take a pillow with you give it a bash and throw the meds in the trash btw i saw a doc on the telly where professional therapists are treating patients by giving them a low dose of extacy during a 4 hour session for 3 days (obviously illegal) but with a 70% success rate on anxiety and a few other mental illnesses/disorders emem?,1
the panic atack u if u wanna go  how???,0
easy one!! there is nothing you can take that will deal with anxiety attacks as such you wont grow out of them diazepam does work but your better off changinf your mental well being get a cat walk a dog music works for me #junglist,1
i take 4 mg xanax a day but i really wouldnt recommend it because it is only a temporary fix and really hard to come off of my mom is bipolar (where i get it from) and she smokes pot and it really helps her also as melissa hutter has already mentioned withdrawals from benzos are pretty horrible i mean like diarrhea vomiting and flu like symptoms such as body aches and fever thats the worst withdrawal though just talk to your doctor and the both of you can determine what is right for you there are non-narcotic drugs that can relieve your anxiety as well,1
beta blockers (only blocks the physical symptoms) low dose seroquel (you will be drowsy) or buspirone (has been shown to have similar efficacy to xanax but needs to be used over a number of weeks like an antidepressant but isnt a benzo) are all good choices; id only use xanax as an extreme emergency option and use it extremely rarely (as in id keep some around and only use it when all else fails - make sure you have as many other options both medical and psychological available as well) a combination of meds may also be needed to address my anxiety flashbacks and extremely minor panic attacks i use mindfulness practice deep breathing propranolol (20-40mg twice a day) effexor (150mg in the morning) epilim (400mg twice a day) mirtazapine (75mg at night) and as my emergency medication for when everything else fails valium (25-5mg up to twice a day as needed) seroquel is also used but i use that for sleep not anxiety 25-100mg at night as needed as is my prescription,1
i take xanax and honestly its very helpful for me i dont do well with the energies of many people so whenever i an forced to go shopping i take 5mg and sometimes take another if the anxiety is intense im prescribed 3 max per day definitely consider it i havent noticed any withdrawal as i only use it when necessary also not sure if youre on other medicine but this is combined with paxil which is taken daily,1
i take 1 mg xanax 4 times a day been on it 23 years i am a recovering alcoholic i want to get off it but afraid to!!!,0
thats very admirable! i can totally empathize some days its not as hard to get out of the house due to that overwhelming fear but other days ill take one if my heart is racing ill have to try cutting them in half and see if it helps the same! ,0
i have same script 5 up to 3x i dont use it very often and start with only 1/2 one i try to make myself go out no matter how small a step every day sometimes feeling the fear but do it anyway the more you stay inthe more you stay in god bless,0
i totally agree with michelle here manuel its prescribed and certainly a powerful drug and therefore abused quite frequently definitely follow directions carefully and never exceed the limit prescribed trust me i know from experience i once was so depressed and anxious that i took all 3 of my pills at once (theyre supposed to be spread out every 6 hours) and ended up so sleepy that i fell asleep for the entire day ive also read that it can cause memory loss which i havent experienced but definitely something to be aware of good luck :),0
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be used only as needed for panic attacks in the moment works wonders and youre not taking it all the time only when needed it works almost instantly when used,1
just dont let them talk you into taking a benzo such as xanax or klonopin ive been on klonopin for ten years and the withdraw is horrible plus it should only be short term use and now my memory isnt so great thanks to being on it a long time no one told me the effects of long term use,0
^thats what i take my psychiatrist took me off klonopin because of how bad the side effects are and what new research about it has shown im also in counseling to help with the anxiety (among other things),1
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be used only as needed for panic attacks in the moment works wonders and youre not taking it all the time only when needed it works almost instantly when used,1
how about demanding more from your panic attack? this teaches your mind that you are not in danger and you are calling its bluff,0
^this is one technique im learning in counseling my anxiety gets so bad that i panic just leaving the house,1
this is a good option asking yourself "whats the worst that can happen?" and "so what if this happens?" until you cant produce any more issues can help you just have to make sure you do it in a safe place and have a safety plan as if you dont have practice it can lead to further panic,1
a few -- 4/7/8 breathing is breathing in for 4 seconds holding it for 7 seconds and exhaling for 8 seconds that switches us back to the autonomic nervous system and calms the whole body another is a multi mineral supplement (trace minerals 2 witjout iron ir copper) and added magnesium anxiety and panic can be caused by zinc and magnesium deficiency alone sometimes niacin helps me with rumination and compulsions,1
norine delong jarrell it does work getting back in touch with your senses individually and focusing on these can be a good distraction from a panic attack what has always helped me is just remembering this too shall pass its all in my head deep breaths  slowly in and then out and it goes away eventually taking the deep breaths and slowing down your heart rate truly helps though ,1
have you tried meditation? relaxing music stress ball? coloring mandalas? thats what i do when i get panic attacks,1
my best advice after being on meds for 10 years be totally up front with your psychiatrist dont stop taking your meds without your docs approval you may have to try several or combination of 2 or 3 drugs it takes at least 3 weeks to start working i have an addiction problem so cant take benzodiazepines xanax valium klonipen ativan etc usually used for anxiety there are others non addicting i cant drink alcohol you should consider that as well just dont give up and the group is great ive gotten good advice and support good luck and welcome to this thing called life in our world!,1
i feel for you its not an easy road have you been given meds?? ive found out i had bipolar 10 years ago i have been on a multitude of meds till the right combination was found therapy also helped a lot i have actually been very stable but cant handle stress very well,1
hi debra i have issues to the one thing that really upsets me is people not understanding they call me lazy keep saying how is it you go to bed so early every night saying you feel so tired when you hardly do any physical activity i tried to explain that a person can become so mentally drained stressed and other things that it wears them out physically and thats why we get so tired but they still dont understand vikki tempest,0
jennifer wilson it wasnt exactly pointless for me i walked out with my soul more intact than it was when i went in but apparently it was stressor related not medication,1
jennifer my son was on abilify and insisted it was not helping after a discussion with his psychiatrist he was taken off abilify all together and put on depekote he was also put on lexapro(sp?) for his depression and xanax for the anxiety talk to your dr its seems to be all trial and error my son was diagnosed in february and has had several med changes already this combination seems to be workingfingers crossed good luck to you sweetiegod bless,1
oh my goodness i was changed on to fluoxetine and victran i think thats how they were spelt i had the worst nightmares dreadful sleep at night i would be up 10 times a night putting washing on hanging it to dry and going to the loo i then drove to a place 40minutes from home and nodded off a couple of times ar pt the wheel i had to pull over ten minutes from my destination for a power nap to just get me there i felt like crap and thought my end was due however y doc agreed straight away to give me back my stresam and venlafaxine okay so i am back to 7 pills a day rather than 25 but i am happy again i guess each drug works differently for each person,0
great question! with todays social lifestyles its not unusual to have a drink or two with dinner or catching up with friends i have been on prozac for 3 years and enjoy different wines especially with meals drinking every night is not advised as i found even one wine with dinner would make me feel drunk then the next day i would feel irritated and depressed my doctor knows i like a drink every now and then and said its fine in moderation so possibly special occasions or once a week 1 or 2 drinks this medication is there to do a job that your body cant do on its own so if you drink constantly your reversing its benefits then its really not going to work for you if you enjoy a social drink i would advise to continue that but drinking everyday is certainly not going to help you with the treatment of whatever reason that yoy are on prozac,0
i take the exact same mg and the first time i drank with it it definitely caused me to have a panic attack drinking while taking fluoxetine can cause your nervous system to intensify i still drink once every other weekend but i only have a drink or two and it basically feels doubled i get tipsy a lot faster since i take this medicine ive definitely cut back on my alcohol intake,1
are you using for bipolar? or anxiety? i gave up drinking and its been the best choice i stopped having any day after blues,1
i wouldnt risk it! some antidepressants magnify the effects of alcohol so even one drink can feel like a lot more,0
when i was on it i would drink cautiously if i was out to dinner the biggest caution i got was about drinking and taking xanax for my panic attacks it is not recommended to drink while on ssris but you should be asking your pharmacist or your primary care if you are worried about side effects,1
i have drank on paxil and celexa did ok with a couple beers more than that or liquor gave me anxiety,1
i dont risk any bad effects by being sober!,1
alcohol brings on major anxiety for me too,1
my next days after drinking tend to be my worst my anxiety is so high,1
all i can imagine 4 martinis would put me over the edge i used to drink heavily until diagnosed bipolar i used drinking to try to sleep when i started meds i stopped because my meds help me sleep i tried drinking on the 4th  i would rather not feel horrible so thankful not dependant on it anymore,1
go to a psychologist and talk about it you probably do you would know i was diagnosed 8 years ago and everybody has to walk a different path but i would avoid the anti-depressants theyre not effective in treating ptsd and thats all they got avoid any anti -anxiety drugs theyre all highly addictive and stop working after awhile research cannabis it helps with concentration and losing interest some strains can exacerbate symptoms so dont rely on past experience and dont go out and get a joint from a friend thats what ive learned in those 8 years trying to save you some pain talking to a psychologist and using their techniques helps and thats it finding one thats not an idiot is another storylol,1
i wrote a letter to myself a while ago that anytime that i didnt feel good i read it in the letter it states the good things about myself and gives me some inspiration i pull out that letter when im feeling down when im feeling angry when im feeling anxious try writing yourself a letter it really helped me oh when youre done with the letter put it back so that you can read it again next time,0
find a hobby that you love that your girlfriend isnt really into so that when she is not around you have something to look forward to doing i used to have this issue when my husband and i first started dating and i still experience it sometimes but i started using our time apart to take some online courses and read some books now i dont worry about him not always being around :),1
1st on list  you feel like u cant breathe she isnt dead! inhale again yup still does ur head in  so ur anxiety is totally real as u smile and pretend get a hot water bottle turn ur saddest music on and validate yourself coz you matter  give yourself permission to feel that shit coz its the secret to your healing !!,0
i know it sounds lame but i have a teddy and full body pillow that i can cuddle during the night it really helps me with my separation anxiety,1
they say to count things i get mad anxiety but not over the same things depending on where you live seek private advice,0
talk to a therapist about your abandonment issues and separation anxiety its not easy feeling that way and maybe you can find some hobbies you like as well painting drawing video games biking hiking coloring anything really it truly helps when you work hard at staying busy,1
have you thought maybe a relationship isnt working right now? i know it sounds shitty but maybe you should work on yourself before you have to forget about yourself and worry about making your significant other happy? its hard working on yourself and keeping a relationship happy,1
im going through same situation only my partner knows about my condition n he allstate me crazy  nut case physco  told me to go get perfessional help for my issues people dont understand people like us who wake up n struggle with our day of functioning n it my partner is sick but i dont call him names or wxnt to run away from his issues kiddney failure dialysis he is just as more bipolar n moody than me  some people choose to not except this illness or understand or stray around long enough to cope n help others they choose to hurt u more with name calling n putting u down more so u feel even more worthless n useless i deal n struggle every day to hold inside n bite my tounge a lot its coming to an end though n he will be gone out of my life i cant have neg people n my life its already a struggle im always there helping him through his illness n doctors but cant be there for me?? he wants to leave n run away from a racy ass bitch well theres the door buddy go! no advice to give  wake up with a fake smile pretend its all ok smile n wave !,0
be honest with him he can be a big help once he knows the problem believe me he has already noticed your swings and anxiety he needs to understand why also hugs and kisses are a fantastic medicine for you when he understands this came from my doc decades ago god helps tremendously also,1
i would say be honest with your boyfriend explain that you are uncomfortable with the diagnosis and thats why you have not told him i had similar difficulties with a female in the early years of my diagnosis she eventually found out from someone else and ended the realationship because i had not been honest if he loves you he will stay around half the battle with a mental health diagnosis is accepting there is a diagnosis i know how difficult that can be; however it can be a huge relief and you will feel much better just by accepting that there is no shame that there is something wrong and you are not the only one as others have and do suffer the same and similar i have schizo affective disorder i hope all goes well for you,0
never be scared to tell them i told my boyfriend before we even started dating that i have severe anxiety disorder and depression,1
why in the world would you keep that from him this long? he will probably be relieved knowing you have a reason for your actions imagine what he thinks now? it might help you to have someone that can help you realize when youre cycling my husband is a huge help letting my doctor know when im struggling most of the time we dont realize or remember how bad weve gotten time to put on your big girl panties and tell him also get a new doctor there is no such thing as borderline bi-polar kinda like being borderline pregnant!,0
hunny u have to just do it hes either gonna take it well or hes not u ate who you are and you should not be ashamed of that i have bpd anxiety panic attacks and mood swings its life just be honest,1
you shouldnt have to keep such a secret if your bf truly loves you he will stand by you know matter what although it may take some time to get through and he may also be upset for not sharing your mental health issues with him sooner you just need to rip that bandaid off my partner and i are high school sweethearts he suffers from depression and has anger issues cause of it and i suffer from depression and anxiety we can never seem to help ourselves in our time of need but we always stand by each other in those times of need moral of my story tell your partner if he loves you hell stick by you my partner and i suffered from mental health long before we met and now we conquer it together,1
mine knows all about my bipolar should never feel ashamed of who you arebe honest with yourself so you can then be honest to your partner im sure he will understand,0
just be honest with him lovely :) explain why youve been so worried about telling him before good luck be brave and go for it xx,0
i had a date last friday and told the guy i was bipolar and depression i know i would have anxiety and was sweating and embarrassed but he told he had a sex addiction and he is a councillor and thought i be in good handsbut the sexual advances were awful and didnt know how to react very uncomfortable and he told me might have a heart attacki was so upset so said goodbye but didnt feel good about myself at allso saying all thatit made no difference so confusing and i havent been sleeping for weeksthe next day i couldnt get out of bed and was crying all dayhe rang me and i couldnt talk to him is this normal to feel like thisso confusing and i wonder what i could had done differently,0
first of all id be seeing a new doctor there is no such thing as "borderline bipolar" as a diagnosis you either have bipolar 1 or 2 or you have borderline personality disorder second please be honest with your boyfriend if you have been with him for 2 years you shouldnt be keeping that from him- although i am sure he has been through your highs and lows and might have an idea be prepared though for him to possibly be upset that you havent been upfront with him,1
just be honest my husband has bipolar & paranoid schizophrenia as well as adhd i also suffer from severe anxiety we have always been 100% honest and upfront its a big key to building a solid foundation in a relationship if they truly love you they will be 100% supportive,1
im manic depressive and have anxiety theres days where im petrified to leave the house because i just dont want to have to talk too or deal with peoplei told my boyfriend now my husband when we started dating if they care about you it wont matter just be you if there not ok with it then there no worthy of you,0
be honest if he truly loves you and you truly love him do it you have to i have seen my girlfriends anxiety at a pretty bad state and i stay because i love her but she told me early on,0
im sorry hun you may not want to hear this but im not sure you truly love him or your dont think he truly loves you maybe both if its been this long and you havent talked about it i have bipolar depression anxiety social anxiety abandonment issues and a truck load of physicalhealth problems so i kno those conversations dont come easy but they usually always in my case come in the begining of a relationship and i kno i want and need my bf of over 2yrs to be there for me when im having an issue he is my rock! like i said hun this all may be hard to hear and def not what you want to hear but i tell it like i see it and if at the 2 yr mark you still havent opened up about whoyou really are is this really an honest good and real relationship? best of luck sweetie,0
tell him its something he needs to know if he doesnt already but its an awesome feeling when ya got somebody to help you through your meltdowns providing they can handle your mood swings but after 2 years im sure he has some idea i told my current partner before we actually got together after coming out of a bad relationship with a guy who made me feel soo guilty for my thoughts n cutting n meltdowns,0
i was terrified of telling my boyfriend but i did and expected the worst however he laughed and said well i had already guessed with the way your moods are so i hadnt done a very good job of hiding it after all needless to say he now reads up on how to cope with a bi polar girlfriend and he loves telling me new things he learns from the reading up on it just tell him im sure your anxiety will decrease substantially as well once your open and honest i know mine did x,0
woaw i couldve never kept that hell i warned my husband in part so he knew exactly what he was getting himself into lol but yes after two years hes obviously seen it all anyway just tell him! at this point the hardest part might be that he could be upset you didnt tell him earlier ,0
after two years im certain he has went through your mood swings and anxiety with you he may already know and respectfully does not bring it up communication honesty and trust are the keys to building and maintaining such a relationship,0
you should be honest love keeping secrets only causes you stress and if they truly love you they will stay with you x,0
i highly suggest coming clean about it since you have kept it a secret for so long just calmly bring it up and tell him that you are very sorry and were scared to tell himif he truly loves youhe will talk it out with you,0
i have all but a few of these people really dont understand our struggle is much more than just mood swings,0
photographic memory is completely gone ive never felt so dumb in my life i also have many of those physical ailments more meds on top of bipolar meds currently adding high blood pressure to the list more doctors more meds,1
no doubt she probably the same,0
visteral is a wonderful drugit helps with my anxiety and with my sleeping,1
i have info on natural healing both spiritualy and holistic to reverse the symptoms and ilness itself and get u off medications and living a happy and successful life! ptsd bipolar anxiety depression and all other diseases!!!,1
vistaril is a joke its just glorified benadryl i tried it and it did absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety,1
i take vistaril for my anxiety it works good for me plus i have my depression medicine too,1
not a dr but vistoril is not as strong or long acting in my opinion maybe an ssri would be better klonopin and vistoril does not treat depression and ssris like zoloft prozac lexapro and more work very well w anxiety and depression,1
everyones different hey each is own if they prefer meds r not i personally prefer marijuana it works for me in bipolar the one were 1min im happy then 51/51/50 next up be sad anxiaty for month r 2 sometimes3 then out of nowere il get up in the morning happy as kan be mind racing like mtf wanting to do sooo nanny things kuzz i did it go out my house for does months then thats when anxiety kicks in kuzz in trying to do n go everywere at ones plusses they also diagnose with different personally mood swings something like thatat times i can even deal with my own self i never know how il be when i wake up in the morningsas long as i have my weed im good but i dont get to have it all the time dont always have the $$ for it i just refuse to take medication i have had very very bad experiences with meds,0
vistaril didnt help me just gave me shaking fits,1
vistaril is antihistamine and non-habit-forming so to me its worth a try in the past it helped some of my anxiety but currently im on gabapentin which is doing a better job for me but that is a daily medication,1
im on it as needed only 25mgs it seems to help on days when i feel really anxious i can take it up to 3 times a day and if one 25mg doesnt work i can take another adding up to 50mg and it seems to do the trick,0
vistaril works for me as an occasional as needed anxiety medication,1
medication is likely going to be necessary its ok come to terms with that you will probably feel so much better and managing your illness will be far less stressful ;),0
i only use vistaril at night to help me sleep if im restless knocks me out literally within minutes no way i can take it during the day for that reason,1
ive suffered from depression since i was 14 and recently the last couple of years im having a lot of anxiety but ive never been put on meds for either ive just learnt to deal with it i guess and have learnt how to pull my self out of it now im 25 this year and i think i may need some help as my mood swings are getting to much i stress way to much or i feel down do i have to go thru 5 different meds to find the one for me or are they gunna make me worse is whats always turned me off :(,1
vistaril worked enough to where i could work myself the rest of the way out of my panic attack,1
my daughter (18) takes vistiril when she is having an anxiety attack it calms her down but makes her extremely sleepy,1
that makes my anxiety sky rocket,0
vistaril is my go to for anxiety the klonopin is also in my blood,1
in my personal opinion if your anxiety is mild enough that taking a benadryl would calm you down then its perfect for you,1
i am going to get some sensitive plant seeds and start growing themwhen i used the leaflets in my tea and water i drank throughout the daymy ex told me he saw a huge difference in meiam gonna do this ao i can get off medication cos it is soooooo not working for me eithersensitive plant is also known as tickle me plant or shy plant or sensitive weedwhits man has classifies it as a noxious weed but as we know most weeds have medicinal properties! !!!!!!,0
i take it and it didnt work at all they took my kolonopen and replaced it with vistaril i was in hospital last week with major panic anxiety aytack,1
vistaril is a joke it does nothing for anxiety its an allergy med,1
works great for mine but everyone is different and yes it is an antihistamine but antihistamines treat more than just allergies they also help with nausea insomnia and anxiety as well i like that i dont have to take it if im having a good day and i also like that if i start feeling anxious i can take it and it works fairly quickly my anxiety is pretty well controlled without meds most of the time but this med saves me when it gets bad,1
unfortunately for me nothing worked for my super anxiety as i call it i was prescribed valium 5mg 3 times daily and seroquel at least at night and when needed during the day no driving during the day though when on seroquel after years of trying this works for me,1
when it comes down to it no one likes medication i have decided to go off antidepressants and have reduced my dose by half in the last couple of months goal is not to be on them at all too many side effects including loss of libido and osteoporosis i know that antidepressants are a quick fix but after crying for a week and feeling a sense of helplessness i got my sorry arse into gear and started exercising and noted an improvement immediately following my first session im looking forward to getting off the antidepressants for good i have bipolar and i would rather be blue than taking too many medicines as well as not having to pay for another script as my shrink has told me if you remove the stressors from your life that is causing your anxiety and depression consider not adding them to your regime less meds the better i believe i also do mental health nursing and have come to realise that the cocktail of medicines that people are on is nothing less than outrageous and these people are not feeling better at all exercise force yourself its worth it and i am sure you will agree that it lifts your mood even after one session good luck,1
visteril is actually an allergy medication they also use for sleep and anxiety i have constant difficult anxiety and visteril does absolutely nothing for me i know meds work different with each person this is just my experience the only thing that has worked for me is a combination of a mood stabilizer anti depressant and dissolable klonipin i love the dissolable klonipin when im starting to have an anxiety attack or my anxiety is just high in general i dissolve one of my klonipin in my mouth and it works almost instantly regular pill form does not work for me at all it just takes too long and doesnt work the same good luck,1
i dont have severe depression or anxiety but am being treated for it im on celexa and take xanax for night i cant sleep i recently had to change doctors and they tried to switch me to vistaril for the sleep issues but i had to go back because it made me a zombie the next day,1
yep that sounds like me! i started abusing xanax so no benzodiazepines for me i take prozac and wellbutrin for depression tegretol for mood stabilizer and buspar for anxiety if i cant sleep i take amytripolene sp,1
everybodys different in what medication works for them especially psychiatric medications i had to go through several before i finally found the right mixture pristiq lexapro klonipin and trileptal klonipin is the least important on the list because really it only helps during the times my anxiety starts getting out of control like before i go to work i find klonipin works like a band-aid that easily comes off because the effect is temporary having an anti-depressant or mood stabilizer really helps prevent the anxiety from coming back as often and not be so horrible i hated medications too but i found out that they definitely help me function much easier and keep a job n such but again everyones different i hope you find some peace ✌,1
youre absolutely welcome i just started a new great job myself and i was terrified the first couple of weeks lol im still terrified everyday i go plus im about to go back to school again for the fall semester which adds to the stress but my medications help get me through i hope you find the right medicine for you i know just doing that is such a stressful and tiring process one of the medicines i took on my journey to finding the right ones made me produce breast milk and i was 15 at the time but remember you are resilient i dont know who you are but i can already say you are strong because you fight the monsters too along with trying to live your life you will make it through to the other sidestronger ,0
seriously correct ty so much im about to start a new job a great job and im terrified  i just want something to work then i read the could be side affects and i dont take it ,0
made me have the shakes like they said its a beefed up benadryl makes me wired and tired,0
klonopin can create anxiety as it wears off id be more concerned about the klonopin than the new drug,1
i took it for my panic disorder along with prozac i took it at night since its basically a strong benadryl it helped me make sure you adjust the dosage to what works for you because if you dont sleep it off it will make you groggy,1
ugh see i tried celexa for 2 months then after a month once it kicked in good it made me extremely unhealthy depressed like horrible but the month was great i finally stopped taking it when i realized why but im super happy yall found something that helps its so hard ,1
celexa worked well for both my daughters depression and mood disorders didnt help me at all buspar seems to be helping i only have been diagnosed with anxiety though,1
celixia never worked for me its one of the first meds they put me on but i have severe panic attacks doc calls it high functioning axiety along with bipolar and complex ptsd with ocd and insomnia,1
i took it back when my anxiety was way worse it helped but made me really sleepy,1
if you want to conquer the anxiety of life live in the moment live in the breath,0
i will admit though that breathing exercises did help when i was having an anxiety attack in jail and of course they didnt care so i didnt get any treatment i had no other way of getting any relief,1
if i lived in the moment my anxiety would be worse but thanks for the unhelpful and insensitive advice,1
ive tried breathing exercise yogamy anxiety and depression only gets worse day to day,0
vistiril is basically an antihistamine that works on anxiety its an amped benedryl it worked when i took it until i built a tolerance,1
my anxiety would make me cry for no reason at all even if i had a reason it made it worse and uncontollable and id end up in a major panick attack might not be on the right meds or need an additional med to what you are already taking had to increase my prozac to 60 mg and ativan 1mg 1/2-1 tab as needed,1
i can relate my co-workers had to pick up my work as i sat in the fitting room (i worked retail) and cried i was demoted and eventually firedi havent had a job since because i panic to quick im sorry i cant offer and help but you arent alone,1
this is your bodies natural response to being under stress and its not a bad thing at all you may find it an annoyance yes but there is nothing wrong at all in fact you can learn to use this to your benefit dont throw pills or labels at it embrace it animals like ourselves have flood of brain chemicals to help with our flight or fight mechanism study it more and learn ways to control it or munipulate it,1
i have this problem as well i am also bipolar too but it sounds like you are starting to get panic attacks which is often done by crying i would seek out a dr for anxiety meds to help control the anxiety you have crying is normal most women do it when they get stressed out but if the crying gets worse either go with medication or a counselor it will help stop the crying,1
someone once told me that anxiety is energy trapped in you you have to find your healthy release (s) hope this helps,1
i have always struggled with this problem ive been accused of "wearing my heart on my sleeve" or being too emotional or taking things to personal ive even lost jobs over it no one understands what it is like to have all these things rolling around in your head that you cant control (bipolar 1 anxiety bpd ptsd) it may not be the best solution but what i always do was i would pinch my leg or back until i could get to somewhere private and then i would cry by my self just enough to deal til i could get through the day and then cry all the way home,0
dang anxiety? panic? can u go to the bathroom and sit quiet and focus on you breathing & just calm dowm?,0
i can definitely relate i cry not because sad/upset but when im so frustrated then i get angry because im crying i have learnt (at work where it can get bitchy) to walk away otherwise i go off big time and become very nasty some dont like me walking away but its a strategy i use,0
crying is our bodys way to release stress so cry if you need to dont get angry when you do that crying is just like pooping do you get angry if you poop? no right? because your body needs it just think of it that way and if youre uncomfortable doing it in front of other people do it at night in your room or cr before you get overwhelmed by your emotions or just have a routine of doing it every night just like an exercise,0
yes it help but can medication help a bit ? and witch one for stress ?,1
this is a problem that i have as well  i am bi polar but the meds dont seem to help this i think because its stress relatedive had bosses who questioned my maturity because of it deep breaths dont work for me seperation does but sometimes this isnt possible im sorry if this isnt helping  just know that someone else can totally relate!,1
i wish i had advice i have just been diagnosed bp2 and have the same thing happen my last boss would make me feel so bad about myself i ended up quitting before i had a new job lined up and life has been hell same experience though i would get worked up and get emotional/ mostly cry and he would judge me and make me feel less than a person and incompetent like i couldnt do my job i hated working every day and now im not sure if its my meds not working or if im just so over stressed making 1/3 of my previous wage and being uncertain daily of how im eating/paying bills/ putting gas in my car to get to work that i end up crying at work every day still (luckily not in front of a boss or customers) i cant take it much more hang in there hopefully someone can give us something helpful! ,0
i have ptsd and i find if i get stressed my emotions get out of control and my pain levels increase dramatically im taking meds to helps stabilize the dramatic mood swings but also try to find other ways to release the stress as well deep breathing with my eyes closed walking away from the stress even if its for a few minutes having someone you can vent to etc especially at work really helps,1
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page please stop posting such small images - they show up really blurry and we cant read what they say!,1
sometimes they do this! upsetting,0
i have suffered for many years and now i suffer deep depression i used to go to bed late and get up late changed my meds and now get up early my 21yr old son is depressed he used to have a go at me for staying in bed till late and now he is doing it when i try to get him out and talk to him about his life he throws my depression back in my face he wont seek help and hates that i take meds last time i changed to these meds i did really well but had panic attacks a few nights running so went back to my old ones this time they are not helping i know its because of my son feeling useless cause i cant help him ,1
everyone on here is giving you excellent advice never go off any med cold turkey i went through hell and back with a horrible psychiatrist who set me back by many years my first suicide attempt my second attempt and now med changes my current doc is wonderful she agreed to ween me off effexor and she is doing it in a way that it will be months before i am fully off of it so far i can deal with it because i know it is going to be there please be careful,0
the withdrawals are horrible and you should never have been in that tip begin with! honestly talk to another doctor for advice about going off of it,0
every cell and every organ of your body depend on serotonin your body supply will have to regulate and you can not expect this to happen overnight how long have you been on paxil? i think the very best advice is to work with your physician to taper it down very gradually make sure you are hydrated really well and eat a good diet some of the symptoms can be very difficult to cope with when i went off it abruptly it sounded like a freight train or a car going by every time i turned my head evidently very tiny structures in your brain have to equalize and it takes time look up sites that advise about tapering off medications because those are written realistically by people who know what it is really like there are pharmacists who can compound the paxil to a gradually lower and lower dose it can take months i recently went down on my dose of effexor and depakote i would say to be really good about stress during this time prepare yourself for rough relationships really welllike seeing an x there are long term impacts from these medications that medical science is finding out a pill enters our entire body we want to be as cognizant of the side effects as possible prescribers will not ask you if you have them! they wont even usually do the right tests the physicians and the psychiatrist draw a line in concrete concerning what is each of their jobs weaning takes time so there is not a rapid return of depression and anxiety and you dont get the withdrawal symptoms,0
brooke l morgan my advice would be to keep a daily journal of mood sleep irritability  and anxiety symptoms,1
electro-shock sensations running down their arms? thats nervous system and not something to mess around with even if they are weaning this is not something to take lightly but ive never heard of anyone having withdrawals this severe when weaning it has nothing to do with pain tolerance at all,0
having a girlfriend with bipolar i see how people act and treat her if you dont know or understand bipolar or any other mental health issues they either dont want to know or take advantage of your good nature this hurts me because people will never know the struggle and pain my girlfriend goes through she is the most wonderful amazing woman i have ever met and would not change anything ever people are uneducated and need to stop watching tv programmes and thinking every one with mental health issues are the same ,0
catherine lara so true!! i understand the struggle and i want you to know no matter what youll always have your favorite human by your side! ;) ❤️,0
the shepard boys no one here will ever see it either was a film in the toronto film festival absolute pos film 3/4s of the audience got up and walked out i stayed with the last 1/4 just to see if it could get any worse and it didnt disappoint there i mean what a pos and this is coming from a guy that once a month has "bad movie" day and watch just horrible movies all day long  shepard boys what a pos,0
omen!the music still scares me ,0
drive3hrs of your life down the toilet wonderfully artisticshame about the plot the acting the lack character development and ridiculous gore scenes that added nothing but an sense of stupidity to an already weak film ryan gosling plays a guy with no nameand the point is hes a herobut not in the classic sense thats itbasically watch the first 20 mins then skip to the last 10 mins and thats it its incredibly pointless,0
the thing scared me to death!!,0
little shop of horrors or pulp fiction its a toss up lol,0

scary movie it meant to be scary but ended up being disgusting,0
i have watched a lot of dark movies in my time now i dont watch anything dark as it plays with my mental health i also think that satan uses such movies to disturb our minds with evil and wrong thinking im no religious freek im only alive today because of jesus when suicidal thoughts are overwhelming  when life has no purpose and i wonder what i can contribute to this life jesus reminds me of who i am in him loved and created with a purpose if you gave sky tv or internet ucb ireland is a wonderful radio station it plays great music and encourages and has great speakers on it may god bless you all with his perfect peace ,0
black swan very disturbing,0
xanthrid kalos it was awful! i thought the casting was dreadful that sooooo didnt look like larten crepsley! darren & steve were awful too! i asked darren shan at the last book signing & tour he did in edinburgh (back there 27th aug to see him) what he thought of it & he said "it might not have been the way he had envisioned it turning out however it brought him a whole new bands of fans because older fans were totally trashing it (quite rightly so) & saying the books were soooo much better (which they were) and that encouraged people who hadnt read one of his books to read them" i think if the were ever to do that or demonata or saga of larten crepsley it would need to be like a netflix mini series if you know what i mean? vancha march rocks and even in death may you be triumphant ,0
my gosh im definate with you here so bloody horrible that film /that character ,0
jayne pitcher agree - happy gilmore was good and so was the wedding singer as soon as it gets too slap stick then it gets nauseating rob ryner seems to be a friend and is often in movies of his or produced by him horrible stuff!!!,0
human centipede- huge horror gore fan here and its the only movie i have ever turned off,0
last house on the left horrible movie with a rape seen i walk straight out the movie,0
it comes at night good idea horrible execution,0
in my opinion after all the hype surrounding this movie as the scariest movie ever the blair witch project was a truck load of shit,0
of course it was scripted it is a work of fiction! the way it was shot was original at that time and seeing in the theater was a great experience because it amped up the tension as it went along and you could really feel what the characters were feeling the actors were given a basic script dropped off in a forest and left to improvise a lot and capture their real reactions because they didnt really know what to expect and i thought that really helped the overall feel of the movie i know some people dont care for it but i just loved it! ☺,0
i remember when it came out and people were actually scared i knew from the first viewing that it was fake and scripted still bugs me,0
the rings it wasnt even scary and it was predictable,0
absolute fear sucked i was mad,0
most lately that shaky cam thing everyone does bad,0
avatar: the last airbender i was obsessed with the show growing up :( also the hills have eyes or basically any movie where an animal dies :(,1
zombeaverlol trust me look it up its one of those "this is so horribly awful but i must watch to laugh at" movies low budget completely​ cheesy killer of teen zombie beavers lmao,1
it was so horrible it was good haha i watched it once and was like ok i watched it im done lol,0
i dont like the sharknado moviethey are horrible but i have a ten year old who loves them,0
eyes wide shut my ex showed it to me horrible i already hate tom cruise and nicole kidman but that just topped it off,0
yeah john travolta as an alien - disturbing on so many levels,0
there are some downright evil and disturbing movies that must come for satan himself,0
it comes at night it fallows they were both so terrible it comes at night literally left so many questions unanswered and was just really horribly crafted all together the acting was predictable the story was so broken and seemed like the director had 0 care for the film and it fallows it had not that great of acting and it was not submersible at all the plot was laughable and seemed almost like a joke,0
it was so horrible i came to say that too luis barandik m,0
yeah this was also one of the most expensive films to make and was what ended kevin costners career was horrible,0
i have yet to get through that movie and its been two months lol i doubt i will ever turn it back on again ,0
beetlejuice does not count as horror in my opinion; its more of a comedy and it is fantastic!!! ,0
yes it was horrible,0
im sorry you are in this its not a relationshipits an unhealthy toxic co dependency leave walk away no excuses if hes a narcissist he will do all he can to manipulate you to stay this cd be the turning point in your life when you learn to become your own best friend & put yourself first its ok to have your fears but dont let them dictate your actions and keep you in it may you have miraculous solutions and the support you need,0
you need to leave the abusive relationship as you cant work on your own needs i put up with it for 20 years and raised 3 children l also have bipolar but wasnt diagnoses i until l was 60 please dont make your life so much harder than it need be there is a lot of help and good medication out there to help you i am here if you need to talk anytime good luck and dont be afraid as you deserve a good life xxx,1
are you able to search for another job so that you can leave the relationship and if you need someone to talk to you can message me or add me as a friend i have depression and anxiety myself so i understand,0
*the truth im about to share with you could hurt your feelings just a heads up but the truth hurts" coming from someone who just called off my engagement and 5 year long relationship that type of shit does not change if he cheated on you and seems like he doesnt care about putting in the effort to understand the struggles you have with your mental health then he doesnt care im brutal with the truth and if you have to question whether they care that means they dont because if a man loves you you know he loves you without a shadow of a doubt men are usually an "eye on the prize" type so if he doesnt care you will know it by how he makes you feel im sorry you are going through this,0
also your man is supposed to be your protector he is supposed to keep you safe from harm not put you in harms way by physically abusing you you dont hit the woman that you love that is not love my dear dont let him ruin your outlook on love and relationships because that is no measure or example of love or of what a man is keep your head up and even though you dont know me im here if you need to vent to someone i have found that sometimes venting to somebody you dont even know is really stress relieving,0
i was in that situation before and it took me over a year to get out of it it was tricky because we also worked in the same place until he forced me to quit i constantly was worried he was cheating because he had in the past and things got really bad in the end i eventually just left him in the middle of the night the first few weeks were really hard but after that things did get some better you can do this! if you need someone to talk/vent to im here! ~lost and forgotten,1
my advice? get out of the relationship asap get friends/relatives/police involved in order to remove your things without feeling threatened,0
i hve ptsd severe depression n n high functioning anxiety along with a few mre my hubby doesnt talk much abt my illnesses but he does support me any way he can sounds like u need a fresh start new job take some time to discover urself if hes abusive n down right that bad yes leave him u could n need so much better hang in there life is possible even for us with mental illnesses jst takes a lil patience n understanding from ppl we love but please get urself away from that kind of abuse it will only make ur symptoms worse till u cant handle it anymre,0
i know this is going to be hard but you need to leave he is abusive he doesnt need to be physical to abuse you he is controlling you mentally by not allowing you to work through your problems and making then seem like a burden which they are not  please for your safety get out of that relationship then you can work on getting your mental under control i was almost the exact same boat(i could only like read half cuhz my ptsd from my ex) and he liked to sleep deprive me to the point i would hurt myself to try and get some sleep and then he would accuse me of doing it for attention but as soon as i left him alot if my problems ceased greatly at least to the point were i knew if got help id be able to get better  and i did and its been almost 2 years since i got away and im doing so much better two years from now i would love to hear about your progress  but my fear is if you continue this path with that man in two years i may be reading your obituary,1
get out while u can next time ur alone pack all of ur stuff and run this person will only get worse hes playing on ur anxiety and thinks ull never leave a year ago i got out of a relationship just like that one and im so much better off,0
please leave make a list of what you need to do and follow it one step at a time toxic people around you need to be gone from your life without guilt and then eventually you start to feel better and positive people will find you so you can start taking care of you you are important and its harder for you to move on but it will be awesome to have breathing room you have to take care of yourself,0
please leave what seems important to you now is nowhere near as important as your life he will never understand your ptsd anxiety or depression he will be violent again and it will get worse he will use your issues against you he will blame his behaviors on your symptoms he will make you feel like you are nothing please dont let him have that power over you i have lost 3 homes 4 teeth suffered broken bones and bruises been choked nearly lost my life been abandonded neglected and used in all that pain and confusion you are feeling right now dig deep and find enough love for yourself to save yourself i have been homeless for over a year it sucks to no end but i am still alive and moving forward had i stayed i am confident i would not be here right now hoping with all my heart you leave before forced to endure what i have already survived i dont know your man at all i recognize every detail you gave as i have already lived it free yourself! you will be so glad you did,0
look for another job in a way that wont let him find out that where there is no conflict once you get one get out of there being in a toxic relationship or with someone that cheats or is abusive can give you ptsd itself i have been cheated on and i understand the anxiety aspect of that it takes over your every thought im so sorry you have to go through this i am just getting out of a toxic relationship and leaving was one of the hardest things ive ever done,0
to help calm anxiety during the storm; try using headphones and having your favourite song on repeat (if possible) or try thinking about the storm being someone moving furniture hope that helps,1
i havent smoked in years and want the social engagement i just endlessly seem to find myself caught in this pattern of socialize/isolate and that leads tho mote negative thoughts and emotions and so on i can liken muy experience much like a corked bottle someone shook up in crowds im either going to " pop " and be delightful or im going to be a mess i just never know til in the moment which one im going to get,0
im praying for you i too struggle with thoughts of giving up life is hard there is no doubt about it call out to god hes the one that created you and knows and loves you better than anyone else,0
do you know what it is about it exactly that causes your anxiety? or is it just the fact that its happening?,1
i mostly have fear from nighttime/dark sky ones (due to a thunderstorm childhood trauma) where i live sometimes it dont get that dark during them i find closing windows if you have somebody living with you ask them to close the curtains and if its dark turn on lights itll help reduce your seeing the flashes of lightning headphones or a stereo play your favourite music songs and if you have the option to use the fade into songs use that so theres no stop between songs if possible stay in a area/room where there is no windows the most effective thing i found though was facing the fear looking out the window during it i cant go out during a thunderstorm and i cry if i catch myself outside during an unexpected one but for the most part watching it has helped me get over some of the fear maybe watch thunderstorm videos first before watching one from your window also use lightning apps it tracks how close the lightning is to you so should prepare you more keep an eye on the weather forecast keeping prepared in case of one helps i am on depressants and medication for my anxiety but i dont take anything for thunderstorms (and i only started my medication recently and we havent had one since i started my medication so my advice should work for you medicine free) also if your fear or anxiety causes adrenaline use it i found the energy from that helps a lot keeping me alert and makes me look forward to the thunderstorm rather than fear it i know thats a lot of information and i hope it makes sense and i hope it works,1
i think i have always been afraid of them and i talked to my doctor and thats when he put me on medication for anxiety,1
try speaking to somebody as well then during it a friend or somebody you live with distracting yourself might work or go to your doctor as they should be able to get you in contact with a physiatrist to help you get over the fear is it something youve had since a child or is it from a trauma like mine?,1
i have really bad anxiety and i used to hate thunderstorms they would scare me so much one day i was waiting outside for my parents to pick me up from school and a storm came out of nowhere and i was so scared because i couldnt go inside and it was so loud so i rang my mum upset and panicky and they made sure they got to me as quickly as possible but no matter how scared i was in that moment i havent been scared of them since because i had to face it without a choice! maybe next time theres a thunderstorm you can tell yourself that its going to be ok and face it! you could also imagine its just some crazy person on the drums xd but i hope you get over this soon! stay strong!,0
sara marie try typing in something to do with a phobia of thunderstorms and some coping mechanisms might pop up ,1
i hate thunderstorms i hide under my duvet shaking like mad and hyperventilating i put my headphones in and listen to my favourite song on repeat not on any meds except inhalers for my asthma,1
i have terrible anxiety and thunderstorms calm me disappointed cuz i was hoping to sleep to one tonight they always put me right to sleep and never wake up ,1
im currently struggling to sleep because of my anxiety ive tried to distract myself by watching things and when i switch it off to try and sleep my anxiety comes back and hits me in the face any advice??? ,1
katie i start by turning off the tv things on it are distressing i do this at 8pm on youtube there is the bible in audio  or you pick something comforting but i just listen to the bible book of psalms is comforting until i am drifting off very important to focus on breathing if having a bad thought mind starts racing when you focus in just your breathing you just drift off,0
is there one for depression and anxiety ?,1
i know its not the symbol for it but ive got a koi fish swimming upstream to remind me of the never ending struggles i face being bipolar and im working on getting a phoenix bc im rising from the ashes of my struggles and moving forward,0
if these tattoos help you then thats great in my situation ive been stigmatized and treated so horribly by many people including medical professionals that anything that publicly identified my conditions would be like a giant bullseye on my head,0
my semicolon tattoo helps me everyday to remember my family struggles with mental health i love all the ones ive seen here today keep going!,0
im going to get the semi colon with splatter of green blue and orange for my bipolar depression and anxiety,1
all of these tattoos are amazing i love this page and to see that i am not as alone as it feels at times i have been trying to figure out something to do to represent my own struggles as i was diagnosed with bi polar disorder at 14 and have struggled with it and other mental health issues since 12 years old (25 now) these all are beautiful and so insuring i never knew there were so many symbols for mental health until i came across pages like this one,0
whatever you want that reminds you of your struggle,0
it represents the chemical symbol for seratonin it is the neurotransmitter that helps control feelings mood and happiness it directly influences depression sadness and anxiety it reminds us that we can make our own happiness,1
melissa whitehead im so happy! im currently struggling with severe anxiety and low moods and i know others are struggling just as much as i am so its important we keep each other strong and ready to face another day ☺️ ,0
i have to be able to heal myself before i can heal others from the process or im just going to continue to drown in the guilt,0
never blame urself only b proud that the one gone is now at peace and suffers no more i envy the dead i am jealous that others have succeeded where i failed but they struggle or cry tears no more b proud of them i hold anyone up who succeeds as heros,0
ego ruins alot being scared and not going after what you want stops you from getting it and one sided love is usually real its just both people are so used to being hurt when something real comes along youre both scared to try anymore,0
its beautiful to share here without fear of being judged and to receive support,0
i lost my mum from suicide in march  its the hardest thing ever to deal with  i am still and will be struggling for such a long time  i miss her and wish i could have told her how much she meant to be before she took her own life my heart breaks over and over,0
i do understand my flatmate was murdered by her ex 15 years ago i blame myself for not being able to save her i promised her that everything would be ok but we are still alive and they wouldnt want us to suffer or feel guilty but yes its over welling sending love and hugs i wish i could take your pain away but if you need a friend i am here,0
you are not responsible for someone elses actions however guilty you may feel please seek professional support if you havent already for your loss you cannot get through all the emotions on your own the question will always be there it doesnt get easier you just slowly learn to keep going,0
suicide isnt selfish - its a last desperate act by a human who is suffering so much agony they think that dying is the best solution  why do we as society try to put blame on or label something like this instead of asking how or why they ended up thinking that way? selfish is ignoring someone who is suffering that much selfish is labeling them as crazy or selfish or needing to just get over it selfish is pushing aside questions that need to be asked for the quick and easy answer of "they where just selfish and thought only of themselves" dont blame yourself for someone elses decision to end their life dont blame them for making that decision either whats the point? will assigning blame bring them back? will being able to label it really make things better? no it wont - in fact it will probably only serve to make you feel worse mental anguish is an epidemic that is spreading at alarming rates - and we still refuse to ask the right questions we still just want something or someone to blame  isnt that selfish?,0
i carry the weight for 2 of my friends the first one talked to me that night and was explaining some of the problems going on in his family  and was saying his sister wanted to commit suicide he went home after taking me home and hung himself i feel like i could of done more knowing he was feeling that way i would of never left him my second friend had some issues he called me the day before and asked me if i could give him a reason to live and we were entertaining the idea of a relationship but he was hung up on some one else and couldnt move on he wanted me to want him and i pushed him away and he killed hisself im drowning in the guilt i dont know how to stop blaming myself,0
my dad ended his life 40yrs ago up until about 10yrs ago i blamed myself it was shameful then so didnt talk about it had to tell people that he just died my depression started then finally got help for myself and the psychologist told me that it wasnt my fault and then my mum told me that my dad had mental issues i sometimes still feel guilt but that is because i suffer deep depression i wonder if i could have stopped him by telling him that i loved him in the end it is their decision and you just have to accept that they had a problem that they couldnt overcome ,0
perhaps never which is one of the reasons i refuse to do itafraid of the legacy,0
yes! thank you! bipolar/depression/anxiety open page please try to post these larger versions of these pics moving forward!,1
i was diagnosed bipolar in 2008 its hard to live with but i try not to let bipolar define me i found out what triggers my illness and try to avoid or find ways i can cope with them cleaning helps a loteven thinking about starting my own cleaning business writing out my feelings and speaking with my doctor time to time do something you enjoy or make you happy do something simple like help someone you dont knowoffer to help them if you see them struggling by themselves smile at people soak up some sun on your down days try to think positive the down days are the worseif you are religious read your bible pray hope this helps,0
well i was diagnosed with bipolar several years ago but the personality thing scares the crap outta me i dont even much about it because im scared to find out,0
sending you massive hugsi am a suicide surviver of 5 attemptsone of 92 paracetamolsso i know exactly how you feelwhy did i survive i would always thinkim a trained nurse so openly started talking about my depression and anxiety to others who were shocked at firstits peace that we crave and only you knows how that feelslive from minute to minute,0
it does get easier well not easier but it makes you stronger because you learn to adapt and somewhat control your thoughts and emotions being on medication is not a bad thing this is how i look at it i have to take medication to give me control of some sort that gets me through my day and helps me thats the only person it is ever about!!!! you!!! you can not make anyone happy until you can make you happy! if you have to use medication to give you that but if control thats fine and if you can learn to do it without medication thats fine too find what makes you happy dont wish what others say or think because although i dont know your story and thats fine people who will criticize you or tell you thats not what tou need i can almost guarantee you they dont understand comprehend or have the slightest idea of what you go through everyday nor could they even begin to understand a portion of what goes on each and every day hang in there you are a survivor!!!! good luck and best wishes!!! i hope that i have helped even just a little and i hope you stick it out there and keep pushing and hopefully you will see there is truth to what i am telling you! speak positive on yourself! you have purpose and so many things to live for!! you are young and overwhelmed and tired but your life is really just getting started a career a soul mate kids neices and nephews if you have siblings but most importantly you make it through! you learn control as it goes on im not saying its easy because its not but you have to reach down deep inside yourself and find that fighter that fighter thats going to gain control and stability and someone who is enjoying life instead of being miserable in it! find the good things the things that are important to you! because thats where the healing process starts is with you!!!! good luck! hopefully i see and update from you shortly! you can do this! just believe in your heart that its possibly to get better and feel better! i embrace my mental illnesses because i have done research to learn what i can about them and i am just trying to live my life one day at a time accomplishing something i struggle with to prove to myself i have more control today than i did yesterday!!! i used to be so embarassed for anyone to know that i suffer with bipolar disorder or anxiety or depression or ptsd but this is my life and my life depends on me! my lidenis what i make of it! thus what i am saying to you! it is what you make it! you can overcome this if you want to you can gain control and live a great and prosperous life! its all on what you want from life dont overwhelm yourself though take tiny steps to help you reach your milestones! i am confident that you will make the right decision and at least try you can gain control you just have to want it you have to want a better life and want a way to stop the suicidal ideations the depression the anxiety it will happen!!! just dont give up! because as you get older you will look back on these times and be grateful for the experiences you want through because of the person it makes you! i love what i have been through its not the easiest to talk about not does it make me feel the best but i am thankful for going through what i did because i learned so much and i am proudof the person i am and the person i am becoming i am a mother aunt sister wife of a happy husband daughter granddaughter friend my family doesnt always understand me and thats ok because sometimes i dont understand myself and thats ok too but dont let little things like that bring you down keeep on fighting! keep pushing! dont expect every day to be the same accept the fact you will still have your bad days but hopefully you gain the knowledge to accept the bad days push through them and prepare for a better tomorrow!!!!,0
i have the same problem only i hate family gatherings i always feel they are watching me to see if i say the wrong thing if i dont say anything they wonder if i am mad or sick i have a lot physically wrong with me then you add bi polar i also have chronic depression and anxiety i worry about everything i work myself up over things that turn out okay i constantly am consumed by death planning in my head my funeral and everything i guess i am wanting to make sure they get it right i dont want to die i would not take my life for my religious convictions i just think about it maybe because of my health things i loved to do i cant i still can read and use my computer for two hours circulation in my legs i am 64 and have been sidelined since i was 49another thing is all i do is talk to my sisters about what doctor i went to and what they found they dont want to think of those things they dont want to loose me god bless you dear one day at a time and no matter what you are wonderful,0
im not sure it works in the uk but i use cbd oil for anxiety it has tons of heath benefits including anti anxiety but is also used commonly for children with epilepsy and other illnesses it is extracted from cannabis but theres no thc content so no head high or anything,1
i take ativan for my anxiety and it helps me to sleep and stay asleep,1
i have the same issues not wanting to shower and my house is a mess i want to shower and clean but i just cant today i slept most of the afternoon like i have for the last few days i also have a 6 yr son i was trying to explain to my bf about my illness bipolar stage 2 ocd panic attacks anxiety attacks possible ptsd and he was like i dont care i dont have to deal with it,1
i understand your frustration while my circumstances are different in many ways im similar i can leave my house but i also want desperately to be a functional member of society i want to work so badly unfortunately it can take time medication also isnt a quick fix i have bipolar 2 and ptsd my depression was very severe but it can and will get better you just need to be patient if you have been on this med a while it might be worth trying something else it could also be an idea to ask your psychiatrist for a second opinion keep fighting i assure you it will get better *hugs*,1
i had been on the same meds for 10-15 yrs so i told the dr my anxiety was getting worse i have so many med allergies or bad reactions i get scared to try other meds but i went through about 4 months a trying different meds ending up in these classes b/c nothing would work or i was allergic i have been put back on the original med of zoloft with with sequel the sequel has helped the panic but the depression is off the chain the dr said my fight/flight switch has been turned on and my brain dont let it turn off my house here has so much mold growing and my husband wont fix it so i feel i am not keeping my youngest daughter safe and i need to get out of this house which means i feel this huge pressure to work and then i get my mind all worked up into a really bad state,1
its not bullshit! you cant make comments like that unless youve been in the situation which i personally have! it doesnt say everyone with a mental illness has addiction its saying they are at a much higher risk of addiction also addiction can be other things than substance abuse gambling addiction and food addictions are just some other examples,0
never touched or tried alcohol  no drugs and no cigarettes so its a choice to pick them up and start but yes i can turn into a disease but just cause i deal with anxiety and stuff i still deal with it without those things,1
just written about this this does not mean all people struggling with mental illness have addiction issues the point to take from this is people who have substance addiction are usually struggling from their own mental illness most people addicted to substances are struggling with their own emotional battle and they should not be stigmatised for it,0
i can see where this is coming from i was diagnosed with bipolar nearly 2 years ago after attempting suicide my mechanism to cope has always been food hence the size i am i find it very very hard to not eat junk food (to some people that may be confusing) even tho i have attempted to loose weight every single minute of my life im thinking about junk food so totally agree when it says it comes hand in hand with addiction,0
this mentality is why i am not prescribed helpful meds for anxiety,1
relationships are hard with my first marriage i had was emotionally abused i thought i would die too but i pushed past that and now i am remarried and happy having suicidal thoughts is normal i have had depression anxiety bipolar you name it i have it however each day i wake up its another day i had fought my demons you need to find what is best for you do not be ashamed of getting help life is hard dealing with mental illness and a lot of ppl cannot figure out how to overcome it just remember even though you suffer everyday you are fighting a battle that can be won it does not define who you are with what you have life has a funny way of of showing that there is hope out there you just have to see it good luck i honor you for going for your dreams in the air force just remember even though you suffer everyday you will survive it is not your time yet,0
you need to see another psychiatrist get help fast i also consulted with the mental health in my job - useless! i felt even more angry and helpless work related mental health are prejudiced and do not have your best interest take leave and get some rest avoid negative people and people who have no understanding or interest i live in south africa and am fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist and to finally found the right combination of medication to work for me i am a nurse i will pray for you,1
3years ago i was where you are feeling same feelings i couldnt even get out of bed my mom had home care and her nurses were like family they gave me 24hours to make the decision to commit my self or they were going to do it for me i spent 30days in the psych unit and i started at the beginning of what i thought was wrong and i was shown what was really wrong please dont give up some how you arent finding the right person/dr whomever it took me 11years and i am learning how to live with me again one day at a time i have manic depressive and bipolar with social anxiety disorder depression and bipolar are 2seperate things that need to be treated differently not all jumbled together you are not alone,0
i was diagnosed bipolar one 10 years ago after having a psychotic episode out of the blue i always had depression/anxiety and had many labels now ive been on 600mg of lithium for 10 years and after so many meds im on 150 lamotragine 150 quitiapine 15mg diazepam and a sleeping tablet im no longer allowed to take anti depressants as it only took 9 years to find out they made me high leading to 8 hospital stays now i stay out of hospital but am very low and feel im not on the right meds but scared to change as ive put on too much weight already now i know its sweets etc dont help but i was never as heavy than when i was put on meds every night i feel im taking poison and right now i have lots of stress and feel like crying a lot going to see gp soon to talk about my mental health im not ashamed to admit to bipolar etc but the term mental freaks me out im convinced i will never recover from this awful illness xx,0
i went through the same thing i was devastated because in my head (no offense to anyone on this page or anywhere meant) it meant it was worse than previously thought and i had found such comfort in being able to justify it as "only type 2" however when i am on a medication regime as well as therapy regime that works for me along with healthy eating and exercise (as much as i can bc i have cerebral palsy) it is easier to navigate lets say not always deal with but navigate i have no doubt youll be able to as well with the right tools ask for help take care of yourself the best you can and be honest with doctors (that last one used to be hard for me bc i was so scared of my symptoms) much luck to you ❤️,1
if you need medication to help you feel better there is no shame to that in fact does it really matter which diagnosis you have? by that i mean it is so important for us to know what is going on and why but then we come up with a game plan when my biological mother was alive there was not as much advancement as there is now in mental illness in defining it and in treating it you are not alone i know how difficult that can be and how lonely we can feel i do know that once i started to understand what was happening to me and why it helped because i now knew it was not a failing of mine it was my brain there is no shame in that can the medication help? if so it seems like it may be worth a shot i recommend writing down a list of what your concerns are talk it out with your psychiatrist take your time and go through all your fears and concerns so that you can find a medication that may help then start at a low dose and work your way up listen there are so many people who share your diagnosis mental illness is no different from any other illness in the sense that it is an illness if you can treat it please do so in the best way for you i am sorry you are going through this and i wish you the best please remember that you are not alone,0
i have bipolar one and anxiety! i take my meds deal with the hard days and carry on i deal with it we have a mental disorder we are not the disorder !,1
every antidepressant theyve ever put me on spun me into a horrible manic rapid cycling hell,0
i have the same - bipolar and pretty bad generalized anxiety disorder i have no idea about a free dbt app but having mint and dark chocolate m&ms with me to eat can help bring me out/keep me from an anxiety attack,1
al the electronic means of controlling youre anxiety but i have found a way that would help immediately mind you im bpd social and generalized anxiety ptsd and finally voices in my head anyway ive learned to find 5 things in a room and describe the details maybe theres something that you can realistically touch or just 5 colors and the details i have severe anger problems and this method has really helped,1
about i wanna say 14 years ago i didnt have a cell phone or a computer thats around the time everywhere i went whatever whoever it was anxiety was running my life so i decided that very casually i would plan out what i called "ecape routes" get to know the area where doors bathrooms and all that seating was important so i would go quietly if i had to at disney world i went into some big auditorium show thing dont remember what it was got my escape route planned im seated then employees started closing thing and more security showed i get a little panicked soon they announce its a surprise taping of "who wants to be a million are!" so of course for security reasons and all no one was allowed in or out i realized at that moment i had to figure something i was panicking at the thought of panici looked at my kids who were having a blast the contestant ended up using the lifeline "ask the audience" soon i gained focuslong story sorry my advice would be have a back up of some kind maybe even to ive always had a back up since that day sometimes i bring something in my pocket i like the apps now one of my backups,0
i bought a fidget box it works for my friend ive had to stop going to conferences due to anxiety but it works for my friend,1
there is the 4/7/8 yoga breathing that is also taught by a leading doc you can look it up on the internet i also found several relaxing sound apps that are free in the app store that might help see if you can write down any memes on cards or put them on your phone that can remind you to breathe do you have worry beads? they are easy to make or maybe a calming cloth i found the softest baby yarn and crochet a small square that i will rub on my face or in my hands or a new one is try to ground yourself and go through your senses what do you see? what do you hear? what do you smell? what do you feel? do you feel your feet on the ground? can you feel yourself breathing? im sure there are more that others will or have added,1
worry beads are beads you string together my sister put some together for me that she picked out at the craft store they were all of various shapes but harmonious in color i could hold them in my hand and run my fingers over and over them it really helped! i have a couple now i use flexible string that will not break easily i then choose beads that the color catches my eye and the touch feels right in my hand making a bracelet is easy to start with when you think it is long enough tie it off and seal it with clear nail polish let me know if you try this or have any questions,0
what are worry beads? i have really bad anxiety,1
i have both and i am also going to three day convention in august i wonder if we are going to the same one! i always take notes at these coventions it helps me stay focused if i am every feeling stressed i get out of my seat to walk around a little eat a snack drink some water sucking on peppermints help too,1
michelle armstrong i was only able to go to one day of the convention last year and struggled the whole time ive spent hours with my therapist trying to prepare for the convention this year im just trying to get as many tools in my toolbox as possible so that i can make it to all three days this year,0
i have a fidget spinner app on my ipad (but it has an iphone version) it has really helped when im anxious watching it spin and change (and you can customize your spinner) is so soothing and helps me disconnect a little from my surroundings it helps me center myself and work on my breathing and its pretty interactive so i dont get bored instantly,1
this is all ive got i had to go to a 3 day convention put on by my company i was afraid of having a meltdown so i pretended that i knew what i was doing and saying as long as i stayed in the state of "pretending" to do my job it worked it separated me from my fear of imploding i dont imagine it will help you but its all i have,0
my therapist has me use breathe2relax its free i also use calm its a meditation app i love it it has breathing but they have a 7 days of calming anxiety workshop maybe do it more quickly theyre short itll teach you exercises to calm anxiety i love calm i use the paid version to get all the stuff and use it to get to sleep every night i have awful insomnia even on ambien and other meds good luck you can do it i also have bpd (2) and anxiety,1
my daughter always makes sure she knows where she can go to decompress--there are often side rooms or lounges that are not so overwhelming there are several apps for deep breathing there is something on facebook for breathing i havent uploaded it because i have one but if you check the app store on your phone im sure you can find something i know on itunes you can find some great music if you put ear buds in you can listen and no one else will hear it my daughter has done that too when she has to be in big meetings stuff with rain helps her good luck it can be tough my daughter has bipolar and has panic attacks,0
whenever ive had panic attacks previously i used a reverse-psychology method where i tell myself im going to make it the worst one ever it inadvertently gives you control over it to some extent and it subsides quicker,0
i have suffered on and off with depression and anxiety for 30 years sometimes theyre bad and sometimes theyre tolerable just tell yourself its only an anxiety attack and youre not having a heart attack and you will be fine do some deep breathing and think happy thoughts if you ever need to talk im here,0
toshay deep breaths and go to happy land forget whats around ya just worry about you in the moment think of the one thing that makes you smile everytime you think of it chin up high scream in ya head iv got this and march on forward,0
very well said  i have to deal with depression anxiety and multiply split personality disorder & what u say there is bank on 100%  deep breaths n happy thoughts,1
i deal with the same thing that your going through i was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar disorder ptsd add ocd major depression generalized anxiety disorder (with social anxiety) agoraphobia panic disorder insomnia and bereavement i am on prozac abilify adderall klonopin doxepin and gabapentin i still struggle with daily life issues and rarely leave the house i stopped going around my friends and family i am a single mother of two children (17 & 10) and i have to make myself get up  and act like im not stressed and struggling cause i dont want my kids seeing me this way it took my psychiatrist awhile before she got my diagnosis and treatment working even though my meds work i still fight to feel normal its hard going through all this alone some of my family members turned their backs on me saying theres no such thing as mental illnesss and said people who claim to have a mental illness are just looking for an easy ride through life easy sure is not what this is i hope you get the help you need,0
i know for some ppl pot works and for me it seems like it doesnt but when i go a few hours without it ohhhhhhh!!!!! not good!!! ive also started getting twisted thoughts (more so than usual lolz) and am getting extreme paranoia ive smoked weed mostly more often than not for 16 yrs there are side effects also u cant be continuously stoned driving work in general u need a day or so here n there to snap put of the dazed feeling but u cant coz u with crave of start losing the plot for some ppl it works tho just want u to know theres a dark side lolz,0
when i was 25 i tried to kill myself and checked myself into the hospital found out i had bipolar 2 and had my meds changed i am almost exactly like this i take an add med anti-anxiety sleeping and a mood stabilizer sounds like you could benefit well from some meds! it doesnt get better without meds i had to stop my mood stabilizer to try to get pregnant and didnt realize how awful i was for the first couple years!! haha at this point my episodes could cost my family a lot of money and we dont need that!!,1
unbelievable thats exactly how i feel daily in my life! i ask kneel pray to jesus christ for strengh guidance protection comfort healing relax one day at a time sweet jesus thats all i do i dont wish this ugly mental illness on anyone not even my worst enemy my insomnia barely sleep one or three hours if i get a chance to sleep forever very dramatic drained exhausted fustrated feeling horrible mad upset i was diagnosed with bipolar anxiety depression since the age of 13 years as the years accumulated my mental illnesses gets worse and worse i rarely socializing cant be around hardly no human beings the noise is so fustrating sirens music machinery operatorsget very irritable! its just not fair but thats reality!!! so yes! all my love respect care compassion to everyone whom is dealing with this horrible mental illness lets please continue to communicating w each other and give one another our postive in puts stay strong to survive!!!,0
cant stress enough go doctors get referal with expert advice take meds good luck it takes time but dont give up you are not alone,1
omg melany bass same here even though the highs have feelings of no pain no fear like not a care in the world i still become destructive with my behavior and decisions for me though my lows although i work threw them are extremely low thats where the self harm comes in just to have some sort of relief or distraction,0
im bipolar ii along w anxiety & panic disorder well at least that my current diagnosis they seem to have changed along the years according to multiple drs but i want you to know you are not alone even though it feels like it most of the time i have almost identical symptoms to yours,0
i have bipolar and am going through exactly to a tee everything you have just said its amazed me actually i felt like i wrote that i had to take a double take that it wasnt my profile !!! your def bipolar and its not uncommon to have adhd or ocd and especially anxiety with bipolar  im on lithium  epival  lorazepam combo right now you need some sort of medication for sure for it just have to find the right one pm me if you want to chat we have so much in common regarding mental health it would be good to talk to someone like you ,1
no you need a psychiatrist and i highly doubt you have bipolar if your moods change several times in one day its borderline personality disorder if they take a week or two to change between extreme high and extreme low its bipolar but how you explained it it is most certainly not bipolar which meds dont fix borderline personality disorder,1
im bi polari have those episodesthey call them being in manic state that can last for daysthen u crash and the depression anxiety comes back and all u do is sleepthey have medication that can helpjust have to find the right ones for you,1
benedryl i also keep on hand for anxiety attacks,1
bipolar! i have been bipolar and thanks to a great medical support team and the right treatment medication and knowing what my trigger symptoms are i manage to cope 99% of the time i have have a very stressful job in nursing and difficult homelife i suffer verbal abuse from family and suspicion from colleagues so what! bipolar does define who i am,1
i go through exactly the same its horrible and even worse when you carnt even control your own behaviour or understand yourself and why nobody understands you thats where im at with it all iv no diognosis but have social worker how do i go about diognosis thanks everyone  ,0
sounds like bipolar hun speak to a psychiatrist they will beable to help you i too have adhd depression and anxiety the latter comes with adhd but can easily be controlled with the right meds and therapy if needed i hope you come right and stuff,1
there are lots of things that you can control in your life to help you not get that sped up high like getting the same amount of sleep every night like not drinking too much coffee ( sometimes one cup is too much!) and having a list of things to do to slow yourself down if i sense myself starting to mouth off i go in my room and i get more rest ( stops the acceleration i pray but everyone is different and antidepressants cause mood swings into mania if we are prone to it i am beginning to think that there are a lot of people who might be better off not on long term antidepressants like they get left on thembecause of all the side effects taking another medication that has more serious side effects to cover the first medications side effects is not real smart i am sixty two and now find out i have damage to my liver and kidneys i also took naproxen and lots of tylenol the past eighteen years i did not realize the cost also there is weight gain and that is depressing which makes a vicious cycle take as little as you can of these meds and do all you can to be healthy on a regular schedule not overworked and discipline yourself before you get stupid -i found out that when i was tired stressed overworked feeling alone and desperate in trying to solve problems that was when i was in danger of doing something stupid live your life with care sports and physical exercise that is safe and not excessive can really help some people can take less medication because they exercise on a regular basis some people get manic and abuse drugs or alcohol because they like the feeling and want to stay feeling on top of the world but dont be tempted any overdoing it in any area is dangerous be extremely cautious in relationships ( especially getting into them) a good person is not in a rush to get into a relationship if you are your normal self you will be careful and be safe! write out a plan for staying safe and balanced and not going off the deep end when you start to get sped up notice the first signs of getting sped up for me it is not sleeping have a few people to confide in what is really going on keep a diary keep a mood chart spending can be dangerous careful in all the areas that you might get carried away in depression you might not be good enough to yourself or seek a pick me up of spirits that will not last i read the bible and i pray i like to read psalms in the bible it was written in a different time ( war time) and by a king who had many enemies so there are references to thatbut it is awesome in prayers and praise to god depression and illness are our enemies psalms helps me trust in god and get my feelings out to god then the gospels remind me of who jesus is and what he has done and will do for me if i have faith and ask! dont be alone and dont let pills be the only answer some moods are normal our enemies are the ones that take control and are hard to get loose from be wise and ask god for wisdom proverbs in the bible says that there is success in having many advisors counselors help you check in with how you are doing if you dont like one get another one but give one a chance a few sessions at least ( unless you can tell right away they are not for you) ,1
jennifer cutting the reason i say that shit is cuz in tired of people shit im tired of everything trying hard and falling way below the dirt im tire of trying to better myself it only makes things worse so im giving up and just going where the shit train take my miserable ass,0
brandy rutherford i have the same problem with weed use to smoke to avoid the meds makes me sick to my stomach every time i still try every once in a while hoping to go back to it i thought i was alone ive never heard of any one else getting sick from it,0
yes it does help in small amounts though and only used when expiriencing high levels of anxiety or depression its not good to use it all the time because it will loose its effect after a while and actually do damage and can also create paranoia,1
ask about geodonit is somewhat new but helped me a lotive been on almost all bipolar medsbut stay away from benzodiazepines for anxietyif you ever come off themit is horrible,1
benzos actually didnt seem to help my anxiety much and i was put on a regular and increasing dosage which i questioned but doctor insisted it was fine gave me memory loss and made learning impossible didnt connect the dots until after semester ended and it was too late i think i would have been alright had i only used it if i felt the point of no return for a panic attack coming i will have to keep that geodon in mind if i need to readdress things my current doctor only has me on adhd meds now i know bipolar isnt out of the question as well,1
geodon is horrid the withdrawal is worse ever experienced than any other drug or benzoas well causes heavy weight gain,1
id say theres no question youre on the bipolar spectrum im bipolar i with mixed features my episodes are a lot more intense than yours at times but about the same a lot of the time adhd and anxiety disorders are also highly comorbid id see a psychiatrist as suggested by miranda,1
i think you shouldnt have to pick between them they are your parents that said if they push you to choose that can be hard i know i have to constantly remind myself: my parents are human have faults make mistakes i turn 25 tomorrow and i think teen/young adult you see more of reality (kinda like if you ever went to someone for homework help and one day after some years your questions pass what they can help you with or you catch mistakes) that your parents arent the exact way you thought as a kid creates a lot of stress at that age alone my mental health stuff was diagnosed in my 20s my parents have little experience in this dept and i have learned i cannot force people to learn cant get them to try not to say or do things that can lead me to get fairly sick i can learn ways to adapt to the environment i am given so for that i honestly think a professional support system for you is first and foremost i kind of blew off importance of psychotherapy biofeedback focusing on the physiatrist and meds not smart for my situation i have done the opposite (off meds thinking i could muscle through) and i have spun my wheels going nowhere frustrated for a long time thinking since i tried doctor or therapist a and b and it didnt work so it must be me this is as good as it gets dont bother looking for option c same concept with meds but i think if you seek out a mental health care professional that you can trust and that is listening to you they not only help you navigate other stuff but also help you in how to address the parent thing how to navigate through those who do have impact on your health but whose actions you cant directly control i think that is huge but often overlooked not only will you learn skills as tools for getting through those issues but it will give you some solid ground to come back to and stand on through that therapist/doctor if you are seeing someone now be honest with yourself if you arent progressing: is it a simple fix on your end or do you just not click? shuffling around happens all the time,0
and didnt see specific phobia so excuse me,1
well arent you sweet aint shit its a serious horrible thing to go threw ugh could say so much more because your response sickens me but wont bother not worth my stress,0
that was named "specific phobia" in anxiety they dont have enough room to name everyones shit,1
what catagory does paranoia goes by?,0
and sometimes the cracks show so every one can see the pain in my leg was so bad i fell an hit my head never had problems with it before the doctor says its my anxiety playing up and im feeling pain where there is none ,0
unimaginable and invisiblei dont know if this can be counted as a mental illness or maybe the symptoms of depression and anxiety that i have but i bought a new phone very expensive a 2 month worth of my salaryi loved the cyan one i bought is it board and hard fried after 5 hours of use then i returned ans they told me there is no cyan color on the market anymore you have to buy the black one! all the excitement that i had for the cyan one when i was looking at it and the faint happiness that it gave me is now turned to anger hate and disgust and even a mental pain when i am looking and holding the black one in my handi cry and cry when i have to use my phone it may seem ridiculous to everyone but the pain i feel is very real sadly and there is nothing i can do i want to accept and move on but this pain has already chained and nailed me down to the ground really hardwhy it has to be this way? i always have wondered,0
sometimes though it gets overwhelming this weekend the world fell through work stress mostly--i would love to call in sick tomorrow and extend a four day weekend into five just to spare myself the agony of dealing with the same issues ive been dealing with for months but i cant i have to be the responsible one no matter how much it is going to rip me apart to show up tomorrow,0
first i would look for support groups in your area they are free and can be quite helpful always make sure you follow up with your doctor and let them know whats going on too there are also websites and chatrooms for people with mental illnesses where you can have a safe place to vent open up and seek support of others that actually can relate to your situation and struggles also its helpful to have hobbies to distract bad thoughts and try to do the things you love as much as possible you can do it! i wish you all the best :),0
this has been me for too many years to count at least i now know about thyroid and adrenal issues that contibute to the endless anxietyi feel for all of you who suffer also,1
right people think i dont want to change or get a better paying job its my brain telling me i cant if that makes any sense i want to so bad but scared of everything  im not normal,0
oh yes i feel overwhelmed the minute i wake upall these what ifs and worries about the future start settling in and it takes me hours to pull myself out of it,1
anxiety is a hell of a thing :(,0
my job is extremely physically strenuous people think as the day goes on that im just getting tired i suppose im lucky that thats a logical excuse but its really because my anxiety escalates as the day goes on only a couple people at work know about my battle with depression but only one who i really trusted to tell knows about the anxiety it really is painful to hide it,0
ian  you are so right it is painful to hide it i use to be a master at putting on the happy face and hiding my anxiety not so much anymorethis monster has a hold of me and it is truely scary give yourself credit that you can still hold a job a strenuous one as well i had to leave my job 5 years ago and have yet been able to return to work due to all this best wishes to you and may peace shine down on you!,1
only people who know me really well can see the little signs of my anxiety getting the better of me my sister can hear the change in my voice my husband sees how i stare at a wall when im trying to do something cuz i physically cant get my brain to focus on what im doing,0
so things may have taken an even worse turn i just had a mental break down just now and well lets just say it was not a pretty sight i may have scared my family a little all i can say is it was well needed feeling that tiny bit better now but feelings dont change that easily :),0
marcus i am very sorry you are dealing with this right now actually i turn 25 today and the past few years have been really hard for me sounds like youve been doing a lot of wheel spinning too frustrated tired discouraged that this is it for your options and they arent working i cant say i know your experience but im betting those components listed are there at your doctor i would tell them straight up what you said regarding the meds to us that you are afraid to go back on that because it only made things worse i applaud you for having the courage to speak to strangers on here and also making that dr appointment courage energy and rational thinking- and you have all of those you have much to miss in this world stay around if you can i know it is hard to see past the hell you are going through i get it so in that case wait until tomorrow when you can see past it again whether tomorrow is 24 hours from now weeks months that tomorrow will come sometimes you cant force yourself to be optimistic but you can look forward to the day when you can if anything id say try to wait that moment out i think you have the strength and will as you have been able to take some big steps in talking to us and making that appointment there are those that struggle in taking those steps keep fighting dont hesitate to talk to us on here,0
fear has two meanings ;) you can live past 25 since you say you dont actually want to give up that means there is fight in you your depression what it did it took your wings only forgetting you still have your claws ❤ fight man! youre not weak you just forgot how strong you are when life knocks you down calmly get up smile and say "you hit like a bitch" id be lying if i said i never felt suicidal i was diagnosed with ptsd depressionchronic insomnia which would cause both visual and audible hallucinations at 16 then 3 years ago diagnosed with social anxiety and panic disorder the meds i take for anxiety is lamotrigine actually fucking helped i couldnt believe it and for depression and insomnia i take trazadone for me these helped amazingly especially trazadone im on the lowest dose and only need to take half at night to sleep and ive seen much improvement with my depression but its no cure so of course my episodes sneak their way back in but im so happy i at least feel better to where i dont feel like im aching to die anymore because its just so exhausting i hope this helps a little and just know that ill be thinking of how youre doing and i care i really do wishing you the best take care,0
when the person is miserable and there is no hope of recovery this almost never applies to mental illness although we may think so sometimes,0
i know its hard because suicide is different for everyone i used to read this post whenever i felt like i wanted to end it everyone is different and i found that this helped me out as well as seeking professional help i am one of seven and when i was going through my darkest days i always thought of my little brother who would have been 6 at the time i understand that for some people it is impossible to think of anything thing else but this what helped me i also wrote a story for those closest to me which explained what i was going through which also helped me so anyway this is the post i read; wanna kill yourself? trust me ive been there before & im here for every single one of you!! imagine this you come home from school one day you’ve had yet another horrible day you’re just ready to give up so you go to your room close the door and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over you take out those razor blades and cut for the very last time you grab that bottle of pills and take them all laying down holding the letter to your chest you close your eyes for the very last time a few hours later your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready you don’t answer so he walks in all he sees is you laying on your bed so he thinks you’re asleep he tells your mom this your mom goes to your room to wake you up she notices something is odd she grabs the paper in your hand and reads it sobbing she tries to wake you up she’s screaming your name your brother so confused runs to go tell dad that “mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up” your dad runs to your room he looks at your mom crying holding the letter to her chest sitting next to your lifeless body it hits him what’s going on and he screams he screams and throws something at the wall and then falling to his knees he starts to cry your mom crawls over to him and they sit there holding each other crying the next day at school there’s an announcement the principal tells everyone about your suicide it takes a few seconds for it to sink in and once it does everyone goes silent everyone blames themselves your teachers think they were too hard on you those mean popular girls they think of all the things they’ve said to you that boy that used to tease you and call you names he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are your ex boyfriend the one that you told everything to that broke up with you he can’t handle it he breaks down and starts crying and runs out of the school your friends? they’re sobbing too wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong wishing they could have helped you before it was too late and your best friend? she’s in shock she can’t believe it she knew what you were going through but she never thought it would get that bad… bad enough for you to end it she can’t cry she can’t feel anything she stands up walks out of the classroom and just sinks to the floor shaking screaming but no tears coming out it’s a few days later at your funeral the whole town came everyone knew you that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality the one that was always there for them the shoulder to cry on lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you there were a lot everyone’s crying your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself he’s too young your parents just said you died it hurts him a lot you were his big sister you were supposed to always be there for him your best friend she stays strong through the entire service but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground she just loses it she cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days it’s two years later your teachers all quit their job those mean girls have eating disorders now that boy that used to tease you cuts himself your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls your friends all go into depression your best friend? she tried to kill herself she didn’t succeed like you did but she tried…your brother? he finally found out the truth about your death he self harms he cries at night he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide your parents? their marriage fell apart your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day people care you may not think so but they do your choices don’t just effect you they effect everyone don’t end your life you have so much to live for things can’t get better if you give up i’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk no matter who you are even if we’ve never talked before i’m here for you copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that carelets see who actually read all of it for anyone that feels this way could 1 friend please copy and repost (not share)? we are trying to demonstrate that someones always listening #suicideawareness 1-800-273-8255,0

how can you even win with answering this question the people we leave behind are going to say we r selfish but we know we are not and have validated that in our own mind trying to convince the people that are left behind that in fact we werent being selfish is something they cannot understand mental illness and the suffering that we go through is not any different than any other debilitating illness if we have come to peace with those terms to end our suffering remember it is ours than that is by our choice my children have watched a lifetime of a sick mother and a well mother and although if this was my choice to end my life yes they would be sad but would completely understand and not for a minute say that i was being selfish being raised with a mentally ill family member they have learned that ultimately this could happen i could also have a heart attack too would they be any less upset no,0
suicide is never ok its unfortunate that our minds get so desperate to relieve ourself from what ever it is where going threw that we are tricked into thinking this is the answer perhaps its your answer but that doesnt make it ok theres nothing ok with a life being taken even if its your own your taking,0

unpopular opinion warning: i firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind i think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help the family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt and also means no family member will discover the body which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the persons life even more,0
my perspective: i abhor the fact that people still stay that "suicide is selfish" its not it personally irritates me when people say "think of how many people you will hurt" i think these are all comforting cliches that people just use just to use it thats why getting to know people is important  because the cliches i just mentioned i bet a few others feel this way those "comforting cliches " may only hurt more for example those two phrases hurt worse and as a person struggling with suicide ideations right now that those two phrases just made it worse for me  because i was a ward of the state my parents gave me up and i dont know the rest of my family i cant connect with peoplei just feel im socially awkward or an introvert so right now i feel really alonebut to be honestsucide is not right but what do you do when you have given life your all and you have tried to remain positive with such a crappy hand that was dealt especially since day 1 you were told you were a mistake can you say those "comforting cliches" then ? i have bpd depressionptsd and anxietyim not trying to be a debbi downer kinda feel like i need some helpsome people have no idea what is going through a persons mind about suicide lets be mindful of that,0
i have to comment i am a suicide surviverwhen you have reached that deep dark place you do not think of your childreni have 3 they never even entered my mind i just had an overwhelming need for peace in my headyou do not think rationally otherwise the devastation you will leave behind will stop you doing itno one wants to diethey just want peace,0
susan newcombe  ur so so accurate my husband is suffering as u say overwhelming terrifying depression everyday is beyond terrible 4 both of us not being able to help him is dreadful nobody understands,1
i hear that you are seeking information to support you im not one to say what is and isnt ok im one who struggles with this and i have heard many responses to this question i can only answer this question for myself in me i find my answer and i can say that choosing to be responsible for my own life and yes im highly aware that loved ones would be affected by taking my lifethe struggle is real and having someone who provides safety for you through this darknessis more helpful then hearing about the impact it could have on loved ones i know cause i have someone who has given me the safe space and can hold this for me when i struggle the most that when i have heard that im not alonein this dark place my part is reaching out to this person when im there or feel that im sliding into this place i hope you can find someone who can provide you the safety and support to be there for you! im learning through this that im of value and have been heard and healing can continue ,0
to all of you saying suicide is selfish do you realise youre telling someone already suffering from crippling mental and physical pain self doubt and worthlessness they are also selfish shameonyou for adding to that pain if you are feeling that suicide is the only option please reach out to a mental health professional let your loved one know how youre feeling call a helpline in your region or if you have faith talk to a minister/rabbi/mufti/person of god there are people that would miss you when youre gone like someone help you remember that life is worth living,0
the idea of suicide being selfish is a selfish notion in itself constantly hearing or seeing people say/write "but what about the people you leave behind (of which the person speaking/writing is usually one) doesnt help anything people who commit suicide believe without a doubt that they are doing the best thing for everyone they know it is not simply about their own pain or mental stateit is much deeper and much more complex than that as someone who attempted suicide multiple times when i was younger i can tell you with complete certainty that when you make the decision to take your own life it is more about removing the burden of having to care for or deal with their issues,0
i have attempted suicide when i was younger and i suffer from depression and anxiety to tell someone that is dealing with those diseases that suicide is a selfish act is wrong you can not make a person who is already feeling an immense amount of guilt and anxiety about themselves feel even more guilt and stress by telling them to think about their friends and loved ones in those desperate moments of suicidal contemplation they probably feel incredibly alone and misunderstood making them feel worse does not help their brains dont work that way they may even think that by killing themselves they are doing what is right for their friends and family they may think that suicide is actually a selfless act i am not saying that suicide is the right way i am just saying that if someone is contemplating it instead of putting them down for it try and understand why they are feeling that way try to encourage them to get help,0
wow so many amazing comments on here and great feedback suicide will always bear a special place of empathy sympathy and compassion in my heart because i have been down that rabbit hole so to speak and have seen the darkness i fear that darkness will return in my life again someday and knowing that terrifies me i can only hope that i have as good a support structure as i do now to get me through future episodes of bipolar and depression i dont think there is a straight answer for when suicide is ok or not ok because on the one hand if you say its never ok arent you undermining the severity of the persons situation? maybe its more humane to let a person go with dignity through assisted suicide? i dont know there are no easy answers,0
i dont have an opinion about ok or not ok i do have this thought- are you ready to give up what you will be missing? is it so bad that nothing is worth living for because of what you have to live through? the pain the numbness the sadness self-doubt and lack of motivation can be the most difficult things in the world to deal with i understand completely ive been there ive been there with the blade against my wrist i thought for a moment that nothing was left that could balance this weight i was wrong about that and realizing it was what saved me i want you to do something before you consider whether or not its ok i want you to find something anything it doesnt have to be any particular thing find that thing and really experience it whatever it is really take the time to live it to get cliche a sunrise a hug a puppy are all good examples but it can be literally anything that you think of live it and and repeat a few times with other things once youve done that think about whether or not youre ready to give it all up everything every experience every potential joy no matter how fleeting everyone everywhere are you ready to give it all up to quieten your brain? remember that no person is ever so much of a burden that they need to take themselves out of the equation and that everything you experience is valid and vital to you nothing about you is worthless because you are a mind and feelings and thoughts and ideas and an identity that will never exist again and has never existed before you are invaluable and of incalculable worth think about all of this before you decide anything please you are precious and it would be a shame to lose you,0
never ok but i understand the motivation far too well we are overwhelmed by chronic pain that no one near understands mental health treatment has become inhumane,0
its never ok to give up even tho in that moment it can feel like youre doing a favor for your loved ones and finally achieving some kind of peace the reality of all of this is simple its just life and we have to live it and this is what our lives are sometimes a constant struggle to feel anything sometimes its a constant struggle to not feel too much or think of get it scream or whatever is going on there is someone that loves you and depends on you whether its your spouse children parents a friend or someone in this group that you have saved more than once giving up is not an option,0
i cant believe for one second that anyone on a page about bi-polar depression and anxiety would promote suicide for someone struggling with mental health issues what the hell is wrong with some of you? i have died 5 times from sudden cardiac death twice in front of my wife and 3 times on the operating table i have endured 6 major heart surgeries in 7 years i have severe depression anxiety panic attacks agoraphobia and severe ptsd some days the weight of the world keeps me in bed all damn day sometimes all damn week but i forge on i take my meds i go to weekly therapy sessions i ride my motorcycle i exercise when i can i love my 4 kids and my 100% supportive wife i find goals and chase them down (right now my masters degree) i force myself into situations i hate i have literally had the barrel of a loaded 12 gauge in my mouth with the finger on the trigger it took all my strength to not do it all my will power to realize all of the good things i love in life remember suicide is far reaching had i pulled that trigger the consequences in the future for my own small children grand children etc could have been dire it is never an option get help now,0
death is death whether the person dies of a heart attack stroke or suicide its still death just because a person wants to end their pain we should react differently? any time a loved one passes away its going to be difficult its going to hurt regardless most who mourn suicide struggle with their own guilt because they feel they could have helped suicide/assisted suicide is not black and white and it is not selfish- its very calculated if you have never faced death you wouldnt know the pain,0
never! there is always hope as long as there is breathe! i have had suicidal thoughts i know that this all is a spiritual battle and that god helps us when we come to him in prayer i have a slogan for those times when things are at the worst it goes like this " things won"t always be this way" i have to tell you that we must fight a spiritual war to survive sometimes we have to choose life jesus has given me the hope to get through the toughest times i may fall apart for a while but i know that i have solid reasons to go on living! dont ever ever allow yourself to dwell on the thought of giving up you have a choice to make in what you think about billy graham said something that stuck with me that applies he said that "just because a bird flies over your head does not mean that you have to let it build a nest in your hair!" makes sense to me we can choose our thoughts we can read for me it means meditation on the bibleon spiritual reality and promises from god himself and reading how he has been faithful in the lives of others it gives me strength and hope and speaking of strength and hope we can pray for strength and hope and every other solid spiritual gift we need we can pray for wisdom and guidance from god the truth is we give up way too easily and let it become a habit you have to fight for your mental health to succeed means that you fail and get up and fight for it again and again and again each time you get up you gain strength and determination because you learn that you can take a rest but that you can and will get up stronger yes stronger stronger from going through defeat yet not being defeated! you are still alive still trying and losing even the faintest thought of giving up god put you here on this earth for a purpose he wants you to enjoy knowing him and enjoy knowing others in a very healthy way we are all in this together people from the dawn of time have experienced deepest depression i love to read the book of psalms when i am feeling low or fighting a big battle or feeling physical pain or have to get right with god or find myself feeling like god is far away sometimes we are just too exhausted to pray david in the psalms gives us the words to pray to god under the worst of circumstances we can cry out to god like he did and be saved from the pit of depression fear aloneness pain trouble and attack by whoever and whatever so many times we do not understand that we are in a physical attack that has spirtual origins we do not understand that we are spiritual beings living in phyiscal bodies we can not reject the spiritual ! if god is for us who can be against us? satan is still against us we must fight every day but it is not meant to be such a struggle if we do it in powe we get from god in the person of the holy spirit given to us to be in us to empower us on earth jesus said that he would not leave us orphans he would come to us in the person of the holy spirit and never leave us ever we can count on him for help how can depression win against him? we must be in his hands and he must be at our side open the bible and recieve the hope that you need for this life and for eternity god is not mocked and we reap what we sow but if we leave sin behind and come to jesus honestly in repentence of sin and embrace life with him daily seeking him we shall be saved and our depression will be lifted bit by bit we will see who he is and he will heal us as we seek him day after day in reading his word and in prayer start reading the gospel of john and actsand ask for help from a pastor or believer if you get suck understanding some things but most of all pray as you read the word of god it is the holy spirit who will become your teacher and you will understand and find great joy and peace in the presence of the living god he will take away the mourning and give you something to feel like dancing about it is not that tough times will not come the world is evil and we suffer but if we suffer if we allow god into our lives close enought to comfort us and guide us we will have real joy and peace in his presence that is not dependent on our circumstances sometimes we need special prayer said by spiritually strong men and women the power of great faith to perform miracles with the touch of a hand or word comes from the power of the holy spirit there are many ministries that profess to be of god but we are told in scripture to test the spirits to make sure that it is the holy spirit doing teaching and the healing we can ask for this guidance to know where to go for help and encouragement in our walk with god a ministry that is of god will not teach anything contrary to what is in scripture never give up! never give up seeking gods help to keep on fighting to get stronger and stronger defeat is just how we learn sometimes we just need to rest and make some carefully thought out life changes god be with you always in the name of jesus,0
ummmmm suicide is never ever okay got it it just isnt i know that answer sucks i feel that i want desperately for a different answer myself but here is the problem even if you/ i dont think anyone else will be hurt affected or worse off because of our suicide they will be we cannot hurt others by our actions it isnt fair of us to burden others with our pain i understand the pain is awful we want/need to get away but we cannot make others suffer the way we do,0
mental healthcare has become horrid in the us one size fits all hospitalizations caged as animals wearing paper clothing and paper sheets as bedding  the (mis)treatment is worse and more anxiety causing & painful than the illness for me,1
suicide i know its a personal struggle for everyone be it the people you leave or you doing the leaving i think if we had a place we could go and everyone we left knew were we where and new we could come back that would be easier but being locked away is not what helps the pain is so excruciating and at its worst you feel like your dying anyway and when your at your pretend best its worse because your playing pretend be more than annoyed at the person whos gone but then imagine them with an illness thats terminal because it is would you except a terminal person committing suicide ???,0
i understand that depression is a horrible illness that poisons the mind its not mind over matter because the mind is the matter but with that being said what keeps me chugging along through my depression is knowing that its my mind that is broken the facts are much different ppl do love me i do have a good family i do have good friends i do have a good job i do have the things i need even though at times it doesnt feel like iti know that its my poisoned mind that makes me feel so worthless i assume that doesnt help you with your struggles but it helps me i try and push out the negative and focus on whats good i believe that you see what tou loom for even though depression makes that soooo much more difficult and even impossible at times just know you are loved maybe not the way you need to be loved but you are loved and with depression you can be loved the way you need to be but still not see it or feel itat least thats whats true with me,0
ryan hayden sometimes it feels its the only option one has especially when they struggle so deeply with so much that others dont understand in a life they feel trapped by with family they feel are absent in their lives or they feel like the black sheep of the "perfect family" that they will never have never been part of after said persons dreams of a family of their own are destroyed by miscarriages the grief of losing a child/ren is overwhelming meds only go so far therapy and hospital stays only go so far you live in immense pain physically mentally emotionally and spiritually you feel like you are truly nothing and even though you have a great marriage you constantly feel your spouse deserves so much better its not selfish in many ways after the smoke clears so to speak in said persons mind they are actually freeing those they feel they have trapped with their pointless existence and endless negativity that those they love can now be free of the burden of what said person once was,0
its not an okay thing its an act of desperation with mental illness i keep saying if it wasnt for my kids i wouldnt be here im still around for them so we continue to struggle to cope with all that were dealing with dailysadly some do end up going all the way and ending their life :/ is just part of the battle the struggle as mentioned but this is why we seek prof help be it medications/ therapy to try and have things be a little better,0
i think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way because the human experience is just so different due to perspective id like to put in my perspective i think people are both right in different ways selfish is not the right word however what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate they have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath they are thinking only of themselves but on the other hand this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question most suicidal people dont have the capacity to even think that far ahead the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain i have struggled with mental illness my entire life i grew up very poor and a homeless youth during this time i didnt even know the thoughts i had were not "normal" my mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding i attempted 3 times not once did i consider going to family or friends i didnt have family that loved me (still dont) and i didnt have close friends im sure even if i did i wouldnt have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone the internal fight isnt about anyone else its only about you its a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isnt working by therapy meditation lifestyle fitness yoga meditation etc during this time we have to be selfish we have to be inconsiderate because if we arent we will die deciding to live is not for someone else its not for anyone elses benefit its for me im not going to decide against killing myself or mutilation because i think my friend will be sad during the time i was considering it all i did not once stop to think huh i wonder how this will affect the world once im gone no instead i learned to live for myself i recently decided i needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this february i found out im bipolar boarding between 1&2 im somewhere in the middle i also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse i understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle and that incredible pain you feel is your brain keeping you alive its far too complex to answer this question but it could provide insight to others that it is not an act of selfishness its an act of inconsideration its also an act of survival stop calling suicidal people selfish they have enough pain weighing them down they already spend every waking moment thinking things that would kill a person of less grit and perseverance (literally) instead what you can do show them you are there for them dont try to pull out information trying to understand it all it doesnt work that way but being there helping them eat keep them safe and supervised help them clean up enrich their life by taking walks or finding small joys make them realize that life is good life is beautiful and people love them even if they dont love themselves but please dont add to their hurt by calling them selfish youre only pushing them further,0
i do not believe suicide is selfish if a person has suffered for a long time with the overwhelming depliltating side effects of depressionand medication therapy group therapy hospital stays and ect has not worked than why should they have to spend their life suffering to keep others happy,1
i firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind i think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help the family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt and also means no family member will discover the body which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the persons life even more,0
i completely agree as someone who has made attempts on their own life after suffering for years with depression and a fairly recent diagnoses of bpd  the one thing that winds me up in that situation is how everybody tells you how they would feel if you did it guilt you and tell you they are angry yet the person suffering isnt doing it for nothing they need support,0
its never ok i attempted when i was 21 and im glad im still here even in my darkest hours i know im loved deeply by many people who would hurt horribly if i tried again or succeeded i watched my father-in-law and sister-in-law suffer so much when his partner took her life its still extremely tough for my sister-in-law who just turned 12 please seek help when your depression gets that bad it may be difficult but youll find the light again,0
instead of telling someone that if theyre suicidal they need to seek out help we should actually be aggressively showing these people that we care a truly depressed and suicidal person does not want to ask for help the whole problem is that they feel like a burden the thought of asking for help is out of the question theres too much risk from their perspective no one believed me when i said i was sick when i reached out to people they said i was actually just lazy and selfish and a slob or faking it for attention and in my mind reaching out meant that someone might tell me i was all these things again and in those moments i wasnt strong enough to handle that so it was safer to not ask for help its backwards and thats because depression is not logical or reasonable if you see that someone you care about is suicidal you go out of your way to show them that you care and that you want them there dont tell them your friends and family will be sad tell them you will be sad and want to do anything even something small that might prove that you care go to them physically call them and talk to them leaving it up to them to ask for help wont work,0
when youve exhausted all of your options and are still so miserable youd rather die,0
ian are you talking about your own loss? or have you ever experienced suicidal thoughts? because these are two different things entirely and i have never seen them treated separately it seems that there is more emphasis on families who have lost a loved one but those who have attempted suicide and recovered are leftovers just like an addict who is expected to be able to keep clean when they leave treatment people like us are expected to go on living but arent given the skills nor the support therapy can only go so far that doesnt often get rid of the thoughts when a depressive cycle begins its not like those cycles are only a few days they can last weeks months and then just as quickly you will be thrust into a manic cycle it is exhausting! also families fail to learn about this disease because they are terrified of it and there is a lot of dysfunction within the family,0
to feel suicidal is part of our condition most of us at some point will consider suicide to feel this way isnt selfish or cowardly it means we need help we need to get better for our selves with out the snap out of it for your family guilt which makes the self hate a thousand times worse talk to some one hunni x,0
i dont believe we will ever heal or be cured i believe with self belief and medication we can accept and learn to live with our conditions hopefully without judgement and pressure from others,1
suicide has so much stigmatism to it and when people hear the word they feel like you just assulted someone suicide is never the right answer to temporary problem but its ultimately your choice no one fully understands when someone is at that point in their life all the doctor visits medicine or counseling will not help if you have reached that point what people dont understand is when someone thinks or asks about suicide they are looking for help even tho they deny it they are hoping just one person will reach out and help them its sad because a lot of people say and do so much that the person finally gives up because their need wasnt met instead of posting comments that are negative rude and mean we should reach out to them and see if there is any way we can help suicidal people need love caring and understanding in this desperate need/time of life encouragement that is not positive will only further their despair,0
it is not a selfish act it is one of bravery!!! it is the final act in this play we call life the people left behind feel their own guilt for their own reasons,0
theres nothing selfish about suicide by: katie hurley "i experienced a range of emotions before making peace with the loss but one thought that never ever (not even for one second) crossed my mind was this ill-informed opinion that suicide is selfish suicide is a lot of things but selfish isn’t one of them suicide is a decision made out of desperation hopelessness isolation and loneliness the black hole that is clinical depression is all-consuming feeling like a burden to loved ones feeling like there is no way out feeling trapped and feeling isolated are all common among people who suffer from depression people who say that suicide is selfish always reference the survivors it’s selfish to leave children spouses and other family members behind so they say they’re not thinking about the survivors or so they would have us believe what they don’t know is that those very loved ones are the reason many people hang on for just one more day they do think about the survivors probably up until the very last moment in many cases but the soul-crushing depression that envelops them leaves them feeling like there is no alternative like the only way to get out is to opt out and that is a devastating thought to endure until you’ve stared down that level of depression until you’ve lost your soul to a sea of emptiness and darkness you don’t get to make those judgments you might not understand it and you are certainly entitled to your own feelings but making those judgments and spreading that kind of negativity won’t help the next person in fact it will only hurt others as the world mourns the loss of robin williams people everywhere are left feeling helpless and confused how could someone who appeared so happy in actuality be so very depressed? the truth is that many many people face the very same struggle each and every day some will commit suicide some will attempt and some will hang on for dear life most won’t be able to ask for the help that they need to overcome their mental illness",0
it is never ok ever the family/friends left behind will be scarred for life suicide is a selfish act there are resources reach out to them not every day is a good day not every day is a bad one either the struggle is real the fight is hard find your resources and keep going it might be exhausting but keep going anyway do not ever be afraid to ask for help keep going right ciara mary voelker?,0
you and your selfish horrible comments shouldnt be on this kind of site absolutely disgusting comment you should be ashamed of yourself you horrible person,0
becky bergmann voelker - i wish you and your daughter the best but please listen and understand when others tell you not to throw around "suicide is selfish" that statement is caused by ignorance often the person has the best of intentions and wants to help in any possible but until you are living years with a mental illness that you didnt ask for then and only then can you realize how deeply the mind is at war you can have the best support family friends and resources to help your suicidal thoughts but you are constantly fighting your mind feeling like you will be a burden if you do seek help selfish has nothing to do with it seeking help is a struggle and yes as you said everyone deserves help but for many it is not the clear cut choice it is not simple to choose help when your mind is telling you the world would be a better place without you please continue to become educated on mental health in order to stop from further spreading stigma most people i have talked to who have struggled with suicidal thoughts (myself included) think that if they do give into their thoughts then they will be doing others a favor it is a cruel battle between thoughts and actions,0
suicide is not selfish to think about or even do it the entire point of suicide is that you want to end your pan and not put those around you in pain the pain of you being around yes its part of mental illness i know i have anxiety i have depression i have bipolar and they are severe i am in treatment i am on medication and i still have the suicidal thoughts and suicidal tendencies so does my fiance so to sit there and say that anyone who doesnt seek help ithat doesnt make them selfish for all you know they could be seeking treatment so no it is not and i repeat not a selfish thing and it is very upsetting to say that it is a selfish thing and the fact that they are talking about it and theyre asking if and when it is okay that is their way of asking and of getting help so why dont you try putting yourself in someone elses shoes before you say theyre being selfish because unless you have the illnesses and you can stand and walk in that mindset a hundred percent of the time you will never understand it not fully,0
i think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way because the human experience is just so different due to perspective i like the way you both calmly talked about this so id like to put in my perspective i think you are both right selfish is not the right word however what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate they have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath they are thinking only of themselves but on the other hand this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question most suicidal people dont have the capacity to even think that far ahead the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain i have struggled with mental illness my entire life i grew up very poor and a homeless youth during this time i didnt even know the thoughts i had were not "normal" my mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding i attempted 3 times not once did i consider going to family or friends i didnt have family that loved me (still dont) and i didnt have close friends im sure even if i did i wouldnt have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone the internal fight isnt about anyone else its only about you its a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isnt working by therapy meditation lifestyle fitness yoga meditation etc during this time we have to be selfish we have to be inconsiderate because if we arent we will die living is not for someone else its not for anyone else its for me i recently decided i needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this february i found out im bipolar boarding between 1&2 im somewhere in the middle i also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse i understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle and that incredible pain you feel is your brain keeping you alive its far too complex to answer this question but it could provide insight to others,0
depression and anxiety is hell to live with sometimes i hope your daughter is doing well with hers it took a good friend of mine a lot of nagging and nudging before i finally sought help :),1
i mean no disrespect to you at all everyone is deserving of help they are also deserving of the understanding of everything that goes with living with mental illness my daughter lives with depression/anxiety,1
depends who you ask the person in pain and wanting it to end - anytime the people who are left behind and left with a million questions - never i lost my aunt to suicide 4 yrs ago and my husband lost a friend 2 weeks ago in the last 6 years ive attempted to take my own life twice ive seen the black nothing ive felt so desperate for it all to stop and ive felt people would be better off without me i still have my dark days but imhere never ok soldier please please please reach out speak shout scream get heard,0
i dont know you i have no idea who you are but i know one thing youre human sometimes life gets the point you just cant anymore and pain confused maybe hurt thats when you look in the mirror and you see your life is it that bad where you cant anymore or you cant take two steps reach out to help get help? this group is for you we can help you sometimes life gets to that point but i promise you its not worth it,0
wow that was my first thought and the rest of my thoughts revolve around the pain i have been dealing with for more than 20 years (major depression panic attacks anxiety bipolar borderline personality disorder chronic pain suicidal thoughts) i can see how hard it is to lose someone to suicide; i too have lost people it isnt easy on either side if you havent been forced to live with these debilitating diseases/illnesses you cant possibly understand you (& others like you) who call people who commit suicide selfish can you possibly see how you are being selfish?,0
why is it we are in a group based on support and we are focusing on how someone is being selfish for committing suicide? do none of you making that comment realize the mind set the person has to be in already to make that life altering decision they dont currently care about their own existence yet you are expecting their mind to stop and concern with others after they take themselves from the pain and misery they feel currently? that is not the way to talk to someone with severe depression contemplating suicide they need someone to listen someone to talk to and someone to be there they need to feel understood heard and loved and that this will get better or that they are not alone struggling with this do not insist they focus on others issues when they have such drastic mental issues going on in their own mindset that they have difficult contemplating decisions already especially to use words like selfish when you fully clearly dont understand the extend one has to be to be that desperate to make that choice even if you do view it as selfish or not its a misunderstanding on your end not theirs and you are speaking out of being hurt by others actions you didnt fully understand because you couldnt help them,0
deb knapp i have been in that state of mind and it is selfish one who commits suicide may be ending their life and their misery but they are hurting so many people who would have done anything to help if they had only known i was a selfish person but someone said something that struck a nerve for me n snapped me out of it and i got help n i knew that no matter how hopeless life seems some days there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things get better!!! just takes time we r all strong n we can all conquer anything some just need a little help!!!!,0
suicide for those left behind is never ok suicide for those contemplating it is one of the most painful and selfless decisions its never about us it is all about that one person not being able to see straight not being able to see through their emotional distress their broken heart their pleas for help that seem to be falling on deaf ears instead of counting how many we have losthow about counting how many times one has picked up that pill bottle or held that rope?! we and i speak for myself cant look past the next 30 secondsand know that it will be painful but living is not impossible we cant take back and undo once we have died life goes on but without us in it thank you for reaching out to us for trusting people that you dont know i am one of many that you can talk with i only know my own demons but will hear you with all that i have i cant save the world but if you want to talk you will have my undivided attention im sarcastic and sharp tongued but also kind and compassionate you matter xxx,0
andy nicholson i was also mostly responding to someone who said it was "selfish" which i feel is a guilt-tripping word i get what you were saying and by all means remind them of those who do love them or if it is a loved one tell them how much they mean to you tell them why you love them and stuff focus on them and the positive impact they have in peoples lives,0
julie barron this i remember my mother persistently saying it was selfish and id fall further down the rabbit hole my brother on the other hand would say "no heres something you can live for why dont we wait until this moment and then see how you feel then" and his approach was far more helpful than guilt was,0
i was never trying to guilt them out of the thoughts more asking them to think about the people around them everybody has somebody who cares dearly for them even if they dont feel that way,0
parent support group might really help with the stress of parenting and help you enjoy it! also the doc should ask you a lot of questions like are you sleeping are you irritable do you have racing thoughts and how are you doing at making decisions and good judgementssometimes antidepressants make people have mood swings how are your emotions? how is your thinking? are you thinking a lot of a little? are you impossibly fatigues or full of energy? make a list and tell the doctor these things counselling is really helpful one to one if you find someone you are comfortable with!,1
when taking antidepressants and anxiety medications the side effects are hard a person does well on them but gets immune to them after a few years i would try talking to your dr about changing your meds that will help a lot also lavender oil is great to breathe in for anxiety so i hope this helps!!!,1
look into having your meds adjusted try some positive stress relief (music coloring beads gardening) move around & get some sun just got keep trying till you find what helps,1
talk to your pdoc i agree with suggestions that either a new med or dose might be needed if youre not trying other coping skills or in therapy meds can only go so far motherhood is hugely stressful and therapy is necessary for me i have 8 kids 4-26 all with various issues and some with serious diagnoses too i take time for me or i cant stay well daily meditation and a dedicated sleep schedule are critical,1
i hated zoloft though it never did that to me im on whats called an off-label drug meaning the pill is meant for one thing but they noticed in patients it was also helping with anxiety ive been on 100mgs of lamotrigine and very little side effects and no weight gain for sleep (insomnia) i use trazadone its actually for depression and im happy with these,1
what is your dosage on your zoloft ive been on it since 1992 started at 25 now up too 150mg i also take zanex and colozopan for anxiety,1
it`s hard when we hide our symptoms makes it harder for even the best support systems to know they need to intervine (i still do it though) surviving the aftermath: take an honest self assesment accept your acheivements limitations & your ablities build from there don`t stress on what your sickness has caused you`re better now educate people on your symptomatic behaviors & some helpful resposes it can take weeks or months for me to `bounce back` completely keep you`re mind occupid set small goals celebrate every accomplishment (even the tinest baby step!) & be patient with yourself,0
often times a lot of ppl go through that so you are not alone i would seek out a counselor to be able to talk to someone it will help you may have to find one you like best but once u do you will find yourself being able to open up more i get paranoid about things sometimes and think someone is going to say something so i keep my mouth closed but therapy has helped me in the past i wish you the best of luck,0
as far as the before and after i get to the after with my wellness recovery action plan a wrap this is absolutely online and there is an iphone app for it too i keep a bullet journal of tasks but thoughts too and i rate myself 0-10 on anxiety depression psychotic features if i flip back and see my ratings and thoughts getting worse i try to intervene why i am healthy,1
last psychotic episode i took i was hearing things i was convinced the guy upstairs had drilled holes in ceiling and to spy on me and i could see writing appearing on wall i was sat in dark hall way hiding terrified to move for hours until my son came home he knew something was wrong with me but it all seemed very real to me until the hospital explained what was happening i was put on medication to stop hallucinations for a few weeks and opted to go home with a cpn popping in every day for a week to check on me scary stuff at time but with support of my son i got through it x,0
often the people around me have no clue unless my hands get shaky or i am pacing and talking fast at that point they assume i am high on something me being me i let them assume what they may getting pulled over is no fun though these things are misinterpreted as being high or having something to hide well yea im hiding my anxiety as best as i can for my shakiness? i take a benzo this helps to merely slow the physical parts but not the mind as much for the mind i am learning to be more aware of the trigger and not respond so quick to it,1
or in the case of my husband switching during the dayi get tired of being christopher robin sometimes it is hard when i dont know which one im talking to my stress has been pretty high lately we have always been pretty open about his bipolar so i told him he needs to tell me who im talking to so im prepared,0
i get panic attacks,0
im going through the consequences now i know how you feel i seem to push people awayafraid theyre going to leave or give up on me anyway ive learned a lot about myself being a loner though but if its friends you seek have you tried talking to any of them some of them may have been waiting on you to say hello you may have burned a bridge but whats torn down can be rebuilt with time effort patience and love,0
i want to add that my mother had bipolar challenges whereby i couldnt give her support and lived in fear of experiencing her harmful episodes she would think she had started feeling better and therefore stop her medicationsthen downward shed go this was a good teacher: i always take my meds and basically speaking i run fairly balanced (much much better) but still need to pay close attention,0
people are self centers manny dont realise what they have done even i could have hurt some one the problem is i dont know i would like to think i havent but if some one told me i have i would be live then you never know what action can really hurt some one eals and i honestly be live we are all guilty of this in one way or another maybe not intentional,0
they dont realise that they have hurt you and keep doing it but i think that it is my fault too cause of my insecurities ,1
my son is the same i give him benadryl when its bad it works really well for anxiety and puts you to sleep his dr said its fine to use,1
i dont know if theyll prescribe it where you are but i take hydroxyzine at night for my anxiety as it gets pretty bad throughout the night i can also take it during the day as needed,1
my teenage daughter was prescribed celexa and buspar depression and anxiety,1
not ssris because there is an increased risk of suicide in teens when they are on them,0
both my teen boys take prozac and trazadone (antianxiety that also aids in sleep) both boys are asd melatonin caused night terrors after 7 years of no sleep the doctor finally put them these meds quality of life and sleep has improved in the whole house,1
my son is 12 and takes buspar for anxiety you only take it as needed and his doc had no problems prescribing it i want to give you my 2 cents i am definitely not against medication!! i take several and so does my 12 year old but be very very aware of the side effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics!! i see a lot of suggestions in the comments for fairly heavy duty psych meds and i feel you only want to take those as a last resort!! seroquel and remeron so on etc etc are serious meds and i have been on them as an adult and would never put my child on them unless he had actual psychosis! they are both huge weight gainers that effect the metabolism you dont want to start messing with his metabolism so young they also are extremely sedating and not just at night! they can have a big zombie effect! they also mess with the bodies ability to control its core temperature they are also linked to severe oral issues (rotten brittle teeth etc) obviously if you have to have meds then you have to have meds but make sure you study any drug before letting him start taking it,1
does he drink a lot of caffeine? caffeine is a stimulant and will make anxiety worse limit caffeine 4-6 hours before bedtime a body pillow maybe with your moms clothes/ scent on it? i find something solid in bed with me thats comforable helps if its possible or if you havent already tried it a critter like a dog might help make him feel safer in his own room i would be careful with the melatonin though because prolong use will make it less effective im using valarian root right now which is also supposed to help with anxiety chamomile tea is great you could also try st johns wort but as with any medication check to make sure its not going to interfere with anything else if hes taking other meds good luck!,1
my teen takes remeron (mirtazapine) to sleep our pdoc is also reluctant to prescribe anti-anxiety meds or sleep aids and this was a good compromise she has awful nightmares due to ptsd and severe anxiety she also takes prazosin to help with the nightmares we also use the calm app for sleep but otherwise no screen before bed no tv and were careful about caffeine and sugar in a house full of anxious insomniacs were vigilant parents :),1
as an aside my littles (4 9 and 9) dont sleep due to night terrors and anxiety and melatonin and meditation apps are all were doing no doctor here would give them anything else pure parental suffering and no sleep for ten years theyre getting better with time but its been rough i feel for your mom,1
yes teens can be given medication i know in the states doctors do it as young as 2 it is not a bad thing to have to take medication the only downside is addiction to it or even depression that can follow i have severe anxiety and i have been on medication for years i would also seek out something to get his anxiety down while he sleeps its tough being on sleeping medication but with racing thoughts in your head will not go away therapy may also be a good thing to seek out you may want to try that first if it does not succeed then i would look to other alternatives also your mum could go to therapy to talk to someone about how she feels it is not a bad thing at all therapy can change the whole world to a person i wish you and your family the best good luck in finding the right answers because they are out there,1
or you can look up the medicine in the internet and show your mom which will allow her to learn about the medication if it would be helpful for him the side effects and if there are any risks associated with the medication,1
seroquel is an anti-psychotic that helps one relax when it comes to anxiety and fight the paranoia of becoming anxious! i myself am diagnosed with bipolar disorder depression ptsd and anxiety getting out of bed everyday is most of the time a struggle i have been on seroquel for 3 years andyes there have been times where we have to either lower my dose or increase it some but it has worked especially for my insomnia it helps me fall asleep stay asleep and most of the time i wake up feeling refreshed and calm! which is so rewarding!!! yes i am 26 years old but i have a daughter who was prescribed the same medication when she was 9 and it was very effective for her also! plus its not addicting and it doesnt cause you to be dependant on it! there are days that i can go to bed without it and i am fine! plus it might help enough to where it can be a short term medication and he will possibly learn and develop a routine to falling asleep and waking up in his own bed! its worth a shot and i hope it helps!!! ps i live in the usa but maybe since you have been informed of this medication and knowing it is safe for kids and teens with little to no side effects it can be discussed with your brothers dr they both need some relief so maybe if he denies it look into another dr who is willing to try to give your brother the help he needs and your mom the peace and rest she and her both need maybe one who sees that this is a problem in which they are willing to try to help fix and correct! good luck and best wishes from the usa,1
most teens are able to take meds and they are safe for them they dont put them on stuff like xanax because thats short term anxiety relief and can have substance abuse and dependency issues most children and teens with anxiety are put on antidepressants and they are long term and super effective ive been taking antidepressants since i was twelve (im 17 now) and they help a lot you have to figure out which medication works best and doesnt have side effects for him  im on wellbutrin  but there are other types of meds out there hope this helps ,1
has he seen a psychologist for some talk therapy? they can help work out why he is anxious and give him strategies to deal with it medication may help but i would say that most meds havent been tested as safe for kids i do know that ssris made my anxiety worse,1
i dont know who you are we also share very simular illness in our family you are doung exactly the right thing by rwaching out you are obviously very strong tell yourself i am strong tell yourself you love youeself you ars not a burden i oove my sister struggles and all god bless you,0
i agree with the otherssounds like you need emergency intervention  dont be afraid of going to hosp they will help you get stabilized and can refer you to a psychiatrist for regular mental health check ups there is a facebook group called life inside a bipolar mind you can vent and share in group online and someone will understand also google nami they have in person support groups and family education groups as well also you can look at dbsa most importantly do not stop reaching out for helpif you try one avenue and it doesnt work for you keep talking to people until you find some help you can also call 211 and they can let you know about resources in your area there is also a suicide prevention life line 1- 800-273-8255 or look online at: suicide preventionlifelineorg ((((hugs)))),1
bobbi nicole sullivan sorry im kind of a zyprexa fanboy i just think its a really good med with mild side effects but gets a bad rap because of the possible weight gain/diabetes risk i dunno when youve got bipolar disorder schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder pretty much any med theyll give you is gonna suck in some way unfortunately you just gotta figure out which set of side effects sucks the least for you personally i cant handle the creepy-crawly restless limb stuff or tremors ill take the possible weight gain any day of the week but hey maybe ill be changing my tune if the zyprexa gives me diabetes haha,1
call a crisis line asap to get help or call 911 to go to er to the psych ward to get help have done it dont be afraid theyve done lots of help,1
no easy answers - you do whats best for you dont expect them to understand dont care if they do its where self acceptance comes into play and since ive learned it i have blown off some and went to others why ? because i know it comes down to my decision not what others expect or want me to do  i lied with someone for 4 years that wanted me at every little event as they were very outgoing this was 3-5 times a week i literally made myself miserable and "broke down" because i wasnt meeting "their" expectations when i realized i only have to meet my own expectations and gauage them on how i feel i am progressing it has been night and day truly i go to way more things now then ever have before thats not to say its a lot but it is the very important things i also dread them far less and typically enjoy myself athough of course the smaler the get together the better lol ,0
ive applied for a position teaching online after i resigned my position in the classroom bc of my anxiety this job could be good or it could feed my bad habits at least i have to be presentable from the neck up for skype conversations so shower and hair done pants would be optional ,0
i no how you feel i carnt even try to have a bath cuz i panic never mind go out anywhere,0
i hear you & i understand depression & anxiety are so hard because its isolating and people truly cant understand unless theyve been there there are people who understand and who you can reach out to on here though please consider me one of them and dont beat yourself up,0
i overthink all the time i analyze everything sometimes i really believe that when i overthink everything i become my own worst enemy as much as we want to "turn the brain off" it isnt an easy thing to do at all i have tried many times but failed at it i also understand the shower thing last week i hadnt showered or changed my clothes in 9days and that included brushing my hair im not proud of this fact but it happens my own smell finally became too much to handle and i showered the funny thing is after the shower i felt amazing being in the shower felt amazing but the hardest part in those 9days was getting myself to the shower!! depression/bi polar sucks! after 13yrs of marriage i just found out a couple of days ago that my husband is cheating with some woman well its been a few women online and now my marriage is over i dont doubt my depression helped push him to someone else as on my lowest days i must have been so hard to deal with and unless your partner understands depression or has been around it or has a family member suffering from it they have no idea how to handle our highs and lows the mood swings are out of control sometimes and if i can barely cope with how i am feeling how do i expect him or anyone else to understand what it is like?? life is crappy my future is crappy and all men are lying cheating pigs but hey thats life!!!! just because everyone else is hard on you dont be hard on yourself!!! ♥,0
totally understand everyday is a battle i have the same here a party to go to people i dearly want to see invites to dinner all lovely things with lovely people but its a battle just thinking about going let alone actually going do try if you can i try and when people dont understand me i simply say thank goodness i hope they never have to at the moment i have had my medication changed and its sent my head into a turmoil worrying and overthinking them its all these things that are catastrophized by us but are small things to others good luck i hope you can muster up the energy xx,0
i have actually been here and know exactly how you feel keep climbing those mountains i have realized by this point i simply have major limitations i dont even try to force it anymore if the idea of participating is overwhelming i simply dont do it if i forced myself to do things i dont want to i would be majorly triggered saying "no i am sorry i cant" is one of the most empowering phrases ive learned to master ive never had a friend that didnt understand it ❤️,0
i completely understand it took me 2 hours to talk myself into a shower today even though i hadnt showered since friday morning then it took me 6 hours to talk myself into grocery shopping and had a panic attack in the store managed to pull it together to finish then had a panic attack driving home and was drench in sweat and so panicked i couldnt get out of my car right away when i got home  i wouldnt know how to act if i didnt over think everything,0
took me 6 hrs to get to the store today too and then i also had a panic attack while i was there nice to know im not alone,0
go have fun its a great way to combat the anxiety by facing it,1
im the same things are really hard to do i get really anxious about doing them so frustrating x,0
you dont have to go if you dont want todont pressure yourself into a corner if you cant do it  you cant do itmaybe next timeits okits just a partyno big deal if you dont goits okdont force yourself to do things you are not ready forgood luck to yougod bless,0
yesterday i laid in bed crying because our family had its first ever family reunion people flew in from across the country it was at an amazing place close to me at a hotel on the lake all my cousins there who i love and hadnt seen in years and i chickened out and didnt go!!! i was soooo mad at myself i looked forward to it for months my cousin paid for the whole expensive affair and i couldnt even show even with my nearby parents and siblings going who im close to ive missed nearly every holiday in the last year i know there is nothing to feel anxious about and im an extremely confident person!! i also never care what people think of me yet when it comes to family gatherings or friends parties i stay in bed we have a disorder we cannot help it!!! i wasnt overthinking at all yesterday yet i couldnt stop crying to get up & get ready i share this bcuz youre not alone! and dont let anyone make you feel guilty!!,0
i used to feel pretty much the same way (i didnt cry or get sad but i would stress out severely leading up to the event) i finally just starting telling people the truth i dont attend parties where i wont know almost everyone there i do not like crowds i hate being hot so i dont go to picnics or beach parties i really hate when people try to convince me to go: im 48 years old pretty sure i know what i do and dont want to do i hope you get out and do something for yourself that you enjoy,0
yep that was me yesterday feeling guilty too but i finally had to tell myself to stop for one thing im 3 weeks sober (again) this wed im trying hard to stay sober for my well-being but alcohol was always my social crutch!!! i just couldnt go yesterday unless i drank to ease my anxiety so i made the best decision for me and stayed home sober #babysteps,0
i make myself feel guilty when it comes to events with my kidscause they really dont get,0
i hear you for 2 years i had to take an anti-anxiety just to get out of bed because of my illness i had to leave my job,1
yeah my husband said he is running out of excuses for why i dont do the family get togethersi told him to tell the truth i am not ashamed i just want to be the old mei would be happy with half of the old me,0
when i get hypo mania ive get so much energy for days and days i dont sleepi dont eati dont need to  i cant stay still i fidget to much i talk way too fast im super social around other people( i dont have to pretend to be happy  its awsome  )for me the most scariest thing of all is when im coming down from that massive high ( it happens in a split second) then i turn into this furious ball of evil anger the voices and the noise gets so loud in my head that i cant stop them i cant control them they wont shut up then depression comes back and hits 1 million times harder than before its not fun its actually really scary not being able to control myself and not remembering what i have done or said,0
i struggle just to sit still,0
mania is great as hypo mania for the first 1-3 days energy no sleep clean like mad then starts the babbling the irritated rant anger no patience wanting to hit fury!!! breaking anything finally thoughts of suicide this is fun?? i think not,0
i actually love being manic i get lots done i have energy im more open to human interaction i get along with people better its so great for me but i know that eventually im going to crash so hard thats what i hate about it; the constant dread of "when is that next swing going to hit?" the only time i dont like mania is when im in a mixed episode; angry so full of *negative* energy and too depressed to release it safely but its different for everyone i can see why some people would dislike it,0
restless pacing relentless plan making ruminating insomnia re-hashing and compulsive impulse driven not a fun thing at all,0
true that mania is often times looked at as being high high typically conjures up thoughts of enjoyment its fun and exciting when its ramping up but the fun goes away fairly quickly the excitement stays but not its not a good excitement feelings of invincibility delusions overinflated sense of self irritability reckless behavior and a really short fuse for those who dare get in the way of the goings on in our life our life being the things we are doing when manic taking over the world building rockets to fly to space figuring out the equation for time travel and in our spare time submit to an overindulgence in anything we love doing did i mention reckless behavior? if not add reckless behavior to the list before i forget reckless behavior thats just the euphoric mania then comes the shame and guilt of the loss of impulse control overcommitting ourselves to friends family employers and customers burning through cash paying for our overindulgence and the frustration of having to get caught up on the things that really matter which of course by the time we have our mental faculties restored are left completely exhausted and have no energy to do any of it mania is a dangerous condition then there is dysphoric maniaim not even going to start that one most of my manic episodes are dysphoric lets just say that dysphoric mania is extremely destructive,0
my mania is angry mania its awfulout of control anger at everyone and everything its better now that im on meds but its horrid when it happens its embarrassingits scary for my familyoh the fun of bipolarits just grand,1
and its not the same as anxiety!,1
yeah i love the part where im so high and i believe god has given me a special power and i feel amazingly in touch with everything however when my body cant keep up with my brain anymore and i start to get close to falling then i really get aggravated and anxious,0
im in that mode at the moment!!! its so scary!!!,0
i get hypomania but i dread to think how life would be with mania :(,0
this is how i used to feel! i thank god that these horrible times are shorter now i believe growing older and having more insight into my bi-polar disorder and my severe anxiety and depression has helped me immensely as well as living with a very kind supportive individual who believes in me!,1
feeling right now to the point my oldest yelled at me "i hate you youre not my mom and you never were" i wish i could explain the uncontrollable thoughts in my head why i cry b/c they hurt explain why i need space before i do worst how to explain to a 7yo(almost 8) didnt even want to leave home to go to work but im here now and i dont want to do anything but cry,0
reach out only if sincere our paranoia lets us see through bullshit,0
going through a shitty day and afraid to say it to my friends was out but it didnt do much good,0
iback in the 90s i was put on benzos to help anxiety and i became addicted over years of use they did mostly help but they made me so tired all the time i couldnt perform my daily duties at home or elsewhere i was taught different breathing techniques and sometimes it worked but sometimes it didnt sometimes a "good" distraction helps calm a person down its been over 20 years now and its definitely improved most days its differant for every person who deals with this just try to do the best you can no one in your life should be asking for anything more out of you than trying to do your best!,1
yeah u just wish anxiety would go away but what doesnt help is what causing it wont go asay,1
yeah u just wish anxiety would go away but what doesnt help is what causing it wont go asay,1
sometimes it is a big voice using all your insecurities against you,1
being the mother watching is horrible too no matter who its is it isnt a picnic for sure,0
i take welbuterin for depression and anxiety and nortryptaline for sleep lost some weight from welbuterin,1
every antidepressant ive tried ive always gained weight on unfortunately its a site effect on most of the tablets they give you im no longer on medication as nothing works and now struggling to loose the 2 stone ive gained since being on bloody meds,0
this is all interesting i worked for years with people with mental health issues and realized i have them myself it really is easier to help other people than face those issues within ones self i took meds for bi polar got fat then stopped drank and got fatter stopped drinking as well i am into my 5th year now i started taking melatonin to sleep  high blood pressure pills and water pills now i have to work on my weight and get it back down the hard part is getting a mind set to set up a better routine  eat better and exercise morei know with the clients i used to work with keeping ongoing records was a valuable tool because you can see the results and work on routinepeople do much better with routines and organized homes clutter makes people nuts i know this because i lived with the people i worked with 7 days on 7 days off  i and my alternates worked well together keeping things organized and schedules everyone went to bed by 10 and up between 6 or 7 depending on client abilities,1
i take effexor and klonipin and have for a long time i was able to get the weight issues evened out after about 6 months and truly dont think it affects me much anymore its been over a decade since i started with them just fyi drinking with benzodiazepines can be dangerous and withdrawal from alcohol and benzos are both very dangerous and usually need to detox medically alcohol withdrawal is often treated with benzos to decrease risk of seizures so please be careful,0
yes! i am almost 3 weeks sober (again) technically ive been diagnosed with bipolar and general anxiety i had horrible pms theyve had me on different cocktails of about 12 mental health drugs at the same time i stopped drinking a couple weeks ago i stopped all my meds except 20 mg celexa (i was on 40) and xanax as needed im trying to see what happens without all the drugs i felt mood stabilizers made me worse and i feel alcohol is my worst trigger good luck!!,1
im a recovering alcahol i take mirtazapine for depression and propranol for anxiety i went through rehab and took baclofen for over a year to stop cravings and anxiety which really helped and anti abuse to stop me drinking talk or ask to see a cpni reffered myself through the alcahol and addictions team on nhs hope this helps x,1
yeah so idk about meds but i know i like taking ashwaghanda root for depression and valerian root as a sedative and a sleep aid also thc free cbd oil as well for anxiety,1
i agree with jennifer tenhagen a therapist does not diagnose however the worst thing anyone who suffers from a mental illness or any form of illness have the tendency to look it all up that plays tricks with your mind the best way to bring it up is to see a psychiatrist and do all the tests when you finish them then they can give you the correct diagnosis you may have anxiety and not adhd thats why a doctor needs to diagnose you i hope you the best i was diagnosed in 2005,1
what jennifer tenhagen has posted is very accurate so please take note of her advice as many people get confused your therapist has treated you very appropriately as only a psychiatrist can or should diagnose any medical disorder a therapist plays a very different yet valuable role,1
i use to have all these feelings like everybody else i am reading these posts and i travel back in my mind to feeling this way for so many years i have been slowly getting my old self back my old life before i was over medicated and living in board and care homes and constantly going in and out of psych hospitals i would pray and dream for my life back my dream is coming true and i have been more than stable for 5 years yes i have struggles but i am stronger now mentally please believe it when i say there is hope and i am proof,0
but i never feel happy i live in brokenhome so i get confused with "i want to be happy again" or "i want to be the old me",0
the struggle is real !!,0
i wake every morning with anxiety wondering how im going to cope with my day thats what gets to me,0
i just read that lithium has been approved for pregnancies the risks to the fetuss heart are not what they thought,0
talk to your doctor about what the risks are as this is your baby and you want the best,0
i was on 40mg prozac and 05 mg rispedol when i was pregnant my anxiety was horrible pm me if you have any questions,1
you should release your anxiety because it sounds like your thoughts are racing scrubcleanbench press sprint run get aggression out and get that air in your lungs feel life! your worth something your not worthless we can do it you can make it just push till tomorrow and keep pushing,0
this makes perfect sense to me the things that should be okay things ive experienced a hundred times without harm still create utter panic,0
brendan fry cause u overplayed disturbeds version,1
ive been on both i found them very much the same in terms of anxiety control they helped to stabilise my mood somewhat but neither one were great i found the seroquel made me super drowsy to the point that i was a useless lump of a human being with no drive to do anything however my partner is on seroquel and hes had no side effects and its helping him a lot the zyprexa made my appetite insatiable and my metabolism stopped so i gained 15kgs in 3 months i have now been put on ziprasidone and its a life saver i have found its the best medication i could go on i havent had any side effects from it in the 6 months ive been on it but everyone is different and medication is trial and error,1
seroquel helped me so much with my anxiety its the only thing that ever helped me get off benzos as well it has most definitely saved my life,1
yeah i mean i was on it years before this but i had the xr version and i think its better if you have that one but the regular seroquel is scary! gave me panic attacks! and dude thats really scary im sorry that happened to you glad your mom was there to help!,0
get off the seroquel while you can horrible drug,0
i use seroquel as a sedative cause i have sleeping issues (insomnia) and i have lexapro (an antidepressant) to counter act the depressive side effect of seroquel and to help me w my anxiety and depression it works fine w me i take 150mgs every night 9:30pm and id be asleep by 11 i used to take only 50mgs and it kinda makes u immune to the sleeping effect so my dosage got higher haha hope this helps also seroquel made me lose a lot of weight idk why,1
also seroquel relaxes me when i have anxiety attacks :) it rly help me calm down,1
i gained a huge amount of weight i was tired all the time and had terrible nightmares and night terrors so thankful to be off it!,0
i have gained a ton of weight but the benefits out weigh my weight currently i am on 300 but i have on as much as 600 whitch makes really tired and unable to function it takes away my nightmares and night terrors!,1
my husband takes serequel for anxiety but he also has schizo-effective disorder,1
and they are very dangerous when coming off benzodiazepines one should really do a medical detox for risk of seizures most put one on phenobarbitol for it,0
really? my husband takes 25 mg (not much i guess) so that makes me nervous,1
both of these medications can cause anxiety and depression they are very strong antipsychotic drugs using them for anxiety is comparable to using heroin for a headache anxiety can be tamed with a class of meds from benzodiazepines or even antihistamines you may also find relief from cognative behaivor learning triggers and coping skills with out medication we must all be careful of how medications are used and perscribed to us,1
same here thora have been on 100mg of zoloft for just over a year (up from 50mg since september 2011) - i take it for both mdd and social anxiety though more so for the anxiety these days its been a lifesaver,1
perhaps both are true maybe your memory has been altered due to time and the deep emotions that go with something like this and they also dont want all you say to be true because its shameful and it hurts the truth is likely somewhere in the middle i think in making peace if you took the position that you were a child and some of the memories could be a little skewed however insisting that nevertheless it has certainly contributed to your current state this might be a better place to start reconciliation anywaythats my two centsgod bless you,0
o how i can relate!! i too went threw this same exact scenario! watch my alcoholic step dad beat my mom when i was a small child! till this day im told its untruei know what i saw!! ive always been told anything that i remember as a child its just my imagination!! its horrible to think the one person in life that birthed you tells you ur pretty much delusional! ive learned to detach myself from my upbringing for i thought and was made to feel it was all a lie! hope you find peace with it!,0
i can relate and this memory issue is not uncommon perhaps you would do better to focus on storing those memories somewhere where they can no longer effect you or confuse you 20yrs is such a long time to be dealing with this maybe put all that negative energy that will juzt keep you sick into letting it go this enabled me to move forward & focus on my day to day health & well-being,0
brian castaneda i am so proud of everything youve done thats brought you to where you are today you deserve recognition for your struggles hardships and successes in that,0
please get help hon there is no shame in seeking help i agree stay away from judgemental people and those that know nothing about mental illness,1
i went to a center for mental health and substance abuse (place for either or both issues) which was the real beginning of getting myself under control they have counselors who i found were non judgmental not pushy and there for you to talk anytime they have a huge range of resources and support all types group meeting with people dealing with similar issues they help you to understand yourself more and come up with solutions that are right for you its always a good idea to talk to your doctor or a psychiatrist but i found the mental health center to be the best support you are in control its all about trying new things a good try keep whats good pass on whats not for you you can do it! i know its overwhelming and its hard to get a ball rolling but it will get better and you will enjoy life as you find yourself more❤,0
i know exactly how you feel im the same and dont bother at times talking to anyone including my partner i dont think people realize its just a struggle to even get out of bed sometimes i dont think you should drop your partner try and sit down and tell him exactly how you feel if he loves you he will do some research or buy a book to understand the illness avoid the judgemental unknowledgeable people see if there are group out there who has the same illness as u so they can relate to how you are feeling these people understand so good for your soul seek professional help to see if u are on the right meds avoid negativity in general or zone out if u cant avoid them,0
i decided to be open about my bipolar disorder and some remain wary but i do not carei will not shrink from this i am not embarrassed and by being open i believe im making a small contribution to the understanding of it,1
"""im not feeling very well"" = ""im struggling with my anxiety/depression/ptsd today"" everyone thinks i have a stomach bug or some shit :-/",0
i understand sometimes what is said or posted isnt helpful if you have a diagnosis please dont be ashamed as i was god makes us and gives us things to make us stronger if you are on meds take them faithfully maybe this is your test in trust and faith,0
this is regressive towards mental health people like myself didnt choose to have this illness; and not all misery needs company sometimes company needs misery,0
i dont like to call it a darkness personallyjust a place of indecision for me,0
i was on abilify for a mood stabilizer i was on zoloft for anti depressant and klonopin for anxiety im bipolar ll all during my pregnancy and my son is perfectly healthy i went to massachusetts general hospital in boston ma for advice on what to take that would be safe for baby,1
this would drive me crazy it would make my anxiety worse!!!,1
that would just make my anxiety worse i hate any type of restrainment,1
i suffer from bad anxiety this would be great! questions where can you find them? and are they too heavy in the heat?,1
6 hours sometimes isnt enough when my anxiety starts i will not leave the house :(,1
i have to go somewhere tmrw and im already feeling anxious,0
if i was healthy and didnt have ties here i would move in a heartbeat i dont share the same ideals as our "president" nor do i believe stripping the health insurance from 23 million of americas most vulnerable citizens to give americas most wealthy a giant tax break is in the least bit humane or acceptable it would be more humane to line the sick and elderly up against the wall and shoot them,0
sylvester is looking a bit stressed out! lol,1
i doubt anyone is happy shes is gone and they wouldnt be if you were they are all just trying to cope with their own grief if they can justify her death by saying that she no longer suffers it can help dull the pain and confusion they feel inside,0
im not confused that i love youhehehethanks yo,0
failure and fear are my problems,0
brenda benefield thank you that was advice from the doctors anxiety turned into excruciating muscle spasms and seizure-like episodes that lasts for hours medication and therapy is a necessity also but you have to help yourself find out about all the symptoms of manic dep so you can win some battles you will never win the big war but accept the battles that you win as something learned ive written research papers and helped therapists on ways to come up out of depression if youre interested it will work for you god be with all of you hugs to all,1
for me the last thing i need is some made up bull shit about how god loves me and "we cant go on w/o you" its the misconstrued lies that make me fall further away this mental cage is a burden we place upon ourselves is a spiral spun the fuck out if you love this person and im guessing you do spend quality time make them feel they matter this hole is deep contemplation overwhelms us to the point of oblivion sometimes the best answer is silence along with companionship along with a smile this monkey is a bitch dude,0
bobbi nicole sullivan from my perspective yes maam drives me into a pit that i cant climb fast enough to get away from depression and anxiety go hand in hand with each other for me anyway,1
bobbi nicole sullivan yes all this for anxiety too much or too little for you?,1
jesse is correct on the crippling effect anxiety can have a lot of times the simplest gestures to show you care are the ones that help the most,1
bobbi every person is different with different needs sometimes anxiety (and/or depression) can stop me from really doing anything for myself social anxiety may not want to leave the house so it can be helpful to have a support network of close friends etc to help out if it gets so bad,1
yeah if you wanna get pregnantthatll sure change tomorrow no doubt,1
oh dear i am quite guilty of this - just have to spit it out or will forget it!!,0
yep i mean and yes dont worry i am/have rapid cycling bipolar 2 and do exactly the same so both ends of the spectrum covered ,1
im guilty,0
so true!! people who dont have a mental disorder have no idea what we go through to just try to fit in especially at work you get treated like your an enigma always getting in trouble for having a sad or upset face people tell you that your rude etc if they could just understand that i cant stop it they say just dont react keep a smile on your face be nice to those that are rude to you remember that the client is the reason that were here ok well ive already explained my illness the symptoms the reactions i have etc and now your telling me to just get over it and act normal??? well "f" you ! to all the people out there that think we are just wanting attention sympathy special treatment etc if i had a wish and i could wish anything i wanted i would wish that all of you doubters and non-believers out there could feel what we do everyday 24/7 then tell me what you think of me!,0
so many stories about depression and anxiety no one says what to do to get better ,1
what should i do i feel like there is nothing that would make me happy anymore i dont care about anything anymore nothing excites me i have no motivation the only reason i dont sleep all my life is because i have uncomfortable pillows which i am afraid to change them with comfortable ones i feel so drained and emptyplease anybody tell me something a new perspective a reason to live to breath! i want to cry but i cont even see point in doing that,0
gevork yot you are not alone in your struggle,0
weed helps reduces anxiety relaxingincrease in appetite the right kind can help you get motivated,1
have a look at mindfulness on the net there are even apps for your phone it has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety and full blown panic attacks,1
absolutely true for me i hate it if had just one wish it would be to take my anxiety away,1
this could not be more true!!! i hate having anxiety and being in a constant battle with my brain in every choice i make!!! but i am focusing on controlling it and learning my triggers along with handling with depression and bipolar disorder! i dont ask for a pity party cause i am fine!!! i have an awesome support system w beautiful healthy little girls and a husband who loves me despite the struggles he faces learning to cope with my anxiety/depression/bipolar disorder and hes learning a lot about symptoms and understanding what each thing does to me and how it affects my daily life! he is my rock and i couldnt be more thankful for him standing by me through it all!!!! hes the real mvp!!!,1
paranoia has become one of my senses having been paranoid all my life shit even with medication it doesnt even slow down,0
own it dont let it own you i know its hard because i struggle also but dont let it run your life,0
i wish i only had anxiety,1
if they only knew what really goes on in ones mind!! everyday i struggle!!,0
you just wrote what so many people have gone through my son age 34 has been struggling all his life it is heart breaking to see him struggle every day of his life he is my hero but i hate the ignorance of so many people that just dont get it and shame him or his dad and i he knows his disease well and is a good advocate for himself even though i go with him to all doctor appts he has learned on his own some wonderful coping skills that help us all out when he is angry for no apparent reason he will hold his hand up like stop we then know not to disturb him or talk to him until he comes back to us and starts talking i am so very proud of him and all the people that fight the battle every day god speed,0
yea i guess it stems from paranoia and anxiety thats how i feel with myself im very suscpious of everyone around me for some odd reason,0
latuda caused me to get akithesia (severe restlessness to the point i couldnt stand sit or lie down for even a few minutes at a time) and i tried it twice as it had started to help my moods going on 2+ years and still cant find a med to stabilize my bipolar,1
latuda was horrible for me and listen to your body how you feel only you know,0
latuda had a terrible effect on me i felt shaky but like a zombie at the same time almost like a bouncy ball stuck in a glass cup i couldnt function or let alone drive on it everyone reacts differently though id say try it out for a few weeks if you can and then talk to your doctor i have found that the first few weeks of taking a new medication has always been difficult because of the initial side effects,0
trintellix causes seizures the side affects are horrible my psychiatrist prescribed it for me but i didnt take it ive toughed it out for 3 weeks go back next week but im also on another med for my bi polar,1
i just message this page privately and still awaiting a reply im honestly stuck and confused i need immediate help (that is-- if abuse is an emergency),0
latuda kept me from sleeping and caused my blood sugar to go highone of the side effects of latuda is restlessness,1
latuda was bad for me zombie weight gain threw up if i didnt take it precisely a half hour after eating paranoia and a general just wrong and off feeling it put me to sleep like the dead within minutes and i was so tired all day i couldnt even stay awake,1
latuda gave me horrible sides different for everyone was the worst for me of all meds ive tried,1
been on 40 mg for about a year i really didnt notice a difference i was hoping it would help but make sure you take it after you eat because with me it can upset the stomach pretty bad and i was told it doesnt even work unless you take it with at least 300 calories,1
latuda the next morning i saw/felt the walls moving when i laid in my moms bed and started at the ceiling super scary to see walls of a house shape shifting etc never took it again,0
i have a lot of issues with side effects and latuda has been one of the few ive been lucky with and i feel it has helped me my moods are not as out of control as they were and it helped a lot with bipolar depression i take it with my dinner each night to avoid stomach upset and im fine,1
i took latuda but i had a bad side effect to it i became like a zombie i would shake and just zone out its called ackaethesia (sp),1
ohhhhh! beautifultalented funny robin so sadly badly missed from our world so clever you were at wearing the happy mask i can so totally relate on all levels  such a wickedly horrid thing is depressionanxiety and such  and sadly for robin a fight that he could no longer endure will never ever be forgotten for the happy he gave our souls ❤,1
so sad no one could save him he probably had no one he could talk to about his illness for fear of being labeled as a stigma in society god is the only one that can judge us were not suppose to judge others lest ye be judged thy self,0
true story! your body feels so heavy and when your stressed out it gets worse and worse until you can hardly stand it! ;(,0
my husband always ask me why im so tired all time time why do u need to nap everyday or go to bed by 8? only if we could switch bodies and minds for a day so the unknowing ones could then understand what depression anxiety the panic attacks so bad u have to pull over for are all about not to mention having social anxiety and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder ughhh,0
thats how i feel when i sleep i dont feel the anxiety and panic attacks i just cant get enough sleep sometime completely no energy specially with the meds i take make me have no energy exercise help when i force myself its hard and depressing,1
this is me right now struggling a lot and my only respite is sleep ,1
yes ive hidden my anxiety and depression for years i never talked about it i suffered in silence and felt so alone i dont apologise for it anyway more,0
people jus make one guilty n feel 100 times worse,0
the only way it worked with my husband is him educating himself on the disorder before me he had no idea what was bpd he needs to have patience and to respect your space and you respect his space we can be overwhelming sometimes and for someone that doesnt have a disorder can be pretty hard to understand good luck xox,0
maybe have this person read about your disorders and explain an every day situation so they have examples tell them how you are when youre upset (like saying things you dont mean waiting for a reaction maybe punching a wall) and give them a little advice on how they can help in the situation and the easiest way to prevent a problem in the future between you two,0
so the cool thing is that you can listen to the birds in the morning without rushing off to work im afraid thats all i got for positive anything,0
unfortunately yes it is a struggle every day to get myself to believe i am worthy and doing ok and this is on my meds before i found this combo of drugs i felt exactly the same as you  and it doesnt matter how many people tell me i am special i hate myself and the last time i was sick i had to quit a job i had worked hard to get and had worked towards for over 10 years  which now i regret and wish i had been able to cope and be normal then so i could keep working there now i dont have a job we barely scrape by and i feel so guilty that my illness caused this anyway so sorry you are feeling this way i understand completely where you are coming from so i am not going to tell you to buck up as i know you cant  i am just going to say i understand and i care <3,0
yes i do been trying for 6 yrs to shake the horrible feelings i have about myself need a new dr,0
i feel the same when my anxiety sets in and i cant do anything like cleaning the house i feel like a failure because i am not able to do all the things "normal"people do,0
yeah i feel that way everyday i avoid mirrors and cameras because they always seem to see the sad part of me i hate not feeling normal and it seems like no one understands that and when i teach out for help because i feel like im having s mental breakdown in told i cant have one because i have a family that needs mebut how do you stop it?,0
i have had bipolar one for 13 years and adhd for44 years im now 50 years young i too struggle with self hate i have never been normal and ive been bullied all threw my school i often get really down just thinking that i will have these disease s for the rest of my life but then i try to b positive and just take one day st a time hang in there these bad feelings dont last forever ,0
do you have a psychiatrist? as far as i know only they can give you the diagnosis i too had childhood anxiety however i also have borderline personalitybut once i went to college i was pretty sure that i had bi-polar i took my concerns to a psychiatrist and within our first appointment and a series of questions i met the criteria lynn is righti have had long periods of depression as well as mania i also rapid cycle often some days my mood can change in a snap but do get your gp refer you to a psychiatrist i wish you luck,1
im here for you to talk to anytime its scary i know,0
hi i have the same thing and the same thoughts i broke down and tried to kill myself with my dads gun before getting help i was admitted to impatient ward and was there for 4 days after getting out i did a out patient for 4 weeks it changed my life ive never been so happy if you know you need help dont wait just go your gut is always right go and get help,0
when im stressed out and things are going well i take a day off and do nothing i take a hot bath i watch a good movie eat a good meal my favorite food suites or whatever it is and i dont think about anything and just relax and sleep maybe thats what you need to do is just relax take a couple deep breath and enjoy your day,0
that is a lot to go through in a short period of time certainly you have went through a lot of emotional trauma as well as abandoment issues i would be quite hesitant if a doctor diagnosed some one at the age with a bipolar or even many other mental illness the reason is because for one puberty certainly had not hit at that young of an age other reasons would be that we learn emotional reactions from our environment which in turn means we can learn better coping skills by no means am i saying there is nothing wrong simply that it is worth looking at things from a different angle,1
nobody even wants to try and understand my work is especially closed and cold hearted with those of us that have illnesses and arent a part of their click they ignore me and treat me as an obstacle they have to constantly avoid,0
there was one person in the whole world my friend trusted he mocked her called her unmentionable names called her stupid you name it i had to talk to her for three hours to convince her not to leave this world so please anxiety and bipolar is no joke they didnt ask to be born with it,0
thank you for saying that i feel so helpless for my friend she is a beautiful person and so broken right now calling someone nasty names and being heartless when there confused scared and feeling lost is not ok,0
you need to involve your mom in your treatment my mom/family didnt get it until i took took them to family counseling and to group counseling specifically for families dealing with someone with my disorder you cant be upset if they truly know nothing about whats going on if they knew then they could see how great youre doing,0
i totally understand! no one will understand mental illness because it scares the shit out of them for me i am always remembered for all the mistakes i made or for one sister doesnt believe in my diagnosis she also resented my going on disability my brother has a wife who cant stand me and he thought that every time i called him i was trying to ask him to bail me out again things i did before i got diagnosed and got on medication but he still judges me and sees me as that other person he was the one person who i thought would start to understand bpd because he got reading material i suggested but it didnt matter my whole family and history is pretty crazy ya know? so after my first suicide attempt i thought that i had really burnt some bridges the only one that has been there through it all has been my sister nancy i cannot tell you how much we have grown i made a decision to move away from my family so that i could learn to stand on my own two feet while it has been a bumpy ride it has been the right thing to do i have a companion in my life who i am learning to love freely and in turn learning to love myself my advice to you try to find your own way in the world and people who will love you exactly as you are your family is never going to change so except it and move on you are an amazing person for the journey and the obstacles you have overcome! start to separate from your family there is a world out there that is so amazingly beautiful you just have to take that step!,0
i wad the drug addict and the one with mental health problems and with both i was told that i was trying to get even with my dad for leaving us when we were younger that i just wanted attention that there was nothing wrong with me other than trying to get my way its all because mental health scares people in my opinion they dont understand it so they blame the person wroth the disease,0
my mum told me im an embarrassment and no one in the family wants to be around me fuck em,0
you are amazing your struggle is real and you have come far!! i kno its not the same but i wanted you to hear it at least once tonight ive been were you are as far as not getting the credit for the work youve done just to survive i was a cutter as a teen and i relapsed when i was like 20 and when my mom found out she told me i was doing it to hurt her even tho i was tring to hide it when your mom goes off on how well your sibling is doing walk in the bathroom put the phone down for just a second put your hands on your hips and hold your head high looking in the mirror and say "im a f***king super hero" and kno that you are! and pick the phone back up,0
you can still love and support someone without having to be with them if thats what you choose to do but i think at this point it would be too sudden to get back together with him him proposing to get back with you is a huge red flag to me that hes desperate to get you- a stable factor- back in his life whatever it takes to do that sweetheart tred carefully promises are nice but your mental health comes first before his and divorce is expensive,0
if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly you dont need stress wish you all the best get well,0
if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly you dont need stress wish you all the best get well,0
honestly move on without him he may be on a high right now probably on his meds but has it been long enough to be very sure he will remain on his meds? will he spiral out of control and hurt you yet again? all these doubts all these question can you honestly tell yourself to ignore your own conscious? first and foremost your children are against any relationship with him because they suffered right along with you after he broke your heart and then tried to kill himself can you truly say his love has more worth than your peace of mind or the peace of mind of your children? i personally would place the wellness of my children and myself before any man no matter how much i love him please think things through before making any decisions you may regret in the long run many blessings to you and yours,0
since you have not invested a lifetime as i have and your children and you equally agree that this is relationship on a downward spiral i would back out without any further attachments sounds like he has gotten help and its his decision to continue it is your own decision to take care of you the best you can guilt free you have to or you yourself will end up not being able to function continued treatment and support is the key though,1
run dont walk the other way you have children he isnt stable yet and the stress of a regular relationship is hard on someone stable yet alone someone so fresh out of a trauma plus youve already said you found a good guy follow your head hes just trying to fill a void,0
i really wish that the guy i fell in love with that would rather be scared of the stigma around bipolar that he just left me,0
when she gets like that shes got so much in her head its hard for her to comunicatebelieve me its very distressin for herbut be strong she does love u x,0
let her ignore you and dont take it personally maintain your own hobbies and such too -- these struggles can consume people around us too you stay healthy and look after yourself too support by being stable and steady and just wait fir when she is able to re-engage,0
i feel the way he does!!! always afraid of losing my man no matter how much he assures me im not going to the best thing is to just let him know always that your here you love him and your not leaving its frustrating cause you know your not gonna leave him but hes feeling alone cause he knows no one and hes in a new place it will take time but stick with it hell come around in time however youve gotta give him that time here if you need any advice,0
im really sorry and wish i could do more to help  i was reading through the comments amd saw alot commenting about bipolar? i have very similar situations with suddenly getting really depressed and sometimes it even goes to serious anger and irritation in secondsdoes that mean i could be bipolar?,0
possibly bipolarisms best known symptom is rapid mood swings with little to no warning or reason it would be best to speak with a doctor if you suspect there could be an issue i have a mild form that coexists with depression and anxiety i dont experience the highs (mania) but i do have depressive episodes that come on suddenly with no trigger and they disappear in much the same way,1
i find it really hard to work with other humans lol tried to get back in to the work place but peoples attitudes and boundaries made my mh worse so i now volunteer from home for an animal rescue far less pressure and the freedom to have bad days without losing wages or feeling bad when needing time out,0
i work at home frequently but although i find the office environment really stressful and on occasion detrimental to my mh i wouldnt want to work at home everyday as i know myself and i wouldnt see anyone,1
i use nexium and sifrol sifrol is a godsend for the restlessness and apparently the magnesium in the nexium would be helping too the nexium was originally prescribed for heartburn tho best of luck hun x,1
in addition to the requip for restless legs at bedtime i take 3 capsules of l-tryptophan i also take gaba to calm & relax me usually i take it with my l-tryptophan before bed however anytime i can take the gaba instead of my xanax i do your body produces gaba but some people benefit from also taking a gaba supplement it has no chance of addiction and its easier on your body i buy these 2 supplements from "thorne research" you can find them online their magnesium is superior to any i have taken hope this helps,1
i take requip for my restless legs have been taking it for 8 years magnesium has also been proven to work in some cases,1
i get restless legs every now and then i drink tonic water to combat it apparently quinine helps,1
i had restless leg taking zoloftim on a different mednow,1
eat a banana a day it helped me a lot with restless legs,1
yes!!! every medication ive tried bar my anxiety meds have causes restless legs trying taking some magnesium and request a blood test,1
do you feel and internal restlessness as well? akathesia perhaps?,0
on effexor for many years side effect restless legs nothing helped except paxola,1
klonopin should certainly ease any restlessness certainly have some blood work done to check potassium levels and magnesium levels,1
try the magnesiun oil spray its brilliants for pain and restless legs,1
magnesium helped me heaps with restless legs,1
i hate my depression and anxiety even now weve still got tories and dup government,1
it may not be possible to completely stop anxiety but there are things you can do to manage it before it escalates there are excercises you can use i think they are part of cbt mindfulness where you work through a situation going through how you are perceiving it and what the reality if sutuation is its something that you have to continually work at you might always be anxious but there are ways to cope with it better,1
listen to u tube meditation videos on anxiety and relaxing the mind  works great for me,1
i suffered from serious panic attacks and was diagnosed with panic disorder i learned that my neck injury was actually the cause if your atlas bone (top vertebra in your neck) is out of alignment it causes the interference of your bodys ability to properly function such as improper flow of cerebral fluid it basically causes your brain to not be able to flush properly and is deprived of the proper flow of fluid my neck has been holding correct alignment now for three months and i have not had a panic attack the entire time where i used to have them all the time if you would like any more info you can pm me :-),1
that is part of anxiety and depression we always over analize and we let get to us because we hold it in til we finally blow also things that seem small to others is a bigger deal to us because our coping skills have changed and things just will happen just take a deep breath and do one day at a time!,1
i had a lot of help with taking turmeric with black pepper that being said i also had some help talking about my anxiety with someone i have gotten so worked up at my job that im having physical problems now mostly lower gi tract i wont get graphic or explain anymore luckily i have a wife who understands and is supportive i hope you are able to find someone,1
its terrible hey i have general anxiety i wake up  theres anxiety flowing through my body anxious about going to the store to being anxious that someone peed on the toilet seat i almost lose my mind,1
unfortunately i was extremely violently sick when taking theseevery time i took one id feel faint and be sickthen every time i missed it i would be sick tooso couldnt winhorrible drugworth a try though because everyone else says differently,0
i was on fluoxotine for 24 years and never felt nauseous i did get restless leg syndrome at night and hot flushes they helped alot to start with but eventually they stopped working for me i went from 20 mg a day to 80mg before changing doctors to one who agreed to send me to hospital to see a phyciatrist before being allowed to be weaned off them and changed to something more suitable x,1
i have had nausea as a side effect for many meds but i have never acruelly thrown up from them you may feel uncomfortable but actually vomiting is pretty rare as far as i know your results may vary but after trying 20 or so different meds i never had one make me throw up good luck and i wish youthe best,1
i know the long list of side effects is very scary i have been on meds for 27 years fluoxetine is one of my meds it really is excellentfor me my psychiatrist and i have worked hard on getting the right dosages and meds things are much better but as frustrating and scary it is to have to take medication;your quality of life will truly be better,1
i use purata and it really helps i drink a 15 mg an hour before i go anywhere where i might have an anxiety attack and use a 30 mg at night,1
you are the first person i have everheard of besides myself with this fear you won`t know how the meds affect you till you try it did insert suggest take with food or on an empty stomach? can you ask dr or pharmasist for suggestions? do you have someone who can sit with you till you know it won`t do you that way? i wish i had more help instead of just questions it sucks i know but you can`t know till you try it maybe some music or a walk for distraction in stead of sitting around dreading it? idk but i feel ya,0
i think its definitely worth a try with medication unfortunately its a bit of trial and error until you find the right one for you and the correct dose as they can vary but i was told today by a doctor for somebody else that that medication can help with anxiety so i guess your gp would have taken your situation into account when prescribing them acute anxiety can start at a very young age and can then lead to other things if not addressed hopefully you are making great strides in trying to get help to overcome this awful condition it can be terrible at times however taking medication isnt always easy for some people so completely understand the things you ve said really well done for seeking help best wishes x,1
you must try xx you will probably suffer and then you might not xx take the risk and let us know how you get on xx we all love you either way you have been strong xxxxxxxx,0
it can be so hard sometimes when each partner has a mental health condition as you are in the us (im in uk) im unsure what professional support you have access to ive read lots of posts from people in the us and usually no mention is made of any support they are receiving so it might be that the only help available is therapy which you have to pay for supporting someone else with a mental health problem can be exhausting in itself and if you are suffering too then it can be twice as hard im sure on one of your good days it is far easier and it can be very rewarding and therapeutic for you i often thought that while i was helping others i wasnt focussing on myself which was a good thing as mental illness can seem very self centred sometimes which can be pretty hard to deal with im sure you are a wonderful support to your boyfriend and you appear to be really helping him move forward and gain the strength necessary to socialise and make new friends im sure it is sometimes very tiring for you hopefully with every good positive experience your boyfriend has this will help him learn to manage and hopefully eventually cope better with his anxiety which sometimes it can be crippling id like to think as he learns to move forward this would help you too sometimes when we are struggling ourselves we dont always have the energy to effectively support someone else too when we need all our strength for self preservation to look after yourself you ideally need help do you have family or friends you can lean on? theres no easy answer unfortunately recovery from both isnt easy it takes a lot of strength and determination some days we have those some we dont it can seem a huge mountain to climb sometimes but small steps are the key small but significant goals are important you are doing a wonderful job by the sounds of things but try to get help and take care x,0
just reassure him i have the same problem and have to be reassured constantly its exhausting in my logical mind i know im being irrational but in my anxiety mind i think im being left,0
a nigtmareof false guilt,0
right on point you start doubting your sanity,1
im upset and oversensitive im an empath,0
i have ptsd ocd borderline disorder bipolar disorders psychosis and add i also have a husband in a wheelchair and a child prayer and the rosary are my anxiety meds i take like 15 meds but prayer and gods healing are what gets me through,1
ask for help!!! even if its just one friend assigned a visit each day to help and be there for you emotionally its hard enough being alone with a baby without a mental illness i have bipolar ptsd gad social anxiety ( which i know makes it hard to be around people) but you need help right now wish i lived close to you i would be there for you ❤️ if youre not on your meds because youre breastfeeding you need a support person looking out for you xxx,0
i am a navy wife and i understand completely i have ptsd  pd anxiety and bi polar i am the leader of our support groups for wives i got involved by talking to the ombudsman there is support out there for you feel free to contact me in pm and i can try to help you as much as i can ,0
im also a military wife my husband has been away 7 months of this year for work i suffer from ptsd depression sever anxiety and paranoia we had zero time to prepare found out a week before he had to leave it is really tough with a little one i temporarily "moved" to my parents for the time as i stay far and only have a small group of friends our military doesnt have a group for the wives so its tough good luck you can do this no matter who says what!,1
i have bipolar and my husband was in the army 23 years i totally know where youre coming from i do suggest anxiety medicine take it day by day hour by hour and minute by minute you can do this,0
it must be so hard i couldnt even imagine i know its hard but try and talk urself down tell urself ur strong uv already came so far u can do this you will be so worried about him whats understandable no doubt he is a brave man with great training he will be just fine and be home with yous soon ❤ stay strong x,0
my advice would be as a person with bp 1 that if ever you dont know what to do to help her? simply ask if all else fails tell her she is never alone because youll be there however due to experience with dating and moving fast maybe slow down sometimes in the past when people said it fast id believe them and bc of mania id have grandiose unrealistic expectations from them and get wicked upset if they dont live up to them! it has caused a ton of fights with past partners i have grown a lot since then but since you are new to it keep educating yourself (you get major points for that!) but overall dont give up and if you ever have to? explain why have a set reason or issue you would have to leave over (ex cheating is a deal breaker for many people etc) make sure she knows and understands that i love that youre asking for advice here it shows you care deeply i wish you luck and thanks for proving not all people suck and are afraid to love someone with a mental illness as it is literally that way for many people with mental health issues we deserve love too and a-holes make us forget that sorry for rambling i hope this is helpful!,0
thats nice! i have an amazing husband that has accepted and embraced me the way i am! i have sever anxiety depression and bipolar! i cant take many meds as i breastfed our daughter and none of the ones that are safe work right! she was manage without meds most the time! if he wasnt so understanding i dont know where i would be right now,1
my boyfriend and i both have anxiety and depression and i think the biggest key for us has been communication its hard for me to express my thoughts and feelings because i get wrapped up in my head and i cant always rationally think through situations when i get panicky he stays calm and gently encourages me to talk to him about whatever is going on ask her though its wonderful you are doing your research but she knows herself best and if you want to please her shed be the one to find out how from good luck to you both i hope your relationship flourishes,0
my husband is just like you i only have depression anxiety and ptsd but he is working on understanding how my treagers for my ptsd work i have only been diagnosed with ptsd for a little over a year,1
you are awesome for not letting her illness scare you off and even more awesome for being willing to do what you can to help her,0
ill give you this advice from someone suffering from bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd there will be times she wont want to get out of bed dont force her just lay there beside her and cuddle there will be times she doesnt want to leave the house dont make her she wont want to go anywhere by herself dont make her you will become her sage place she will become extremely insecure about the dumbest thingsbuy her flowers cook her dinner dont put her down when all she wants to do is sleep when you ate dealing worn these disease it takes a lot of motivation to get up and hey tatu because we dread going into public because we think everyone is taking about us and see what is wrong with us remind her all the time that tipu love hey because when she is depressed she will forget and get desperate and think she is a burden to you and think that being a burden on you,0
itll be a struggle every day make sure you give her space when she needs it but not too much show her you care even when it seems like she hates your guts because she doesnt its just her brain making her act that way let her be open with how shes feeling without judgement my ex was able to tell my mood was changing before i did and he would get me to talk about what was going on in my brain and sometimes it would stop or at least make the swing less intense let her know that on bad nights she can wake u up because she needs a hug and to be held and told how strong she is for waking up everyday to do everything over again if shes too depressed to get out of bed to clean or eat bring her food in bed and clean for her little things can mean a lot more than you think when ur swinging back and forth,0
look up the buddhist term "tonglen"in a nutshell its the recognition that all humans suffer-yes even the horrible ones who cause us pain i have to see the person who caused my ptsd a lot as well hes my childrens father & we share custody (though id rather not) but i sit and look at him and try to breathe in his suffering and breathe out that he finds peace (and maybe remorse toosigh) it helps it really does,1
know your trigers and  remove them even if you have to put them in a different perspective when my anxiety starts i look at the situation and deside if it worth my energy or can i move past it  can i ignore some things and take a deep breath and distract my self  till i feel better  i have stop going places that are trigers and stopped talking to people who are also get you a therapist and yall work on it together  in three years i have been in mental hospital 5 times i had to learn to take care of me you can too,1
im sorry you are going through this ive been there i actually had to move away and even then i still didnt come out of my house alone to grocery shop or anything for fear of running into him,0
my father in law raped me when we were first married my husband was serving in the marines over seas i tried to tell my husband but he was 3000 miles away so i repressed it then whenever i had to see him i would self injure i was a mess seeing him was tearing me apart i finally tried to kill myself over it and everything came out we made ground rules and have stuck by them for 20 yrs now i still flip out when i hear his voice on the phone my husband still visits him periodically its not bothering me as much as it used to praying you find peace and are able to set down some ground rules you are comfortable with,0
im so sorry something so horrible happened to you so grateful you didnt succeed in killing yourself and so thankful you are willing to share your story with others dont ever doubt you make a difference in this world ❤️,0
i struggle with ptsd daily i am triggered by something i see him everywhere it hurts both me and my current boyfriend there is a therapy called emdr specifically for ptsd i wouldnt recommend it unless youre truly ready to battle some demons basically they trigger you until you become unresponsive to it if this isnt a route youd like to go i suggest a group processing therapy best of luck to you seeking help is a huge step,0
i also have ptsd and have to see the person that caused it it seriously males me want to literally kill him everyone i see him because he refuses to take responsibility for what he did i know what you are going through and just to say suck it up is plain stupidity!!!!! im not saying that my fantasizing about killing mine is the best way but it helps me very through it till i get back to my safe place if you arent in therapy you do need to get there me and my therapist are working on me not feeling that way anymore anger is part of ptsd and it is ok to feel that way fear is part of it to find a safe place in your mind sing to yourself quote scriptures pray whatever you have to do till you can get away from him,0
eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) is a fairly new nontraditional type of psychotherapy its growing in popularity particularly for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) ptsd often occurs after experiences such as military combat physical assault rape or car accidents,1
im so sorry youre hurting i too have ptsd but moved far away so as not to be constantly reminded i dont know your circumstances but would suggest changing your routine to avoid seeing them if you can and if youre not in therapy maybe look into it? its helped me a lot,0
i took it for a while but had to stop due to it causing headaches but i tell my patients 3 things about it 1 it tastes horrible (even the drug reps say so) 2 it will make your face go numb for a bit and 3 you will make a face the 1st time you try it most of my patients tolerate it ok,0
do you know if hes having a manic episode depressive or mixed? i live with bipolar disorder and i have different methods for different episodes the hardest part about a depressive episode for me is that there is literally just no stimulation in my brain someone could run in my room with fireworks and i probably wouldnt react much to it but because i accepted that my brains chemistry isnt reacting properly and i know this ive learned to force myself to get restimulated its not easy at all and its a process that can take days or weeks with many speed bumps but 1 i get a decent amount of sunlight every day 2 i do something active every day even if its only a 15 minute walk but i try to at least go for a 30 minute run to get the juices flowing also killing 2 birds with one stone if you run outside 3 i make a short to do list every day nothing crazy maybe 3-4 things and a lot of days i only do one or none and its frustrating and i want to give up and go back to bed and quit but the next day i get up and try it again and i tell myself its ok and try to maintain positive thoughts because the anxious and bad thoughts i know arent organic they arent my thoughts theyre called intrusive thoughts for a reason they come and they go but i dont let them decide who i am as a person eventually after a while of pushing myself i start realizing that i want to run when i wake up and i want to get that school assignment done and i want to take care of myself and continue building the foundation of my future as a partner of someone living with bp i would suggest being that gentle support suggest going on a walk or run with them or ask them if they at least want to sit outside for a bit maybe invest in something like a hammock they still dont have to move or leave home but they at least are outside which is one small step closer the to do list is big for me my anxiety builds up exponentially when i let things like school or work pile up and it makes me shut down even harder but when i start getting things done no matter how small or simple it really helps my confidence come back (crossing things off a to do list has been known to be a good way to release dopamine and help stimulate the brain) i hope this helps feel free to message me if you have any questions,0
honestly i think your approach would depend on what things he is/isnt doing is it lack of self care lack of motivation to go to work? deciding to stop taking meds without speaking to his dr? or self destructive behaviors such as binge drinking gambling before paying bills drug use or self harm? is it a pattern he falls into during his depressive cycle or is this a new development? im sorry to ask such personal questions but my advice would differ based on what is going on and how seriously it could impact his life and/or health both immediately and long term sorry if thats no help but if you want to message me privately youre welcome to sometimes we need support and understanding and sometimes we need someone who cares enough to push us out of our comfort zone of misery and help us get the medical help we need i have multiple diagnosis including bpd my husband has been amazing through it all once he learned what was actually going on with me(he was great before but understanding went a long way to open up communication so i could tell him what i needed and not feel judged/guilty/ashamed),0
first be supportive second try and work with his moods if hes up suggest going shopping together like say we need new towels go pick whatever and how many you want and well sort through them after or we need a movie night lets pick a few movies from this section (the $5 to $20 section) when hes being destructive talk to him dont yell and dont say its hurting you while hes still in that mood tell him his feelings are valid and talk about them when i say that i mean like its okay you feel paranoid about the thing please tell me why so i understand and can see this from your point of view not oh its okay to hit the wall because youre angry when hes depressive bring him water ask about his day tell him its okay he just slept all day ya know do the little things shower with him if you can try new things in the bedroom start with sensation play tickling and running different things on his skin let his nerves feel i dont suggest pain sensations dont spank or prick the skin with anything sharp let him know youre there for him,0
i dont have bipolar but i have severe depression n anxiety so im just gonna give u advice 4 what works with me first dont ask 2 many questions n dont go oh thats so sad n dont tell him that hes gonna got over it also hugs r the best hug him but dont get offended when he doesnt return the hug coz sometimes i get annoyed when people hug me coz they think it will fix everything but sometimes it doesnt n also just listen 2 him talk my closest friends r the 1s who will actually sit their asses down n listen 2 me complain cry n shit idk if it will help him but it helps me :),1
ashley hazel wallberg snarr please look after urself dont get too stressed things may get better even if you get back together ie if he gets help or changes his mind on things or it cud be fine if you stay separate main thing is look after urself try stay calm do activities exercise things you enjoy try stay positive things change so much in life in a short they get worse then get better x,0
do you think i dont know what its like? the fact that you assume i didnt understand makes you ignorant i have ptsd anxiety manic bipolar depression and rad im not the one who gets child support you idiot because im their step mother that is taking care of them their mother doesnt get child support and him not wanting to have a job to at least take off his kids was my point there so until you have been in my shoes and can understand what the fuck i am going through with my issues and all of the effort and strength i have put into trying to help us you can kiss my fucking ass i am not giving up on him i cant do it anymore because he is making my illnesses worse and i cant keeping living that way i will always be there for him and those kids and he knows that but we can not be together anymore and that was a mutual decision not like i owe you a fucking explanation you ignorant twat ive been suicidal since i was 12! you think i dont think about it every fucking day!,0
this comment has really pist me off it is not easy living with ptsd or bpd do you think we dont want help? do you think we dont want to work? because you are so wrong our brains are constantly wondering what the point of life is even when we dont want to think that shit it just happens and then the anxiety kicks in and then the depression of constantly not wanting to be the way we are its exhausting for us then there is the constant repeat of talking about the same crap over and over again with the psychiatrist you just sound selfish and gave up you think your life is hard not getting child support? try living with suicide thoughts everyday and not wanting it in your head anymore take note everything on your post is me me me me me i i i i i,0
sometimes a job could seem like too much pressure or the other symptoms sound like depression it may be frustrating but u cant force someone to do what is beyond their ability,1
i too am in the same situation and for years ive tried to be supportive and understanding but now his job is in jeopardy again he wont seek proper diagnosis wont take meds and just smokes pot our finances cant keep supporting this lifestyle and im worried that we will be evicted among other things its hard at times not to get angry at what can appear to be selfishness on his part its so frustrating and confusing and scary on this side of bi polar too especially when people say why dont you just leave why stay with him,0
one more thing an important aspect of the article you condescendingly shared with me is that the author made the choice how to identify in fact quoting the author of the article you shared "ultimately the key is to ask whenever possible how a person chooses to identify rather than making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs" but thanks again maria for the pick-me-up comment a little piece of advice for you - you have no idea what my issues are and may want to re-think the way you interact with others online particularly in a bipolar/depression/anxiety open page,0
i understand you fully judi it soured rather awkward,0
im on 10mg of citalopram (celexa) a day and have found that it has done so much to manage my anxiety and improve my overall mood!!! i still get depressive episodes from time to time but they usually just hang around for a day or two and they arent as severe,0
i have mood disorder depression & anxiety as well im on 300mg of lamotrigine & 900mg of lithium it has pulled me out of the deep trenches but ive come to accept that i will never achieve full recovery or be cured some days i start to feel hopeless others im on top of my game i never know which it will be or when but thats part of the disease for what its worth my husband has seen a dramatic improvement since ive started my medication,0
ive been thinking about switching back to wellbutrin but im scared to switch to anything now because of what happened i was on wellbutrin back in 1999 for a few years and it was okay but i find with my mental illnesses that it changes all the time it doesnt stay the same over the yearsits ever-changingsometimes in cycles even,0
the same thing happened to me when i switched from zoloft to wellbutrin it was very scary & like you i was almost admitted to the hospital,0
thats one ive never tried is lithium what it is for me i guess im expecting a "cure"now that you say that with the lamotrigine at least i dont want to literally rip my hair out and get very angry im just wondering if i should switch off the celexa with something else but the last time i tried that i almost ended up admitting myself! it was sooo rough! scary,0
i used to get " your the least depressed person i know " i now see a therapist twice a month she said not only am i depressed i have ptsd and anxiety,0
courtney jaye the struggle,0
i have high functioning autism and anxiety ive been told that i can "grow out of it",0
hope your ok karen  its a horrible illness to suffer much love xxx,0
i have a friend that always used to say "fine" when hospitalised for depression in group therapy sessions finally the therapist said she couldnt say just "fine" but to express how she was really feeling (shes clever but im sure its not original)  she said "im fine! f**ked up insecure neurotic and emotional",0
i took it for i think it was a month and it would turn me into a self harming/suicidal zombie it was horrible,0
i used it for a few months and had to switch because of insurance reasons awful to come off of for me (i know everyone is different) horrible brain zaps and suicidal thoughts; constant crying weight loss no appetite i think the no appetite might be an antidepressant thing for me good luckhope it works for you,1
it really helps with my bipolar depression and anxiety,1
it has horrible withdrawal symptoms they had a class action law suit against them it wasnt working for me and they changed it to effexor the muscle spasms were so bad i could barely move had to put me on methadone for a couple of months sorry it was a really bad experience,1
today will be day 3 for me 1st two nights i struggled to sleep and really dry mouth havent noticed any changes as of yet other then the above! started on 30mgs move up to 60mgs after a week,0
once youre on it do not screw around with lapses between refills you will go through withdrawl and its terrifying the short-term memory issues are also very real,0
lily josh jasy yes my doctor who has been managing my anxiety for the last 5 years said it usually goes either of two ways for people- calms them and makes them sleepy (but put on weight) or gives them heaps of energy and loose weight) even though i have had weight gain the positives out way that for me xx,0
has had the opposite effect on me ive been struggling to sleep and loss of appetite,0
i guess the questions im asking are whether you ve had the opportunity to actually explain how you feel in full to your husband and then to your children in a way they can understand? that is probably the most simplistic and best case scenario to increase understanding for all if your family know more could they be more understanding? but of course i completely understand its not always as simple as that there may be many reasons why you cant or are unable to explain why you act or feel as you do you may not completely understand yourself with mental illness it can take a long time until you really get to grips with the symptoms thoughts and feelings for you to understand it let alone anyone else it can also be that sufferers feel ashamed a failure or weak in some way that they cant cope or spend all day in bed or cant get better these are very natural feelings but its not a sign of weakness its a sign of strength when you can admit something is wrong mental illness isnt something to be ashamed of our brains are the most complex organ so like other parts of our bodies sometimes they dont work correctly and definitely not a failure we are all different and we shouldnt beat ourselves up or be unkind to ourselves some people dont really want to deal with it mental illness isnt easy for loved ones to deal with do you have any other support? with recovery this involves many things i wonder if there are other things which might help you being a mother is very hard very demanding we might look at others and think they are doing so well and we compare ourselves and cant understand why we act like we do but with a mental health problem its hard enough coping with our own issues is there anyone who could help with the children? lots of questions but just looking at possible options take good care x,0
i think your heart is in the right place but just sitting someone down and trying to explain such a major feeling is not just that easy i started to post how to cope with a loved one with depression/bi-polar along with anxiety my husband learned a lot from sites it may sound stupid but it is much easier for family to understand from other avenues,1
if my boyfriend would let me this would be my permanent setup unfortunately this is just through summer i love the sound of a fan and the cool air on my face especially helps in a panic attack it gives the impression you have extra air to breathe,0
i usually put on a white noise track on my laptop or music specifically designed to help you sleep has the exact same effect though i once had a dorm-mate who would leave her tv on all night so i had to pull my covers up over my head to make it dark enough to sleep so i would blow a little fan under my blanket to avoid feeling suffocated,1
same here when i get out of routine and become ungrounded i struggle,0
moving marriage divorce babies even graduation are major life stressor and case depression anxiety and manic behaviour in people with no history of mental illness we just feel it faster and sometimes harder,0
yes! im going through a big change also a big move out of state i dont know how to process everything its all very overwhelming my husband keeps asking me if im excited about moving i tell him yes but my face says otherwise,0
im working on my severe anxiety by walking today,1
i actually decided to give up coffee today as it worsens my anxiety especially on wellbutrin cold turkey lets see how this goes,0
yeah but id rather not feel like im on speed and have a panic attack daily its really affecting my ability to get anything done id much rather have a headache,0
might be best to have 3/4 cup today then 1/2 cup the next day then 1/4 cup  etc will avoid withdrawal headaches by easing off slowly,1
i have been having panic attacks and cannot get out of bed or do anything taking my drugs and meditation love to make some life changes but cant do anything,0
i suffer from anxiety but i get so angry it has pushed my family away they said to little to late i tend to like my own company i feel that if people are around me i feel anxious and irritable and kick off and say hurtful things,0
yes yes yes and i hate it it scares me i wish i could stop it,1
oh yeah but i have a wicked temper under the best of circumstancesbut when im in a full-on manic mode i have to distance myself from everyone or risk hurting someone,0
yeah the rage is really bad im a very silent person and i keep the rage under wraps especially at work since i get bullied i dont want anyone to see that side of me im like two different people and its scary that is why i dont have any friends or a social life ,0
i dont know whats scarier wanting to hurt other people or wanting to hurt myself ,0
the rage is what scares me the most that one day i wont be able to contain it and go full hulk on someone,0
yes it can be terrifying especially when the thoughts of violence pop into your head ive always had anger problems that stems from the severe bullying i dealt with growing up,0
christopher l snead its true and before i had any issues with mental health i never got angry or agitated so this is so out of character it scares me so much when it happens ya know?,0
not for awhille but when i got it out was horrible,0
omg i do that too its scary,0
when im not manic im quite stubborn and tend to do what i want but when im manic i become unmanageable no one can tell me anything i zone out lose all sense of right and wrong throw consequences out of the window and make a ton of trouble i get very aggressive with anyone who says anything to me i must admit i have never been aggressive in any way towards a child or an elderly person i usually zone in on someone who i see as a physical challenge or threat and then let loose since i did my dbt course its got a lot better i still go manic and the urges to destroy and hurt are still there but im better at controlling them and recognizing them before its too late and i seek help before it gets to a damaging point like now ive been manic for a few weeks now and as much as i want to hurt someone the worst ive done is have verbal arguments i saw my doctor yesterday and she wants to start me on lithium to help stabilize my mood,0
apps are extremely helpful for in-between sessions to learn about breathing techniques and to keep anxiety under control,1
its for anxiety it is like xanax,1
ive taken it for years and 80% of the time helps great if im having bad panic attacks or flashbacks its not like ive taken anything,1
i take 5 once a day at night it helps overall but in certain situations i still get anxious and upset,1
ummm more then likely yes seek help immediately hun your ass deep in an episode and sadly its hard to recognize in ourselves because we feel what we feel no matter how irrationalasking means you are recognizing on some level try to find that and call your doct or therepist,0
ugh i once stopped taking my meds cold turkey for a few months i got a severe depression and i even felt suicidal so scary! im back on my meds and im staying on them,1
i had a stroke in 2014 because i took myself off my meds have a care talk to your doctor right away call his service now do not resume until you have spoken to him if you have muscle twitching and trouble speaking call an ambulance do not hesitate call your doc,1
dont throw out your meds!!! never stop taking any of these types of meds without consulting your doctor it can be very dangerous also when im in an elevated mood i often feel that i dont need mine and struggle to force myself to keep taking them please see the doc :),1
ive been on it for what seems like forever only bad thing i noticed was some shaking on a higher dose but fine at lower doses i honestly dont know if it works i always feel like shit! i do know that you have to weened onto it because if you dont you can really sick,0
i took it for about 2 weeks it sent my emotions into a crazy spiral some days i thought i was dying i had a horrible experience and was taken off immediately for me it was the worst med ive been on,0
youre not alone tips which have worked wonders for me: green tea 3 times a day daily yoga or other exercise supplements such as omega 3 d and methylfolate corrections to diet! cutting out garbage sugar processed and fake foods and eating as organic and whole as possible obviously not a guarantee or a quick fix but most people would be surprised to find how immensely proper physical health can aid in easing symptoms of mental health struggles,0
i have autism spectrum disorder and am medication resistant before my autism diagnosis i was given the diagnoses by various psychiatrists psychologists counselors and therapists od bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder major depressive disorder post traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder one pa of a very respected psychiatrist ordered me to be on a medication regimen which required me to take 13 pills a day one medication (very recently) had given me such a severe allergic reaction that i remained in a state of psychosis for 6 months an elevated white blood cell count (along with an extensive barrage of other diagnostic tests ruling out other causes of an elevated wbc count) confirmed the allergic reaction i cannot take psychotropic medications because of my hypersensitivity to others i cannot be in a relationship talking about my traumatic life experiences to a therapist helped a little reaching out to a free community service which sent case workers out to my home once a week to check on my suicidality status helped hiring a therapist that performed home visits was helpful hyper-evaluating myself daily checking for signs of progress was frustrating but helped me stay focused on my symptoms from an objective rather than subjective point-of-view super-studying the diagnoses i was given helped me understand my enemies were not my family but were neurological & psychological the only being and force that has brought me through to the point of healing ive reached now and delivered me from people which were feeding off of my illness was my lord jesus my god never left me he never talked down to me never discouraged me and told me only beautiful truth the mind and the physical world have a bidirectional relationship which causes either damage or healing to occur the same is true for our spiritual life it effects our mind and our body i had no choice but to turn to the lord i encourage other sufferers to do the same,1
may i asked how you were diagnosed with a treatment-resistant form? im curious because ive never heard of that and my bipolar type 1 mixed-severe adult adhd general anxiety panic disorder ptsd social anxiety severe insomniaetc have always been difficult to control by therapy meds eastern or western or alternative medicine etc im trying to figure out how i can afford to find the right psychiatrist psychologist/therapist to help me figure out what to do my last therapist and psychiatrist both recognized the stubborn nature of my various disorders but i had to quit my job and i could no longer afford the co-pays for prescriptions and doctor and therapist co-pays i cant go back to see them because i owe their group practice over $600 in co-pays and their billing office and now the collection agency cant seem to give me a break im quite terrified trying to make it without professional help im afraid im stuck,0
wow yep same here with trying different meds and coping mechanisms im sorry to hear that you struggle also hugs,1
i have talked to my dr about ect and i have as i said researched it - and roughly 60% of the information/cases im finding where people who have had it have actually reported how they are doing months/years afterwards have shown substantial long term effects from this treatment they report a euphoria type effect after treatments that can last maybe 6 months after which their depression goes back to how it was or its worse + they suffer deficits they never reported having before there is also evidence that hospitals/dr who administer this treatment do not keep records of following up with the patients whove completed their ect sessions longer than 60days approximate the risk factor for this treatment at least to me far far far outweighs any possible benefit,0

i have researched ect and have found that in a lot of cases this form of treatment can cause extreme damage both short term and long term to the brain while this doesnt happen in every case the risk is still to high for me to consider as my mind is really all i have,1
if youve done itthen i guess theyres not much else to docause thats all ive ever been about i dont ever want to get to this pointid rather be twelve feet underleaps of faith are in my bloodive found that people will and can try to make you a product of your own fears if you stare at the line the trick is to have nothing to lose hahahok wellfear nothing ,0
wish it was that easy but am finally feeling like myself again also starting to leave my house more since i got my dog i take her everywhere she helps with my anxiety,1
never freedom of misery,0
my mother in law forgot me for an aa meeting this morning im upset and will definitely be wearing my pajamas all day long and im not cooking or doing housework im just gonna relax may not even brush my teeth!,0
seriquel lamitcal citalopram and visteril still have severe depression at times my seriquel was doubled last week plus ambien for insomnia not sleeping much is my only manic episode but irritability anger and frustration goes with lack of sleep,1
i have generalized anxiety disorder ocd ptsd bipolar disorder ii with hypo mania & borderline psychosis/personality disorder my medication includes diazepa m lithium epitec purbloce & abilify two are for gad two mood stabilizers one for tremors & the last is a strong antipsychotic all work only partially so i am still chronically ill on top of it all the professionals irritate me with their diagnoses and prescriptions suicide for me is an endless train of thought without my yoga as home practice i would be dead,1
unfortunately i have yet to find a medication or medication combination that works for me been struggling for 16 years now i can definitely tell you my experiences with any medication you are wondering about the side effects the weight gain the withdrawal effects etc etc you can message me any time!,1
i take lamictal and topirimate for depression and bipolar i just stopped latuda because the lamactil is doing great but latuda was amazing for the last three years hydroxyzine for anxiety ambian for insomnia,1
im bipolar 2 depression anxiety agoraphobia i take trintellix for depression geodon for bipolar xanax for anxiety trileptal for mood stabilizer artain for side effects its a lot but weed works better than all of my meds but it not enough for the suicidal thoughts and actions,1
im on tygretol and wellbutrin xl for schizo affective with bi polar anxiety ocd and agoraphobia no real side effects and best part no weight gain,1
i have similar to you except the anxiety is only mild to moderate cymbolta 60mg has changed my world i am doing well on it,1
have you tried saphris its not availible as a generic but when everything else gave me adverse and highly unwanted side effects we tried it back when it was fairly new and i have been on it since in combination with lamictal and ativan (bipolar ii rapid cycling schizoid effective disorder moderate ocd anxiety ptsd with panic attacks) it is hard to find the right combination but once you do if you ever change dr fight for what you know works and then go from there (side effects of saphris i have noticed tungue numbing sensation up to 1hr after sublinguil then it it has completely dissipated [taste ask for script to be written for the black cherry if no cherry allergies the cost is the same if you have medicaid it will cover this med ] sleepiness until regulated into your system,1
im starting lithium in 2 weeks as a last resort im very nervous about it because ive only heard terrible things about the side effects,0
it may be easier said than done but practicing a thought process like this more frequently helps you train yourself to be less stressed in future situations,1
i couldnt have said it better!!! im constantly telling myself that what i am staying upset over is petty but its the letty things that stick and are hard to let go of,0
dont be too hard on yourself hun!!! your body is going through a huge transition and your hormones are all over the place too sometimes we put things down to our bi-polar when actually we are going/feeling totally normal emotions feelings and tiredness related to something else i definitely would keep in touch with your gp though even if its only to talk about how youre feeling what youre thinking and to relay any of your worries or concerns to them sometimes just talking things through with someone can make you feel better and your gp can also give u lots of advice and reassurance i personally wouldnt change my medication at such a time youre nearly there now im the same over my medication now due to previous changes made i didnt react well to the ones they wanted me to try and i had to stand my ground about reverting back to my original meds of sertraline and quetiapine if its not broken dont fix it i say maybe it is just that youre just going through the normal pregnancy motions and always remember you are strong brave and courageous not only because you battle on every day with your own issues but also because u are fighting through pregnancy and for your baby youre a trooper!!! never forget that!!! i wish u all the luck in the world and best wishes in the future tx,0
go to the doctor pregnancy changes your hormones so much and theyll go up and down really bad especially after birth you can choose not to change your meds but your doctor needs to be aware of this and a change of meds can be a temp thing til your hormones settle some from the pregnancy also post partum depression is a very real threat especially to those of us with a history of mental illness please dont try to just tough it out go get help you want to be your best for your child? then you need to take care of yourself first its like the same concept when your on a plane you put your oxygen mask on first then your childs you cant care for a tiny human if you dont care for yourself trust me im 4 weeks post partum diagnosed post partum depression theres a lot of times taking care of my baby is really hard like really hard but its easier to handle by taking care of myself,1
yes go to the doc! your body undergoes so many changes during pregnancy that what used to work may not anymore i was finally put on anxiety meds in my 8th month of pregnancy because my anxiety was spiking my blood pressure so high! i would go to your obgyn and see if he/she had any advice on what to try that will not affect your baby i got my prescription from mine because i trusted him to know the affects better than my gp would,1
i was on prozac when i got pregnant and came off although considered safe being on it in the 3rd trimester can cause the baby to suffer from withdrawal im struggling but hanging on also in my 3rd trimester now its a risk/benefit weighing game and its hard personally ill be doing limited breastfeeding after birth so i can get on a full spectrum of meds and treat it aggressively best of luck to you hun we mommas put up with a lot!,1
oh wow i was on 400mgs of seroquel when i fell pregnant dropped it cold turkey cause i was so worried about what it would do to bub ive got a healthy almost 10 month old now and the depression and getting back stable has been hard but im coming good,0
arent u worried about the effects of the medication on ur unborn child? yikes! hope ur child is born healthy and happy,1
the doctor would take into consideration the side effects verses the good of both mother and babythats what she is sayingthat shes worried about the baby and herselfencouragement not judgment,1
of course this lady would worry about her baby! what a silly question!! she is asking for help not for you to judge her! i am bipolar i have 2 children my first i was not on medication i had very bad postnatal depression because of not having medication while pregnant this affected my child more then tablets would have! i just couldnt bond with her! thankfully by the time doctors had figured out what was wrong and started me on medication! the bond that me and my first child is now amazing and my second child i took medication through my whole pregnancy for her she was healthy at birth weighing a nice weight and the best thing i felt "normal" and i bonded with my child straight away if i ever have a 3 i wouldnt stop my medication unless i was told to by doctors for any reason!,1
very truei fight my depression everydaysomedays i win and some days it winsmy doc has cut down my anxiety and depression meds really????,1
i rapid cycle which for me means that i am manic way more often than not during these phases with my hypersexuality its like walking around as an exposed nerve the wind blows and you want it the riskier the better the rougher the better it has destroyed relationships,0
yes ive lost people really important to me due to hypersexuality they cant understand how that person is not who i am; how i cant control it or how ashamed i get of my actions,0
yes the shame is the worst i have lost my wife and children because of it! i live alone in fear of being with anyone now,0
its sucks relationships have failed because they start to think its only about sex and its not and then i have my down cycles where i dont even want to be touched and they take it personally i feel so ashamed trying to talk about because our culture teaches us that sex is taboo,0
i have lost friends since my teens because of this issue its a relief to discuss really whether in being promiscuous or continually wanting to self relieve very embarrassing when caught or think you may have been a constant battle,0
i have major depressive disorder but have this issue the dr told me that my mind was just more like a mans than a womans when it came to sex i was really upset cause that answer didnt help me at all,1
every doc ive been to has asked about that i knew at times my drive was over the top but i wouldve never connected it to my illness i actually had to have a doc sit down and explain it to me before i accepted it now when im even partially manic i refuse to have sex even if im in a committed relationship i find myself to get irritated when they dont scratch the itch that tends to never go away so to prevent an argument i just keep my legs closed until i know im level again the depressed episode has an affect on my sex drive as well if i fall too low just for someone to touch me pisses my soul off to the point where ill go sleep on the couch because just wrapping his arm around me tends to irritate me,0
this is something that has caused me a lot of pain and struggle and if i ever mentioned it to therapists or psychiatrists they either wrote it off or blamed me for lack of self control this is why its important to have a good therapist,1
i am sorry you feel shame your feelings are perfectly normal for someone in your situation,0
my god i am very sorry amber peacock i have a fear of getting involved in relationships which sucks bc sometimes it can be lonely,0
but seriously at least here in the states we are so repressed about sex i can see how this would be a problem no one want to talk about sex i mean unless they are bragging or something it is weird how we handle sex in the states it isnt handled in a healthy way by anyone even the mentally healthy,0
happens in a manic state and is part of the instant gratification mood for some this can be harmful and they may become abusive in behavior but dont worry most are just over active at times- thats my take,1
you just do! but before that before i turned 28 i struggled a lot! after i turned 28 i learned how to control it a little more easier! dont get me wrong i still deal with it! just not as bad prior!,0
no problem! also its even possible to feel intensely turned on physically even when you are not even close to being turned on mentally or emotionally especially in situations that remind you of past traumatic events this is actually one thing that i was super ashamed of before finally talking to my dr its basically your brains way of coping with an anxiety inducing situation and/or flashback its a physical manifestation of an anxiety attack no different than hyperventilating for years i felt ashamed and disgusted for having this reaction to certain movie scenes i thought i was a disgusting person for being able to feel sick to my stomach ashamed and aroused at the same time talking to my dr and finding out that w my conditions and history as a victim of violence that it was not uncommon to have these contradicting feelings was honestly life changing being aware that i wasnt some pervert and why it was happening and being able to start acknowledging and processing through those feelings and issues was a huge step in the right direction for my mental and emotional health i wish i would have had such a supportive and understanding dr in my teenage years when i really struggled with things a supportive dr and supportive partner are two invaluable things to have when youre dealing w mental health concerns having a partner who can go w the flow and not question when i need it right that minute or when i just want to cuddle for two months is great it takes the pressure off for feeling like "you should do it because youre supposed to want to do it" and none of those guilt trips for sex when youre in a depressive state sorry i guess ive went much farther into detail than you asked for i guess i just wanted you to know that youre not alone youre not "wrong" or broken for having these feelings and it is completely possible to have a happy healthy sex life and relationship/marriage with these issues once you learn your triggers and moods and communicate w your partner and find a happy middle ground together,0
unfortunately it is a real issue idk if its caused by a hormones fluctuation due to chemical changes when we hit a manic phase or what exactly but its like you crave sex like youre in heat and get a euphoric physical and emotional high off of it then in depressive phases we usually dont crave sex as much and want a more emotionally nurturing relationship it can lead to issues such as risky sexual behavior putting yourself in potentially dangerous situations you normally wouldnt such as one night stands or not using a condom and even put you in a position to seek emotional sexual validation from someone besides your partner or even actually physically cheat on your partner even if youre not the "cheating type" sometimes emotional sexual validation is enough such as your partner telling you how beautiful/sexy you are and being flirty other times if youre feeling more emotionally distant you may feel the need to get down and dirty multiple times before you can feel satisfied for the time being its also not uncommon to desire more "primal" rough meaningless sex during these phases and feel left wanting if you are normally they type who enjoys more gentle love making without communication it can lead to frustration in the bedroom with good communication you partner can learn to read you signs of manic state and be able to adjust their approach to sex accordingly but first they have to be able to understand why youre feeling this way and what they can do to help what to avoid and so on sorry i may have had one too many conversations w my psychiatrist concerning sex as some of my issues disturbed me until i found out they were pretty normal for ppl w my diagnosis learning that there was not anything "wrong" w me its just how my brain works definitely made it easier to talk to my husband about without feeling ashamed feel free to pm me if youd like to ask any questions in private,0
actually google is not all that reliable however i have to know if this statement us true and if hypersexuality is real as i have question about my own sexuality reagrding my diagnosis with depression/anxiety,1
it can lead to risky behavior especially in severe cases think black snake moan type behavior in a committed relationship it can be fun to enjoy though,0
absolutely i go through those same thoughts every day ive been diagnosed with bipolar disorder anxiety with panic attacks ptsd add and severe depression have you considered seeking out a therapist or a psychiatrist to read diagnosis and see if medication may help?,1
id like to but i never really knew where to begin i started having stress tics and went to a neurologist and they prescribed me topamax to help with my anxiety and i told them it didnt do anything and they never really listened to me and i just quit going and taking the meds after awhile because it seemed they didnt want to help no matter what i told them i think im going to go to my regular doctor and find out what she can do to help me,0
omg! i miss me more than anything else that ive lost through all of my struggles,0
its such a horrible illness to have im right there with you carmen!!!,0
friend i have been through the whole gamut of depression and angziety meds and cymbalta is one of those that work well for the ones it works for and dosent work well in the long run for some i would suggests that you have a good talk with the doc and please let him know how you are feeling for your well being friend  i have been where you are very depressed and felt like all would be better with out me my fiancee is my best friend she seen my moods and total lack of desire to do anything i was in facked giving up on everything and everyone so i really do know how you feel friend and ill share this with you i went all the way to the act of taking my life thank god someone saw me and called for help  i told you all of this so you know that i feel your pain and know your true feelings so please talk to the dr and im sure many people have told you that ill be hear if you need to talk but i really mean that ill be hear i know how the thoughts and feelings can be overwhelming take care and stay in touch if i can help you are a good person and you are worth it,0
i stated taking cymbalta last month and they started me at 60 mg i got really bad shakes in my hands for a bout 4 days then started sweating profusely! i want to change it but people tell me to give it a shot! i hate the sweating part and it helps me sleep and my appetite isnt like it was either!,1
you are definitely bipolar try lithium its the one med for bipolar that wont cause tardive dyskinesia maybe klonopin! at least your reaching out! you absolutely need a therapist especially if you feel you want to hurt others lexapro targets major anxiety which seems to be most of what makes up bipolar it helped my 2 family members they still struggle but they arent as angered one of my family members said it helped them from feeling like they wanted to killmedical marijuana needs to be not just for chronic pain but definitely passed for bipolar because of the dystonia type side affects the anti psychotic medicine for bipolar can cause im praying you get control because its just as hard on the family and youll want your children to grow up healthy normal life can be hard enoughblessings/praying,0
i saw my family members grow up with this disorder it a major stuggle and was hard to communicate with them my dad had bipolar and was an alcoholic hes passed on but thinking back i feel so bad that he grew up in a day and age where these problems werent protrudingly aware as they are today i have experience horrid past events and i can tell you those problems you can get over with the right talk therapy i also heard exercise can help i know you posses bouts of excessive energy with bp so if you can take up walking jigging running to burn some of it off i think one of the main things is to try an catch yourself when you go into mania im not sure if you have control over thattry to just keep telling yourself its the illness then maybe lift weights or jog you definable need to control the depression part how is your job status? working hard with good pay does much for the self-esteem hang in there,0
you are not alone therapy along with the right medication can help tremendously if your psychiatrist isnt there for you find a new one who will be i cant imagine what stress you have gone through in your life but know that god doesnt give us more than we can handle you are a strong man and you will find the help you need when thinking of harming yourself remember that your kids need you when i would have harmful thoughts i would remember my family i can do this youll be in my thoughts,0
i want to but im afraid theyd turn me away claiming im not in a volatile state to do so,0
if you feel there is more to it beg them for help dont leave their office until they help you you cant be expected to live like this your wife needs to get involved more in understanding your illnesses i know you feel like shes giving up on you but probably just doesnt understand maybe get some books from the library or if you dont want to go there yourself maybe buy some online maybe if she reads the effects and symptoms of these illnesses might help her help you may not realise this but knowing you have an illness and feeling like there isnt something quite right going on with you is a massive step in the right direction just keep holding on it must be so scary to feel this way and not know how youll be from one hour to the next ive witnessed similar things as you when i was growing up and been beaten by my step dad and sexually abused that all fucks you up i understand where youre at im sorry for all that has happened to you and i wish you all the best mate,0
hi i suffer the same your background sound a bit like mine i was you not long ago my family walked on egg shells i never meant to be the way i was i just couldnt handle or cope until i was put on lithium it helped a lot my family started to feel more comfortable around me so maybe you need to look at your medsas for them understanding my husband doesnt need to understand just a hug when im feeling low or i just take time out and let everyone know im not feeling to good tell your kids and wife the truth about how your feeling that way they know its not them its your illness i tell my kids and they understand theyve lived through it with me not telling your wife and kids that when you feel the way you do and if your nasty or irrational its not there fault you cant go through this on your own your a family and letting them in they get to know the real you and your wife and kids will be able to go through life feeling understood you also need to say sorry when youre being nasty or say something you shouldnt it takes time but as family we worked it out im sure you can too i am also 40 and think it gets a little bit harder i hope this has helped if you need to ask me anything you can pm me i know what its like x,0
how sad i was reading your postit was like listening to my son who had exactly the same symptoms as you are experiencing it took many years for him to finally find a professor of psychiatry who put him on the right meds and he is now coping much better dont give up on yourself there is always a solution! i just suffer from severe depression and anxiety but understand what you are going through sending you hugs and blessings from south africa!,1
oh your not alone at all  im sorry your suffering but you pretty much took this out of my brain  and theres a a few things u mentioned i will also look into  thank you for sharing <3 helps me feel not so alone  yeah find a new therapist doctor whatever  i do suggest trying marijuana and finding the right strain for you and theres also dif products that dont get u stoned if u needed to work  i really hope you find something and some one to help  iknow how scary and fucking frustrating it is take care if you cant take it one day at a time try to takw it hour by hour xo,1
all else being equal with your mental health issues something happens to a large majority of people when they approach or hit 40 its almost like a mid-life awakening of sorts where you start to really dive in and process some of the shit that has lead you up to this point i am bipolar ll also borderline personality disorder has come up more than once with my current psych also it is what it is flow with it and continue on with the process try not to overthink it and dont stop until you find something that works for you i take lithium which i was told was the gold standard first line treatment for bp2 and it works very well for me take a deep breath and talk to your wife when you arent in the midst of a crisis and ask her to take the lead for you and dont beat her (figuratively) up if you can at all avoid it we all need someone in our corner stay the course for you and the kids you are not alone,1
ptsd sucks they said i had it during my intake assessment but the psychiatrist dismissed it not sure why she asked me some trigger questions and i guess i didnt give an appropriate response although ive been plagued by being terrorized as a child i will definitely be getting a new psychiatrist thank you nick,0
unfortunately a lot of ppl live with that stigma but what they dont understand is that its hard to get the help needed and deal with everyday life too ive heard that only weak ppl go to "crazy farms" but personally i think that only the strongest ppl are willing to try anything to get the help they need and deserve! financial issues will always be a problem and to that i say the risk is worth the reward and there is always bankruptcy finances shouldnt hold ppl back from feeling better good luck to you ,0
sounds like a very complex set of symptoms the thing that truly helped me was dbt therapy and mindfulness it was very difficult for me to begin practicing consistently but i kept at it its taken me 4 years of learning that essential oils calm my anxiety a mood stabilizer and sleep meds make sure im getting enough sleep staying hydrated do my dbt worksheets and have become more patient with myself its not easy to change my reactions and volatile aggression but it can be done! its a lifestyle change like any other dbt works if you work it also would recommend bpd central forums and also nami family to family program for your adult family members wish you all the best!,1
well getting in the practice of a mindful life very difficult imo esp for people who struggle w mental illness we tend to feel out of control and over reactive so practicing staying in the present is quite challenging becoming a master self control is daunting least it was for me,0
i see you and i hear you and i acknowledge you i have been on epilim and serdep for 11 years to treat my bipolar which is as severe if not more so than you i want to encourage you today you are not alone my friend i have done many things i regret have been in jail 3 times as a result used drugs and been in countless fights im a former marine so violence and death does not scare me drugs are not the answer however i support the use of cannabis oil 100% i have learnt how to manage my bipolar and would be only too happy to help you if youd like my opinion and i say opinion for a reason because i cant take advice and instruction that well and feel the same may apply to you message me if you like and ill help remember one thing you are not your mindyour mind has bipolar your soul does notlearn to live in your soul and your life will changein my opinion from one bipolar to another from the other side of the worldi care for you,0
yeah i kinda left out alot of my story as i felt it was to long i suffer from anxiety (time issues) and ocd i have become more awkward in social settings as i didnt use to be my story is long and some of it very concerning and intense (things i did as a child up until my teenage years) ive wondered if i have bipolar l,1
hi first believe without a doubt that you will be better talk to yourself daily say i am getting better repeatedly eat healthy food drink more water and exercise hope you get better soon,0
have you tried marijuana? it could go either way may help or could make it worse different strains have different effects either way i wish you all the best for you and your family and hope things get better for you,1
yes it helps tremendously! however my state oklahoma is extremely rigid with itso i do what anybody else does,1
yvonne white i take it for depression and anxiety it has really helped my mood disorder i take 40 mg every morning just once a day!,1
i want to agree with everyone that her self harm is not your fault not now and not ever having said that maybe the two of you can talk about the stressful things that make her feel the need to cut are there things you can work on together? even if they are small it can make a world of difference knowing that you are working together as a team to conquer a common enemy for example i have chronic pain and depression and my husband and we make sure that we both say we are mad at the pain and the depression not mad at me my pain and depression are part of me but they are not my whole self banding together has made us stronger because fighting these demons alone is exhausting i would also strongly encourage you to find a couples counselor even if you can only afford a few sessions if you are a religious person you could also see if your place of worship offers reduced/free counseling try checking out namiorg and find support groups in your area - you should not have to fight alone i hope you can find the strength you need to find your own healing and to support your partner in theirs,0
you cannot i stress cannot be held responsible for the actions of somebody else her self harm is her choice you didnt make her do it you need to be strong for you not her,0
i know how hard it is to talk to people with social anxiety clouding all your thoughts but talking to each other and probably with a professional as well if possible it really is the best and only answer try to figure our how to help each other i would give almost anything to have another person in my life who was similar dont let yourself get further away,0
i have ptsd chronic depression anxiety and bipolar your symptoms qualifie you for social security disability im on it took me a year to get you need a disability lawyer otherwise you will never get it,1
what does your comment mean? i am so confused! lol ~dani,0
effexor is terrible with withdraw and actually made me want to kill myself if its working for you just give it time im always tired and im on zoloft its better than having panic attacks,0
i took effexor for years it helped me a great deal though i was always super tired and i gained quite a bit of weight on it i was afraid to go off it after hearing about side effects but i really didnt have any trouble at all my dr weaned me properly if this med works for you stick with it for a while,1
totally heather hrejsa it was awful i think my body finally decided i just didnt need it and it was really messing with me i definitely have bad days but i can manage and deal which is great im back to the old me although i need adivan to help my anxiety other then that im pill free i can feel things and not feel like im trapped in my "movie mind" lol if that makes sense,0
effexor made me more depressed as well it was horrible,0
me too im scared to get off it if i ever do,0
i did miss a a dose once and it was horrible i could handle it to an extent my doctor tries to help me but sometimes i think shes tired of trying especially since im still suffering a lot from things like lack of good quality sleep extreme fatigue even though my moods are more stable she said once my moods were more stable the rest would get better and its not,0
seroquel gave me horrible reactions! along with a 25# weight gain puffiness and an attempt at suicide i opted out!,0
did it upset your stomach?,0
im on 375mg daily i think it helps to scared to stop and try otherwise as my bones literally start hurting and i get electric shocks if its missed,1
if it aint broke dont fix it changing psych meds can be life altering; and in some cases life threatening when disclosing your medication regimen to others you will receive all kinds of "advice" even from professionals do your own research on fda warnings for your meds avoid "word on the street" advice most importantly listen to your own body and mind,1
ive never been on celexa but effexor does wonders for me only thing is how horrible i feel when i skip a dose im afraid coming off it will be hard,0
oh no! that scares the fuck out of me im so sorry u had to go thru that paxil gave me the brain zaps really bad,0
its a horrible drug to come off even when weaning i tried for a few months before christmas last and even weaning properly my head was still getting brain zaps 5 months later back on it now cus the world got too real without it good depression drug to numb feelings and help you handle the world but a fucking nightmare to try and come off,0
jenn if i may ask did cymbalta put on weight or is it still too soon to tell im ready to give meds another shot out of desperation i have a bit of a problem dealing with weight gain some say i have an eating disorder once i start packing the weight on i automatically quit the med sounds petty but it is just me,1
i have severe adhd ptsd depression and anxiety plus a dissociative disorder so finding a drug that works is hard i just take hydroxizine now im pregnant so after baby comes ill try things again effexor never again tripped me out,1
send him out to work that will take some of the stress if that does not (work) give him a few strong whiskeys that would do the trick ,1
the first step is to make sure hes not using drugs or alcohol because thats not helpful at all when you have depression and try to commit suicide a lot of people do that because they using narcotics or drinking alcohol the thing is sometimes people dont say whether they coming from it will be easy i think like for me to let you know where you can get help because i dont even know where are people location cuz im in new york city right now dont give up i cant stop writing you about my life because what will never finish trust me i taking care of my daughter we bipolar disorder my son we bipolar autism as bergen adhd and more and more diagnosis and myself we bipolar ptsd anxiety depression fibromyalgia what else do you want you want me to continue telling you my diagnosis trust me sweetie im not going to give up and no diagnosis i got days i dont want to leave but i realize the only person can take my life as god you strong woman you doing the right thing and i know in this page will be the right person to conduct yourself why you guys got to do as a family but never feel guilty what you write make me feel even cry because i know you have to be a wonderful woman thats what he pick you and look hes bad days you are there for him just continued prayers to god god bless you and i hope everything goes well for you and your family,0
this may sound a little off beat and i may not be right but i know from personal experience of having done suicide attempts i never told anybody about it i just did it unsuccessfully i might add because im still here at least hes telling you when he feels that way which is normally a cry for help maybe they need to try different medications its hard to be a guinea pig and find the right ones is he interested in counseling or group therapy do you have enough influence on him to get him to try these things maybe even suggest to him that he was not able to stay strong for himself at least try to stay strong for his children because if he actually did try to commit suicide and died just not he that hes hurting its the whole family and i bet you that your children would never be able get over an event like that sometimes even children feel guilty and think that its their fault because of what their parent has done your children need to be spared from those feelings try and see if you can get him reengage with some talk therapy and be positive that they can find a medication that works for him,0
please be very careful suicidality and homicidality often coexist simultaneously in someone who is moving in and out of psychosis the threat of suicide can also be a manipulative technique to prevent you from fleeing for safety with your children that doesnt mean his threat of suicide is an empty threat but no one can begin healing with the fear of death lingering over head if your gut tells you to leave then leave i am not speaking in judgment but from extensive experience not just with myself but in almost every relationship in my family please follow your motherly instinct over your desire to be his wife,0
i know its a completely different situation but this response is more geared towards you my late husband fought cancer for 2 years before he lost we had 2 boys already 10 & 6 and had just found out a week after he had his diagnosis that i was pregnant with our rainbow baby about 8 months before he passed he told me he was ready to go and that was truly the hardest thing ive ever heard that doesnt even describe it i actually got really upset with him because i couldnt understand why he would just give up fighting for us like that i finally understand what he was trying to tell me but i promise you those words still haunt me today if i had any advice for someone thats heard this same thing from someone they love its for you yourself go talk to a dr or in my case dr and social worker therapist asap also try to lean on your personal support system more than i did and just remember to breathe as for him i absolutely agree with what was said above about getting him to a hospital so they can get him feeling better there is absolutely no shame in having to do that!!!! mental illnesses are just as real as things like heart disease and diabetes! i hope some part of this helped my heart and prayers sincerely go out to you and your family if you ever feel like talking please please friend and then message me so ill see it right away!,0
look up saphris i take 10mg daily for harmful thoughts i also take geodon 80mg for bipolar and artain for side effects its a lot but ive been sick for 35 years and this is the best i can do and i still struggle so on those days i smoke weed to help slow down my thinking where i can control myself,1
you need to see a new doctor i have bipolar and struggled really bad but am coping with appropriate meds and extra support definitely seek medical help urgently because sometimes thoughts and what others think are just threats can turn into suicide without any hesitation as horrible as it sounds some people find that its their only chance of being free from it all ive lost 4 friends from suicide and none of them even showed symptoms of depression it is a very well hidden illness that can be treated to be manageable xxxx,0
there is no shame in going back to the hospital if your family screams scream back louder until they hear you sending hugs n prayers,0
at least you have your family they scream at you im alone with 2 kids my daughter is an adult and my son is 11 struggling we autism right now hes in the hospital my daughter wants the same way and wasnt real easier for me but look i made because i start speak up and tell people would ever win the city said they got help i need the help that the city offer and they will help you i have couple hospital i live in the bronx new york not even if i was crazy i will leave my son over here so what i do i travel to manhattan new york and we got to help with this serve as a human being sweetie its always positive if you leave far away in town you dont get the help you dont have to tell you family feud adult get a train get a bus and go to another town that you can get the help that you deserve because anywhere they have to treat you the right way and then if you wanted to get in contact with your family you put them in the list so they can called you but you have to let me know where you are at to see if you location will help me more to help you,0
please go to the hospital you are important & if your family doesnt get that then you need to distance yourself from there toxic attitudes i did it & it has helped me alot i have ocd depression social phobia & anxiety please do it for you good luck,1
i dont know how old you are but your dx changes as you get up there i have so many issues but the dire ones complete anxiety or disassiotion depression crippling as it is your left with so many issues but luckily the panic and deep depression seems to let up but seriously you need a dr to give much needed meds (i cant stress this) someone needs to look out of the box everyone you know is in the house im medicated which such a dx is a must because of chemical imbalance but i was raped tortured by my brother and 1st husband i had a twin sister who killed herself leaveing me to raise her twin babies what im getting at you can get though anything just try really try to look out of the box you have a life there too,1
in all honesty you truly need to check in to a hospital take care of yourself and dont worry about your family yelling at you you can tell someone at the hospital how youre treated by your family it may be considered abuse for the way they treat you also you might want to look into disability for your illness,0
get help hun try not to stress and tackle one thing at a time or you will be overwhelmed,1
i know you dont want to but going to the hospital may be your best bet you are more important than your familys views dont worry about them yelling at you you can ask the hospital to not allow them to visit you you do what you need to even if its against the wishes of the family youre loved and you will get through this ,0
what about ssdi? (or is it ssi? lol i cant remember)i dont know if i can help because i also have bad anxiety and depression as well as social phobia ptsd and other issues that i honestly cant even remember because my brain just wont work right however i did try starting a group on facebook and eventually all over the place for people who couldnt get the right help from doctorsor worse get abused by doctors because of our disabilities i just started it recently and i have a lot more work to do (and a ton of ideas) but i cant sit by and let this continue we deserve to be happy and healthy too! the only issue is that it is extremely difficult to form a group of people when thats my biggest fearbut thats also part of what motivates me ive been a prisoner to my own mind for way too long and ive let almost everyone take advantage of my brain not allowing me to say what i really mean or need to; like "no" or "i cant do that" sorry if this is too long i just really want to help not only you and anyone else but also myself i will try and find out more information if you want me to and im also still trying to get more people aware of the horrific health system so we can get some real help,1
oh gosh honey you are differently going thru alot why not try to get ssi? i was also a self harmer many years ago i know when i got overwhelmed it did help but there are many other things you can do the only think that helped me when i was anorexic it was all about control over never ending feeling you can do this for you and no one else if you need to go to the hospital then go and if intakes your family thats to bad i can definitely understand where you come from with your family keep your head yo and god bless you,0
i agree with lynn all we have is our health that is a basic human need and without good health we have nothing other things in life may need to be put on hold like your schooling you cant be the best student unless you feel mentally stable ive been where youre at i lost my job because of my mental illness i had legal troubles i reached rock bottom when my husband asked for a divorce and told me i was too unstable to see my children at the time i balked at him assuming i was inadequate as a parent i realize now that my judgement was clouded because of my illness it took me a year to gain an inkling of trust back with him here i am 5 years later and the happiest ive been in 15 years this road is hard you need the support of family friends and medical professionals i hope and pray you find that ❤️,0
right on! i feel it isnt doing me any good i was taking cymbalta but they weened me off and it was horrible i will be talking with my psychiatrist next friday maybe i can try lamotigen & latuda with cymbalta i just worry about the negative effects of weight gain from the combination of meds,1
i have those same behaviors with my bipolar ptsd and panic disorder youre not alone each day is new maybe push yourself beyond your limits and not in your comfort zone to do things to help make yourself feel better baby steps small baby steps,0
this could not be truer i so badly want to run away but how do you run away from your own mind mental illness sucks every hour of every day is a battle you know life isnt that bad you want to be happy but it just dont happen that way so you get aggregated at yourself you know others have it worse so you feel selfish to feel the way you do therefore guilt starts building i just want to scream i want to be normal i want a break so i look at the day hour by hour just to make it through and tell myself everything is fine im just tired if you are struggling with mental illness i want to say keep trying and you are so much stronger than you give yourself credit for,0
so sad and yet so true i am alone in my struggles,0
i get that this is how people feel (i suffer from panic disorder/agoraphobia so i dont have bipolar but similar issues i have a close friend who suffers from bipolar and i know she is on this page some of these posts i feel need to be more uplifting and not so negative yes its the truth how bipolar minds work and i want everyone to understand how mental illness feels but this post in particular just bugs me some people who see this may depress them more i dont want my friend thinking there is no hope for her more uplifting stuff please,0
yeah i get that true i know what its like to feel alone and knowing that im not is certainly helpful just some are a bit much but it also comes from fear of having a loved one take it wrong guess ya cant win mental illness just sucks but i get what your saying as well,0
yet we feel guilty for what we are feeling,0
i suffer from severe anxiety cant leave the house most days depression; negative thoughts overwhelm me i self medicated while on my prescription meds with weed and perks and i actually feel goodhappy energetic but doc wont give me them,1
just keep reminding her that you want to understand to be able to support her better! its tough to open up fear of being judged just keep reminding her that you love her and only want to help! she will eventually come around ~dani,0
i have bipolar 1 borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder i have two kiddos 7 yrs and 19 months i understand as they are the reasons that i am still alive i lost my job of 5 years due to a manic episode where i lost all rational i have had a hard time digging myself out,1
i just keep telling myself "i will come back" i have rapid cycling bipolar 2 that for years and years has been untreated as its polar extremes where not so damaging i could fit in and survive without anyone really knowing all those years i got to know myself and my disorder then just over three months ago bam my depressive episode came and stayed it is darker and more destructive than anything i had felt before all of my worst days were not in fact my worst i can at times by not sleeping eating and taking un prescribed med induce a high/mania but hell if i thought my new low pole was badmy new high is just scary so iv reached out and am now properly medicated almost a month on medication now no real change yet but no ones got the phone in hand calling the white bus so i think i must be doing okay my disorder has changed instantly for what appears to be no reason i think my rapid cycling days are over im in for long standing mood shifts that stay like seasons all the time i disliked my disorder i now want it back we are still here underneath all the cloudy turmoil on the surface you will come back we need to conserve the energy for calmer waters and then swim fast when we are able not doing anything doesnt feel right i know and waiting for everyone else to catch up when you have asked for help is just crushing hang in there you will come back i feel that if i give up now going through these real bad times then all the other times i survived become worthless i thought they were the nightmare they were not maybe this isnt either i am a soul inside a body with a mind that doesnt function properly i am here i will come back to the surface just as soon as i can so can you if you can pick up a pen writewrite it all though dont read it back always a trigger keep it safe till your better able to understand it take something from it all later if all it does is get it out and onto paper thats ok if you can share it with your closest friend ask them to quietly write back find little ways to reach out when you can you have survived so much already fellow warrior do not despair! you will be back x,0
perhaps celexa and a hormone replacement would help just a suggestion but it has helped too often women have major hormone issues that contribute to depression anxiety and insomnia just a suggestion,1
i am sorry to here that i take it for anxiety and depression and hot flashes i take 150 mg a day,1
there is nothing wrong with effexor my daughter takes it and it has totally changed her life for the better she used to have such social anxiety the one thing about antidepressants and mood stabilizers is that they dont work on everyone the same way i have been on many different ones over the years i have taken viibryd for the last 2 years and my doctor just added cymbalta i dont think that is the correct spelling,1
the moods are fairly stable compared to usual its the overwhelming amount of fatigue that im dealing with my memory isnt great anymore and of course the pain,0
my doctor had given me time that havent worked and the effexor was prescribed by a different doctor since i was so desperate ive select years upon years trying to get better and finding a good doctor is just as bad,1
i love cymbalta im still on 30mgs was supposed to bump up to 60 mg but since i moved out of state (from the state where dr gave me the script) i havent been able to bump up and im sort of worried to cause im only 114lbs and dont wanna end up overdosed,0
its without a doubt one of the better ones ive had been on it since 2008 and found it very effective,1
works well for me only side effect ive had is that it makes me drowsy otherwise its kicked my anxiety and depression in the balls,1
i had terrible experiences with it it caused extreme anxiety and brain zaps i could not tolerate it and withdrawal was hell too but everyone reacts differently,1
very effective with anxiety,1
horrible side effects and almost impossible to come off/- find an alternative if possible,0
this is the only medication i have been able to take ive only been on it 2 weeks and already noticed massive improvement with my anxiety and i havent cried once no nasty side effects neither! i can eat and i am now able to sleep at night without sleeping pills its helped me so much,1
no i have never tried it but id love to know if it works for you i am suffering with no medication and desperately looking for a support group here in tampa so if anyone knows of a doctor or specialist i can see on a sliding scale maybe? i dont have insurance so any advice would be helpfultyty :d,0
i was in the trial studies years back i noticed a change couldnt really pin point what that change was but thought it was better than nothing after continuing for another 4 or 5 years i had to come off of it that was truly the most horrible experience of my life it was worse than coming off of opiates after a few weeks i had to check myself in the hospital for suicidal thoughts(intense thoughts) my mood was vicious angry and unpredictable be very careful taking this drug and even more so when you have to come off of it there are side effects that they have not put on the label and withdraws are one of them,0
im on it its been more than a month now and it seems to be working my anxiety levels have been reduced im also taking serotia for mood stabilization and depressionü,1
dont panic its organic! hhoo ,0
my wife was on it and it made her brain shake and the brain zaps were horrible and then getting off cymbalta she had discontinuation syndrome,0
i was feeling hopeless too for quite some time and couldnt get my severe panic and agoraphobia under control finally found a med combo that works i still have a journey ahead of me but im doing much better you will find that too you just have to keep trying different meds and therapy dont know you or your situation but i believe theres hope for us all,1
i love cymbalta been on it a while now but suppose to be taken off all my psych meds in the next coming months as my partner and i are going to be trying to become pregnant and worried about the withdrawal,1
it destroyed my appetite for the first month or so otherwise ive had no side effects and it seems to be helping im back to enjoying little things in life and my hobbies i dont know about its effect on anxiety bc i take other stuff for that also i have less back pain which the doctor said could be from this medicine the downside i guess is that if i forget a dose then i start to feel very uncomfortable about 12 hours after the missed dose it feels like electric currents are discharging in my head and face but ive had this happen with several antidepressants ive been on antidepressants since i had an eating disorder in high school over ten years ago and this medicine seems to be the best yet or at least a close second pristiq was good too but sooooooo expensive if your insurance isnt great then check the good rx website they have like coupons and stuff for all sorts of meds,0
ya i was thrilled then i went thru a personal rough patch where i was hungry again now im awake after midnight been up since 8 am havent eaten anything all day and if i wasnt worried about getting ill i could probably go to sleep without eating all day but thats not healthy make sure to have balanced snacks even if you arent hungry bc your body needs it to stay strong,0
i have also the start up have big crasch :(:( and i must also zeprexa i am so afraid normaly i can not taken ant depression pills dont understand life whit anxiery all the time :(:(,1
my mom has been on antidepressants and anxiety medication for nearly 25yrs now for so long it seemed nothing would work shes now on cymbalta and rexulti and is a completely different person! in a good way! everybody is different and will react differently to certain medication take it as prescribed and if you notice any side effects call your doctor immediately! they are not going to give you something if they dont think itll work for you and your diagnosis best of luck to you!,1
gail deshong it felt like a weird panic attack all the time nothing visible but inside it felt horrible it got to the point that i couldnt function because it was so distracting and brought me to psychosis,0
as already stated it can be hard to come off of it its probably good youre increasing dosage gradually as already mentioned the withdrawal can be awful also please carefully read all of the side effects if you have some of the scarier side effects happen please have a supportive friend or family member on speed dial you might also consider healthy snacks like chocolate covered nuts if youre not allergic these may help a little with mood but are not a substitute for medication dosage modification should be done by the doctor with all of your experience with the medication disclosed,1
been on it a couple of years withdraws is huge! i got very suicidal and felt terrible paranoid etc its worked ok for me i still have difficulty during hormonal time,0
mood stabilizer (lamitical) is the bipolar med cymblta wellbturin prozac are all antidepressants manic depression anxiety,1
absolutely horrible spent nearly a month in bed worst medication i ve ever been on - nearly killed me!!!,1
oh really :( thats terrible and scary,0
it was the only med that helped for my depression anxiety and chronic pain but i had to come off due to jaundice,1
good for depression hard to come off of side of effects of stopping are horrible,0
a guy at work really likes me but im petrified to "let him in" ive told him that i dont want to be in a relationship but he wont give up! i push people away,0
i gave up many times too but even so i never truly stopped caring i have social phobia and general anxiety disorder among a few other problems but they arent nearly as bad as the social phobia i cant get help from the right people because i cant express myself the way i want to; like i cant tell somone what the problem is i cant even get to the point of talking to someonebut i had an idea that changed my outlook (even though its still eating away at me it will get better) i decided that im going to start recording myself most of the time and start a youtube channel it will give me a way to push through the anxiety on my own terms and at my own pace it does give me hope and even if it fails it will still have helped a lot but one of the biggest issues is that i keep getting stuck on starting anything i always feel the need to be pushed in a direction so i can know what im supposed to be doing i hold myself back by not just going for it so this is me going for it lol i appologize to all the people that keep having to read my long postsand thats not a joke i really dont know if its my anxiety or not but i feel like im the only one who talks this much on facebook maybe even the whole internet lol (okay maybe it was partially a joke) ill shut up now,0
summat dewberry praying doesnt do anything magic isnt real stop acting like doing nothing is helping people im ashamed i have to explain that to you i hope youre a child santa unicorns and the easter bunny are not real either sorry,0
yes because what happened becomes amplified in my sleep so what was already hell turns into horror,1
healing must take place on all three planes of your existence: spiritual psychological & physical pray specifically about your bpd your symptoms your fears give thanks for triumphs there is power in jesus name also develop daily routines there is some comfort in sameness routines also help you guage the severity of downshifts towards bouts of depression anxiety attacks or the onset of a psychosis strictly care for youe body vitamin deficiencies can prompt the onset of depressive episodes and angry outbursts study study study yoursrlf your past your present your habits & all the "whys" of your life i am praying for you now,1
my last episode had mixed psychotic features which really scared me,0
talk therapy dbt life balance classes all of these are great the more you understand your disorders the better also remember youre not alone here this group also has been a great help to me talking with people with the same disorders and knowing how they manage it dont expect medication (if prescribed) to work right away sometimes it doesnt work and another would have to be tried everybody is different so medications would be trial and error until a combo work perfectly for you i myself am currently on celexa but it only helps me with the anxiety not the depression im supposed to be taking a mood stabilizer but i cannot afford it right now without a job again remember youre not alone in this,1
medications and dialectical behaviour therapy have worked wonders for me dont delay and try not to be afraid things can and will get better if you work at it,1
you have been given some very good advice by others already ill just say its very normal to feel anxious on your return to your home with time it will pass as you slowly get back into the positive aspects of your day to day life style dont put too much pressure on yourself your only home take your time try to get some fresh air each day its very easy to fall into a pattern of withdrawing from life due to the anxiety personally i wish you well just dont put pressure on yourself immediately baby steps work okay regards,0
have felt the samescared of my own shadowis there anyone who could stay with you until youve found your feet again?,0
perfectly normal! when i would spend stays in the hospital and then get released i would do a bit of nesting make one room my comfort area start slow and and let my living space grow dont overwhelm yourself,0
being scared is totally normal its because you dont have the safety and security of others around both professional and other patients on the unit,0
its ok to feel scared your starting over being home which is a great thing you have opportunities to do what you want when you want its all in timing you have time to do things at your own pace every step counts for something i wish you all the best,0
i was absolutely petrified after being in the hospital a month just take it slow it gets better but every day is a victory!! good luck you can do it!!,1
after a week being i am scared to be home or going out anywhere i suffer from the same things you do i cant handle being in any store unless my husband is right by me or i will freak out,0
any change effects us so you should know going home and being afraid is normal!,0
i think it will only b natural to be at least a little bit scared i know i was it is just getting used to the outside world again it will take time but it will fade if it gets too much u can always reach out to the local crisis team for help dont b scared to do that also remember it can only get better ur not alone x x,1
is it scary to be alone yes make a extreme effort if you mzke neigh ors where u r they can check on u and u them we all meed help,0
i felt the same way after my discharge i was disoriented and not sure of myself it will pass i did hop/iop afterward and it helped you can always call the crisis line if you need to talk to someone to help when its overwhelming,0
i am sometimes scared still even though ive never been to a psych ward i have all that you have i use to give myself panic attacks to the point i couldnt stay home alone it helps if you use lavender oils to breathe in for anxiety it also helps to talk to friends during the time you are scared im available to talk when you need a friend i beat the panic attacks but when my husband leaves sometimes its hard i also ended up getting a dog to help but if you need a friend add me and talk with me im here,0
i dont know if you like animals the right now they offering and different states animal for companion i think thats the name they call and if you like animals that would be a good company for you but remember one thing the dog is going to be your company but you also got to taking care of the dog really well and i have a puppy right now and i dont feel alone anymore i used to feel like without people i can leave and now i do not want people around me anymore because i dont like noise it gets me very irritated when people being very loud around me or they arguing and im feeling better i dont miss no one,0
it most definitely is normal if you have medication to take it regularly as prescribed the fear should subside,1
this was my question thank you all for being respectful to my question i was in the psyc ward for being suicidal i hope that this scared feeling goes away soon  i cant handle being scared to be by myself it feels so overwhelming ,0
i have no one to stay with me im scared for myself,0
i was scared to be alone after i came out of the ward too i stayed with a friend the first two nights,0
i got a dog shes a big help but i just cant fight this feeling its overwhelming feels like im going to have a panic attack,0
it is completely understandable you were not alone for a full month have you tried maybe getting a pet? they are therapeutic and can start to recognize your anxiety/highs/lows good luck and you can do this!,1
thank you for letting me know that im not alone  i dont know how to act i feel like im going backwards this is so scary for me  feels like im losing my grip,0
of course youre scared so much has happened in the last few weeks and days you can pm me if you want,0
i was scared of everything reallyeverything seemed different like i was seeing it for the 1st timeit gets better good luck,1
when your ready to be on your own youll know if your scared it may not be the right time to come home ive spent several times in the hospital when the medicine and mind set is good then your ready,0
being scared is totally ok to be feeling even though being in a psch ward is hard you know you are going to be safe being out on your own brings a full list of emotions that you need to try and manage take it hour by hour and when you get through each hour you are coping and achieving be kind to yourself take baby steps try and get help and support from those you can trust when you need it and keep telling yourself "i can do this" we are all so brave to be fighting our battles everyday we have to believe we can do this sending hugs xx,1
this is not all the time but when my anxiety is really bad i will turn the tv right down to still an audible level but a very quiet level as i cant try to get calm if its too loud,1
i am super sensitive to noses too i get irritated very easily to any kinds of noise i never really thought to tell my dr though im on so many meds im not sure they could help w this i have no polar and anxiety disorder they might just tell me to get over it lol but for real noise is a huge trigger for me! i snap out!,0
can i just say that alcohol is the worst thing for anxiety and depression youre not self medicating youre destroying yourself further not only should alcohol not be consumed with the drugs youre on but its also a depressant and can raise anxiety levels especially in the hangover period this is probably why you dont think your meds are working,1
i have 4 kids and i can not handle loud noises at all i have to near silence to concentrate on the task or question at hand ptsd bi-polar ii rapid cycling anxiety ocd ,1
loud tv gives me huge anxiety especially when the ads come on and someone tries to talk as well it caused so much stress i hardly ever have it on its like my brain cant cope with it,1
try and cut out the alcohol if you can it doesnt mix well w meds i personally cant smoke either sends my anxiety through the roof  loud sounds send me up the wall especially mixed w other noises i stay clean and just take meds therapy dbt also exercise i need to eat healthier hang in there it gets better,1
well u still shouldnt worry maybe she just needs a bit of a break its very hard on them too having us to deal with lol we are not easy people to be around especially when were ill tx,0
u need to ease up on yourself with everything u been through that ive just read u are doing amazing well youre still working something ive not been able to go back to and youre taking positive steps as in going out whether youre sat on your own or not thats a brave and courageous thing to do again something i couldnt do u need to give yourself more credit for the things u are doing and try not to focus on the things that youre not as for friends!!! i understand only too well how gutting it is when your circle gets smaller and smaller but we need to understand how they feel being around us especially when were not doing too well my friend told me that she was scared at times of my behaviour and that she found it really really difficult to deal with she couldnt cope seeing me like that and i do get it i was terrified at times over how i was how i behaved how i couldnt function whatsoever and how i was emotionally and mentally that being a complete wreck!!! so i can imagine how she must of felt i wasnt me at that time i was a nightmare to be around i laughed one minute babbled rubbish at a million miles an hour the next making no sense at all i ran round like a loonatic cleaning etc then the next thing i could be crying sobbing screaming and wanting to kill myself yes we have a daily battle with ourselves sometimes just to get out of bed but we also have to look at how difficult it is for our friends and family to deal and cope with us wishing u well tx,0
find some support groups so you can be around people that can help without depending so much on your friends it sounds like you might be straining your relationships because you depend too much on them keep going you can do this!!,0
sometimes friends get overwhelmed when you depend upon them too much all the advice given here is very good do not be afraid of the doctors or therapists you just need to take the time to talk to them plus group therapy might also help you might also want to stop going to a bar where it makes you feel more lonely think about other places that you might like to try i went to a library and just read a book there were lots of people around me but it felt ok and safe,0
doctors help with a lot and so do friends i know it feels as if everyone has deserted you and i have been there but through different support groups ive found the best friends a girl could ask for i had an ex husband and it took me almost 5 years to remarry bc i was scared of men too however i got lucky adhd is hard to deal with i was diagnosed when i was 21 i had a hard time adjusting but things got worse now i am on different meds to help i overthink about everything and it sucks i havent figured out how to stop but i do have friends and my husband to help i have been in your shoes and dont be afraid counseling helps a lot you just have to find the right therapist and the right program also lavender oils do help with stress i would recommend that i burn candles and wear a necklace i hope that helps,1
dont be afraid of the doctor and a therapist can teach you tools to function more socially which will in turn positively affect your overall mood good luck a lot of us truly understand stick around use us,1
its ultimately your choice but personally its the best choice i have ever made it took a while to get the right combo and the right doses but i have been doing great now for about 2 years still have some good d aha and bad days but no where near what they used to be!!! i can tolerate it and i like to say "pull it together" when i need to it will always be a struggle but the meds made things so so much better for me i see things so much clearer now,0
i also struggle with bipolar ii disorder and depression and anxiety i am on abilify and clonazepan and trust me i am so much better on medication and without it when i was on the wrong dose i would have really far spread highs and lows but they would last a long time and now im at a happy medium i still have highs and lows but everyone does not to mention the fact that i am a woman and hormones play a huge part in my imbalances hope this helps,1
i have bipolar one adhd and anxiety,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar ii about a year ago i have been on meds since i was a teenager but i have never been on the right combo of meds my psychiatrist is in the process of switching up my meds right now i am thankful that i have been able to be on medication i had such horrible depression anxiety mania and anger before medications it is totally worth it to be on the right meds! the only downside is finding the right combination of meds it takes 2-3 months for the meds to kick in completely hope you can get the right combo of meds!,1
i am on medication for bipolar 1 you may start to feel a mood change like you are happy one minute and 60 sec later you are angry with the world i dont have really hypermania but i am very depressed with severe anxiety i take clonazepam lamicital sertraline and trazodone it helps a lot i am trying to get the right doses my mood is the biggest lamictal helps with that however with counseling and learning to cope with our medication helps a lot but i know several ppl who are on medication for bipolar hope that helps,1
my opinion you should have speak to your doctor but a lot of people with weed the same diagnosis they take medication because the way you feel i think you got to start with a small dose dont get panic all medication has side effect especially psychiatric medication you can lusso gain weight you have to first do you research whatever the doctor wants to prescribe you because that was my problem i didnt know i was supposed to do my research be careful a lot of the medicine they can give you you even diabetic i didnt know why i feel that way that i only want to crave sugar and fat food in greece food but a lot have to be with the medication you have to do a research because its not easy dont get scare at the end of the day we need to get help we got to be responsible not like older they know what they have and they dont look for help so try to be comfortable with your doctor and your therapist if you need both and do you research and try your medication with a small amount of those also so you dont say that satisfied will be really bad like i used to it little by little step by step if i dont work for you its going to take time but one day you will get the right one good luck and god bless,1
i refused to take meds for bp2 and anxiety until about two yrs ago i had finally gotten to a point that i couldnt move from my bed i couldnt leave the house i couldnt take care of my children it took a bit to get my meds right ive never felt so good im finally mellow and and my thoughts are not racing everywhere i still have the anxiety and am learning better to cope with that but my moods have finally leveled out and i can enjoy life and the small things so much more i wish i had started these years earlier i feel like i missed so much of life,0
meds dbt family support therapy might take a while to find the right meds  as time changes you might be able to take less and during rough times more i have bipolar 1 anxiety depression ptsd and chronic illness adhd i take 5 different ones and im still changing the doses  but im doing good took a while hang in there good luck,1
i did not realize i was bp ii until age 40 when full blown hypomania hit me i need mood stablizers for hypomania and anti-depressant for anxietybut i have gotten my life back and may be even become a nicer person in that i am no longer doing mental and emotional gymnastic just do ordinary thingsin the end if you need meds they will likely improve your quality of life,0
i take seroquel and viibryd prescribed by a psychiatrist seroquel is a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic viibryd is an antidepressant my depressions are debilitating i feel both meds have helped me a lot but i still have problems dealing with stress i take klonopin as needed i just stay home a lot i cant deal with people i also see a talk therapist i feel it helps a lot too,1
if you do start meds pay close attention to the changes it makes i was given an anti depressant and my manic spiked so bad it almost ruined my life a different anti depressant they put me on put me through worse depression and im still recovering from the sour effects that second one made me more suicidal the third med they put me on was venlafaxine (i think thats how you spell it) that one helped me more than the others but eventually my husband and i learned how to cope with my anxiety depression and bipolar the most important thing is having a good support system i honestly dont think if be here today without my sister mom and husband,1
i have been on meds for 5 years they were helpful to get to know myself while i had stress going on in my life which i couldnt control ive extensively researched & am now weaning of meds to eventually go med-free & control with exercise diet & meditation im going to give it 6 months to wean slowly because i take 3 sorts of meds antidepressant antipsychotic for sleep & mood stabiliser,1
richie ingles the less packages and preservatives the better fresh veggies but routine is huge! i have to set my alarm to remind me to get ready for bed sleep is so important for my moods,1
i also have bp2 and anxiety i choose to medicate my depressive episodes get so bad it is my only choice if i want to be some semblance of "well" it has taken me a long time to find the right combination of meds but i feel for me it is the best choice i just started going to therapy again too and that has helped immensely,1
i have bi polar and the best decision ive made is to take the pills they help control the raging fire inside but i dont have anxiety or sddepression so the meds might not work as well or even make it worse,1
the 2 best things i ever did once diagnosed was to quit drinking and start on meds it took alittle while to find the right combination stick with itgo to a therapist regularly alsoalmost 3 yrs laterand i no longer have to take anxiety meds i or meds to sleepi take lithium and wellbutrin i still have symptoms but the severity is less,1
i need medication to feel good otherwise my brain is a scary place to be,1
i have bipolar 2 and adhd i struggled along most of my life with nothing until 8 years ago then i was put on the right medication and it has helped me so very much,1
all of this is sad but truei live it everyday!! my son dont get why i cant get up out of my room and go shopping or anything else for that matterwhen i come to my room life just stops for melike i cant cant get outhelp!!! how do u just get up and gomy life all changed in 2000 and again last yrso much death in my lifemy biggest fear is the fear of death!! the worst!!,0
i know what you mean exactly i figured out that if i learn as much as i can the better i can explain to friends/other support what i want them to knowyou probably know a lotits pretty difficult to explain it to someone tho some days im so anxious i dont know what to sayto anyonelet alone explain this!! read things articleswhatever you find helpful for yourself and maybe refer them strait to that,0
i understand but then again the people who understand are literally so few and far between and they only understand to their best ability i hear you and youre not alone its a tug of war struggle,0
you are definitely not alone! i have an excellent support system but have people who have a hard time accepting my diagnosis​ even though its been confirmed by 4 separate psychiatrists i also have bipolar disorder major depression generalized anxiety ocd ednos and panic disorder many people who dont have a mental illness dont understand that all of these are often symptoms of each other and are all interconnected so often people think youre either a hypocondrac or just super "crazy" i just tell people that i have bipolar disorder and really bad anxiety i also understand about feeling guilty you have to remember everyone is different and everyone has their own experiences youre allowed to feel the way you do its not of any choosing of your own ive found that holding in my emotions and feeling guilty does more good than harm i journal my emotions now and pick a person in my support system to confined in,0
nope you arent wrong i have all these and find people who will listen we all deal with some kind of anxiety etc,1
rosemartin rodriguez calina trembly,0
mika haara we all die none of us gets out of this alive however you are here on earth for a reason now we all have choices not to choose is making a choice life is a fight and everyone has their own fight their own pain all of us are fighting for our minds there is right and wrong good and bad love and fear once we fight for ourselves we can take our experience speak to others in pain and walk along side them to pull them out of darkness but no one can want you to live more than you want to live for yourself you have the power and all you need inside you to live a great life you cant see it for some reason but there is greatness in you!!! we all have the power to choose life if you want to live i pray you choose life❤️,0
some people are very bad at under standing those who suffer any illness to me many seem so self righteous children are important so understandably a parent will be concerned that they are capable of doing things the right way therefore they need a partner who is not a selfish prig not self righteous not selfish if he is so selfish & lacking in under standing he will never make anyone happy so ditch him the world is full of kind gênerous & caring men i doubt if he will make any one a good husband let alone a caring father,0
wow right now you need him more than ever struggling with depression and anxiety is not easy and when your supposed support network deals a blown like this it makes you so so much worse yes being in a relationship with someone who has depression and anxiety can be hard but if you love that person unconditionally and are committed to them then you go above and beyond to try to understand and help them does he not think that if you just be "normal" (fyi i bloody hate that term but you know what i mean) then youd do it in a heart beat? depression and anxiety are debilitating theres no two ways about it quite frankly if he cant support you in the way you need and you dont fit his so called "perfect" ideal is this really a healthy relationship to be in?,0
having bipolar disorder and being a parent myself he has legitimate concerns i am a good mother i do anything i can to make sure my kids are taken care ofbut there have been times that i hate to admit when i have been manic i am not the best parent i can be it puts a lot of strain on my kids and my significant other he has to make up for where i am lacking and that is just added stress for him with a good support system though and a partner who understands the illness it can be a sucessful family it takes work!! from everybody i hope they can find a way to work out their issues and be happy!,1
i have been with a few men who couldnt handle it & it is literally awful when they dont understand or dont even try on one hand he seems to be trying but maybe needs to try to be a bit less blunt with how he says things to you as you are gonna take it to heart as all of us with any mental illness wear our heart on our sleeves i am now with someone who understands so much more & jesus it is different my sister is the one who worries about me with children but no matter how old how drugged up or how sad i am - life goes on & if i have a sad day its gonna happen no matter what the situation so we have to learn how to deal with it but that doesnt mean our mental health is gonna change i would say see how it goes with the councillor & if they cant make him understand more then im afraid he never will & maybe you need someone who will support you a bit more rather than telling you you will be a crap mum,0
back in 1999 my mom and sister told me i should let my daughter go stay with my sister for a little while i did because i was pregnant and couldnt take my meds my mom and sister made a plan to have me sign papers for brianna to be able to stay for the summer it turned out they were actually adoption papers as i was off meds i was confused and signed the papers not fully understanding what was going on adoption was final 2000 my sister never let me se or talk to my daughter again my daughter passed away in 2002 from heart complications in 2012 my ex took my son away from me the judge stated because i had been hospitalized for 5 weeks i must have been suicidal or homicidal therefore making my ex a better person to parent i had my son for 15 years! people make me so angry judging me for my mental health!,0
yes corina dismang i am trying and i now realize the beautifulness ( illness) of the struggles you go through and the many reasons im in love with you !!! i may not understand completely and learning and understanding you is always worth it  love you forever swee tart ,0
i think this is a reasonable concern for someone to have granted the way they went about it is horrible and sounds somewhat biased off of basic common stereotypes it is still something that could be very serious in the future if it does turn out that way when you have a kid that should be your priority and you cant allow your depression to prevent you from parenting your child granted i am of the mindset where my own parent had it i have it and i have become terrified of passing it off even further i still think its a valid question,0
god forbid he has kids with a woman who will suffer from post pardom depression and any woman who has kids and becomes a mom is never "solid"  he lives in a dream world of ignorance and tv land thinking of stable solidity when kids enter the picture it puts more strain on the marriage and everyone life if you dont learn to work together and pick up slack for one another one is weak so the other will be strong and you will switch roles every now and then,0
yes i have struggled many years you can overcome this with the right meds good food and exercise dont give up!!!,1
some of you are giving terrible advice i myself have depression anxiety and bipolar so i understand that what he said hurts but at the same time someone without these or similar illnesses has no clue what it feels like to live with them everyday hes right you need to be a strong woman to raise children but hes also trying to understand and continue the relationship despite the mental illnesses seeing a counselor is a great idea to help both of you understand each others concerns and positions work with him and see where things go,1
look youll be ok i i suffer from chronic depression anxiety and bipolar and ocd and i have three beautiful children and im a great mom to my babies so dont let him put you down rl man doesnt do that but help you,1
hes an absolute shithead! if only he knew what it feels like to have anxiety of depression such a selfish man thinking of himself maybe he should try helping you a bit & being there for you x,1
this didnt happen to me however a lot of my anxiety and depression came from wanting a baby and it never being "the right time" now that i have my little boy and am on anxiety meds i have never felt better! i have this incredible zest for life!!! i can understand his concerns and even though they hurt they are valid concerns that need to be addressed i hope your therapy session goes well - there are so so so many moms (and dads) who deal with mental illness every day and still totally rock this whole parenting thing!!!,0
i am divorced because my ex husband could not be supportive of my ptsd life is too short for him to judge you like that dump his ass he is not helping he is just upsetting you,0
no doubt!,0
its really hard for people to understand also specially men when they dont have what we have i just realized now 41 years old why i can stay stay when a relationship and its because no one understand and mens try to control my life when they see me those days really depressed or without motivation they take advantage and situations that we pass like anxiety so i realize that its better to be by myself right now that im not ready anymore to people try to control my life i feel like i own my own self and if someone is not happy with me and im not happy with that person i appreciate to be by myself and keep it moving forward i feel like i know how to control my emotions better when im alone then when i have someone i get very exciting when i meet people and at the end of the day everything is going away so why try again im happy right now when i have a man i get very depressed i feel they demand for too much and i dont like when people start criticizing me you can do this you could do that that they said i had to be in bed you dont even know me it can be like today a beautiful day but i feel a little drowsy i would love to be sleeping right now but i can have to do responsibility but right now no one is telling me not to do my responsibility if i wanted to i dont have to do it i dont do it but if i would have a man he would be in top of me bothering my head and i really dont want to do that anymore my life i prefer to taking care of my son 11 my dog and continue looking for god thats what i want,0
i raised 4 sons alone i will never say it was easy but it can be done dont be with someone that doesnt see your value and your worth just because your struggling with a disease you didnt ask for hell probably end up being a lousy father anyway with thinking like this,0
the chance of passing it on to a child is big  and meds can cause horrible bith defects  i was born w 10 i am 37 and was told during my last episodes not to have them and it sounds like the the guy wouldnt be much help a child is a huge responsibility even if their born healthy  the risk of passing this on is real have you ever considered adoption? i know you want to have kids but there are so many that need good homes try and get your health squared away it isnt fair to put your wants before theres meds alone would cause them to suffer the world is hard enough you know this suffering isnt fair for anyone you can do what you want just do your homework get the help u need first  and go from there im sure you wouldnt want your child to have the same things your dealing with hang in there  your worth it hope this helps coming from a child who has this disease that was passed down to them not intentionally but we know more now research and weigh the odds,0
i dont have depression or bipolar disorder but i do have a chronic illness that makes it really hard sometimes all you can do is the best you can take care of yourself its not as if you asked to have depression or anxiety if someone cant understand and be compassionate then they may not be the right person i have lost alot because of illness including friends and romantic relationships the ones that took the time to try to understand i value the most so sorry this happened positive thoughts sent your way :),1
im severe bipolar every damn day is a struggle i dont do meds hate the way they messed with all of my health and created more issues i absolutely force myself to get up go to work and take care of my kids ive learned to hide my depression and anxiety ridiculously well my wife pretty much never notices my struggle my ex husband however used to tell me to "take another pill" "youre weak" etc my mental illness is a huge part of me but it doesnt shape who i am im opposite of most on this post and my advice is to push yourself every single day even if you just get up and shower you at least conquered one battle one battle at a time each day and congratulate yourself on each step in the end you are the only one that will change you support you and stand by you maybe hes not the right guy you have to learn to love you and embrace all of you before you worry about his acceptance,0
walking a lot diet helps too things like turkey and chicken help with sleep anxiety is harder mine hits with change and a lot at night with dreams typically i have to sit in the car and talk myself down if im out in public at night my wife is really awesome about just holding me until it passes i do a lot of vitamins as well lol it works for me but i had to rewire my thinking and that took sometime,1
i rely on meds u are very strong!!! i absolutely believe in pushing ones self!!! the results shock and amaze you!!!! how do you cope when agitation kicks in? and anxiety? one follows the other with me and haunts me to move end! ,1
i suffer with depression and severe anxiety i have 3 children i get up for them and care for them are some days harder than others absolutely but i live for them my partner understands and we talk about it i tell him when im down and most of all i share when im scared he is my rock and when i need a moment he steps right up your not incapable he is he wants to add to your insecurities by telling you that your not "solid" solidity between couples is built each one puts their work in you got this girl and the right "solid man" is out there for you,0
the thing you have to understand is that yes depression is mentally and physically exhausting to you but it is for them too maybe not as bad but it is i struggle with major depression and pretty bad anxiety and im a mother of a 13 month old girl being a mother has helped me in ways that medication cannot but i refuse to take medication at all so i do it all on my own just be understanding of him and the most you can do is go to therapy do not be mad but you have a right to be upset you can get through this both of you can  but both of you need patience,1
i have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life i get your struggle however im sorry i totally understand his text he is completely right in his concerns,0
wow some of the advice being given is just horrible hes willing to go to her counselor hes willing to express his feelings and worries he has legitimate concerns how about give her real advice besides you should dump him hes not willing to understand  youre kidding right hes doing everything to try to be there and understand maybe yall need to be more understanding just because we have mental illness does not mean we can wave it around like a white flag every time something goes wrong and be off the hook and if we dont get let off the hook its a chorus of oh theyre not willing to understand no youre not willing to understand the diagnosis is not a get out of jail free card for your behavior and choices if this is the actions he sees every day them good on him for speaking up and saying his concerns kids are hard work and sometimes its going to be hard especially when depressed lets not pretend its not,0
ive been in this predicament and its taken a while but hubby has come around to seeing the bigger picture it took for me to see it too i have a few lazy days then balance it out by going batshit crazy when i have the energy to go!! haha it really takes understanding on both sides for each other to get anywhere the fact hes not holding it in means hes fighting for the relationship how u go about it from here on in knowing this affects that let him see ur best and worst hun!!! (bipolar and anxiety) ,0
agreed one really does have to pull oneself together for ones children however hard it is though i think the best parts are when you surprise yourself by doing what needs to be done regardless of your own anxiety or whatever one gets to sit back at the end of the day and say ha! i did it and pat oneself on the back it proves to oneself that one really can do it in spite of everything the guy sounds great you really should work for him he sounds worth the effort,0
yup and let me second that kids are extremely hard they arent going to validate you or make your life better they can be great for couples but for many couples they cause strain med changes & adjustments? no luxury for that with kidsyou dont even go to the bathroom by yourself for a couple of years if you dont have a very understanding partner to raise the kids then youre screwed i dont know this couples exact situation but better he bring it up now rather than 5 years and two babies down the road after post partum hits hard and both are angry and sad: him from resentment and her from pain (which we all sympathize with of course thats why were here!) im hoping his text was for an open loving talk i hope the best for her-for both of them getting that text must have been so heart wrenching and im so sorry but i cant knock him for at least trying to have the discussion about his fears,0
anxiety depression bipolar disorder can be easily overcome once you understand how your mind works i had bipolar disorder myself for 10 years now i am med free and back to normal i am helping other people overcome their issues if interested message me,1
i am very self aware (shocks the hell out of my counselor sometimes) and no it is not "easily overcome" at any point even though i know the coping skills even though i may know why im feeling the way i am at that point even though i for the most part understand the disorder and have done extensive research on my diagnosis it has never been "easily overcome" it is something that i have to work hard at daily and some days i am just too mentally emotionally and physically tired to handle much of anything i have my days when i have very few spoons to start my day and i struggle more so on those days once again this is not something "easily overcome" for most people with these illnesses,0
this is why i am single with no children ive just seen my fella through two years after he had a meltdown down  i helped him because i know from experience what he needed but earlier this year i ran out of steam and my bipolar kicked in i thought he would understand my anxiety and depression as he was so recently there himself but not a chance its all about him and he only wants me for how i can help him when hes down guess what? after a lot of heartache im single again it takes someone really amazing to understand and support someone close when the black dog strikes,1
its the truth some days i have to fight myself to be there for my kids its a struggle but i have back up plans when there is a need for help,0
my fiance and i both have anxietyi have depression with anxiety his anxiety is daily and constant and makes him question our relationship and makes him repeat the same things over and over my depression makes it impossible for me to get out of bed talk move or even move my eyes its difficult but communication is key i hope a therapist can help you im considering getting one for me and my fiance,1
i firmly believe that if you are unable to take care of s child yourself dont have one bipolar disassociative disorder ptsd since i was four months old bpd anxiety i get my ass up every day and take care of my kids i know people with cancer who are in better shape than i am so yes i would say it,1
my husband whos very scientific struggles with understanding my daughters mental illness but one thing he does not dispute is that she is the best mom her illness has made her even more accepting and compassionate to peoples needs and differences it took him some time in counseling to open his eyes let your therapist and dr help you make your decision bless you,0
i will be praying for you! i am going through something similar i have been trying to get a divorce since april 2016 after 33 years of marriage my depression and anxiety were used against me he had me hospitalized several times and i had to leave for my sanity! i met a new man and everything was great until i couldnt control my crying he doesnt understand either i am a good kind person who helps everyone else,1
into 13 years of marriage diagnosed with bipolar depression anxiety 9 years ago my husband doesnt understand my illness but he separates my meds goes to dr but refuses to read up,1
for me i cant sleep cause of these fucking nightmares n night terrors  been up since 5 30 am yesterday morning ,1
night terrors,0
i sleep well but only cause i take seraquel at night also the best part of my day horrible hey but i find each day a battle especially the mornings,1
this sucks writing this because i have bipolar type 2 as well as ptsd but this mentality is making us sicker i say this because if we hole up and isolate stay indoors and shut out the lights were only feeding our depression what it wants its impossible to get better even in the slightest bit if we play this card is it hard to get out of bed for me? yes do i spend soo much time in my head that i come up with the most irrational thoughts? yup but i try to do as much as i can in a day even if im choking back tears and wanting to just disappear all of us have that one personsome many more than one that depends on us breathing that alone makes us special we are way too hard on ourselves at times and no one might understand our issues but someone out there loves us for the messes we are unconditionally and thats beautiful,0
how i feel right now moods have been all over today buy mostly down and just wishing my existence was gone no one understands or if i try to explain i run ppl off its hard to open up with ppl who cant and never will understand so i try to bottle up my fears and my pain,0
so true told doctors medication isnt working well it helps with the low lows but thats all i feel so depressed and cant shake it,1
im struggling too youre not alone,0
be brave you can overcame it i otvaranje 10 years of bipolar disorder inclusive of panic attacks once you understand how mind works and how to use it in a beneficial way you can achieve the similar results too if you are interested message me,1
ive had some jobs that sounded great at the time to find that they were meaningless pressure cookers that paid well and didnt really improve the life of anyone around me even providing direct care in hospitals so satisfying and the pay is fair comes with a set of shackles that prevented me from doing the right thing for sick people i dropped out of nursing school with one semester to go i got a masters in social work and am pursuing counseling careers at least i have something to say about the treatment plan ill take a pay cut for that,0
are you doing what you love or what you think is expected of you? after exhausting my fmla for other family members i left my job love the job but not the politics i had a higher call for my life but i had to be courageous enough to find it and learn to let the newness of life live! courage is simply taking your fear and moving forward not allowing fear to pigeon-hole you in life dont be afraid to do what you love it may not be the popular thing but it will bring you peace❤️,0
i also felt anxious every day going to work then i started to look at the whole picture i really looked at the things that led up to my anxiety during my first two years attendance was terrible and last year i was hospitalized for having a full blown breakdown i came to realize my job was not worth the stress or my mental health i just looked for another job with different advantages this may just not be the job for you right at this moment in time but let a dr or therapist know how you feel it may help getting on an anxiety med,1
try to get help with your doctor because they have medication for anxiety and they will help you a lot good luck,1
i hope you can talk to your dr about this soon maybe you can get fmla or even better a paid medical leave i had fmla for mental health days once it was in place my boss couldnt give me a hard time about needing to be off or anxiety at work reach out blessings,0
everytime i get a job i go through this and i always end up quitting its a horrible feeling,0
one day you will im learning on not to dwell and take up a hobby,0
dont worry nobody knows how to do those things,0
thats all you can do i suffer from bipolar ptsd and panic anxiety disorder not many people understand me either baby steps small baby steps period i get it because i live it youre not alone,0
i feel every word you have written in my heart and souli am 40 years old and have struggled for 30 years to cope with myself the self harm and suicide attempts are getting worse by the day i have 4 older boys wich are the only thing that keeps me alive but im afraid i havent got any fight left wich inturn leeds me to more despair ,0
hi sarah im a 54yo bipolar doctor and have had ect for 15 yrs with good success  the treatment has evolved over the years now no memory issues after treatment  but let me tell you that nothing has helped me more than daily intense physical exercise and regular mediation  game changer ! great for anxiety issues associated with the bipolar disorder  no anxiety much better sense of well being  good luck dr john x,1
haha dont worry the day might start off like that but i wouldnt let it end that way without trying my hardest <3 <3 xxxxxx,0
im trying so hard to stay strong and to get through this best as i can but with little to no support i just feel defeated everyone always leaves and nobody understands its harder than what people think im sorry to anyone who feels the same as me heart breaks easily and it hurts to the point my muscles do tense up for days i do sleep too much i binge eat and participate in risky activity im just sad because i feel like if i never would have started taking bi polar meds i wouldnt be bi polar but it was all to get out of an abusive situation now im stuck,0
because i dont know who i am anymore ive been rejected made fun of put down and hurt so many times and the ones who claim they care are the first ones who are the first ones to leave or give up no im not happy with my life yes im trying to change that but the thing i want so desperately bad keeps getting held in front of me and just when i think it is finally going to happen it is yanked away again and again like its some kind of joke,0
exactly how i been feeling as of late i always try to push forward but recently it just feels like its so much harder things that i use to look forward to dont matter anymore im not myself the self that was barely there to begin with and its horrible,0
this is me all over forever making plans then if i feel low on the day i say im ill and literally lie in bed all day doing nothing dont no why im like this but its horrible as it makes me feel miserable but nothing makes me snap out of the low depressed feeling untill the day i wake up feeling happier but its a horrible thing to keep going through being a manic depressing for weeks on end to overly happy and wanting to take on more work and challenges,0
guilty lydia winwood tia cohen amie crossland,0
i have no idea what people think i dont really care but i definitely struggle every day to stay alive,0
i love this!!! i wish more people understood the effects and struggles that people with bipolar disorder/anxiety/depression and or all of the above deal with each and every day! its a constant struggle to stay on track and adapt to the changes that come up in your routine!!!! its very challenging and overwhelming but somehow someway we adjust the best we can and move on!!! i have always been embarassed for being bipolar along with having anxiety and depression i always felt like i was crazy i hated it! but recently i have learned more about being bipolar and i am gonna embrace it and make the best of it! i deserve to have a good life and i will make it the best i can despite what mental disorders i may have!!! my goal through it all is to go from saying "i suffer from bipolar disorder" to embracing it and being able to realize its a diagnosis it doesnt mean that i have to let it bring me down i will embrace it and make the best of it not just for myself but for my husband and my 2 girls that i have been blessed with!! #bipolarawareness #iwearpurpleforbipolaranxietyawarenesss #lovethesupportpage,0
what happens in the mind is the most scariest thing ever my mind is truly fucked up,0
this this and this so afraid,0
finding a way to force yourself out of bed even if its just to the mailbox does make your entire day different you at least make it to the couch and think about leaving the house some days you end up leaving some days you are then able to force yourself to do some chores especially if you have someone depending on you to do so i know i may sound like someone who doesnt understand - but trust me  i do im there right now went somewhere and forced myself thru it back home now and feel the same way however i am forcing myself to go to iop at the local hospital before it gets so bad i need to go inpatient this life sux but having just that one person that understands and doesnt judge changes your life entirely - you just cant overload them or expect them to change you you have to put in the edson period and yes i agree it is the first sign it is not easy it does suck and i simply couldnt force myself through an 8 hour work day yet if you do and can my hats off to you some of us that deal with these issues are the strongest people in the whole damn world even though we appear very weak to others im hoping this group im starting soon have my intake hearing today puts me in touch with others going through the same thing  and we can help each other at this point in my life i strongly believe it is something i need in my life not just the online forums i visit when i get rough basically an accountability partner one that understands and u derstands you understand them close by so you can force each other to have a cup of coffee at mcdonalds or visit each other if all you can do is make it to the couch it sounds so damn cliche and its what we hear from people who have no idea what we deal with - but the last year ive found its true finding inner strength and not pouring my problems on others unless i absolutely have to has made me a stronger person it sure as shit isnt my medication changes if any of you are in this situation and need someone to talk to drop me a line im at the point in my life where i want to help others it makes you get out of yourself and how you dwell on how you feel it changes yourlife but it is so far from being easy believe me i understand those of you who will say  "he is just like everyone else" if you want to talk about the very slow steps ive taken drop me a line im teller you its been baby steps little baby steps over and over,0
oh yes that is me i dislike being forced my partner is rugby mad and often wants me to share in hes activities omw what a strain i feel like screaming out to him just leave me alone but its hes way of thinking thats what i need ,0
it swindled me in was in the house for almost 3 months straight i finally decided to fight back and take my kids out for a day of fun and ended up with a fractured elbow between the depression and anxiety ive been dealing with it took about a week to convince myself i could handle one day my kids had a blast so i guess it was worth it its been a bit tougher now that im dealing with so much pain and an itch that i cant scratch due to this cast ughhh i sometimes wish i could have an out of my body and mind experience just to be normal for a day and be able to cope with things like others do,0
i struggle with this daily i force myself to get up because of my 4 yr oldi fight hard for him wish i knew how to get better,0
i know i have the same problem and has been said sometimes i win and sometimes the depression wins its a real struggle,0
i struggle to fight my way through the depression i dont want it to totally take over so i fight hard  sometimes i win sometimes the depression wins but i will never stop fighting the hardest thing is fighting alone and having no one know or understand what your going through or even care,0
been like this for six months cost me a marriage i wish ppl would know how hard anxiety and depression cam be,1
i have bipolar and a lot of anxiety i have that feeling every morning lately even though im on my meds it just started out the blue i force myself up but cannot get motivated till at least 11am its horrible i wish i can just be normal !!! hope this does not go on too long as i cannot carry on like this,0
me too we just have to remember that there are times when we do feel "normal" even if its short lived and keep our perspective that this low time will pass either on its own or with a change in meds/ therapy also i for one have to give myself permission to rest and be unproductive for awhile because i know thats how my body operates ive been trying to go with the flow lol sometimes it works sometimes not at least we can take comfort in knowing that we are definitely not alone in our struggles❤️ god is here and so is facebook ,0
its that consuming dreaded feeling in the pit of your stomach & you honestly dont know if you can do it but if youre getting the right help itll give you the strength to push through it ,0
it ended my last relationship it was the best decision of my life though they were a very outgoing person i met when i was manic so we totally clicked then of course getting out of the relationship and someone trying to force me every damn day (which only made me feel worse about myself) was great for me i felt horrible about it for a year because she was a great person and had great intentions but i ended up feeling dependent on them again that made you feel less confident getting away from those who push you so hard is very important for your self confidence on topof that you are harming their life if you really do care about them letting them go is the best thing you can do for them even though it sucks you can then find ways to make yourself stronger on your own at your own pace i know thats not what you want to hear but the best therapist in the world will tell you flat out its bad for you and them only harms you both and stops both of you from having better lives drop me a line if you want to k ow my entire experience  ultimately i realize im just not supposed to be in a relationship  its just not healthy makes it harder on me and destroys the other persons life as well good luck !,0
the worst is when they think that youll feel better if you go somewhere to have a change of scenery that actually makes me worse ive learned to compromise if they are trying to get me out of bed to go somewhere say out to dinner ill get up and try to get ready if im still too anxious to go we end up ordering something in that way the other person gets my time and attention but i dont have to face the outside world this is just what works for me but compromise is always worth a try imo,0
difficult part for me is i have a partner with very similar issues as me but those issues manifest in very different ways me anxiety or depression means i shut off and get super implosive her needs to talk through everything and resolve every last detail which leads to very negative results from time to time ,1
just ask them to seriously back off explain yourself and hopefully they try to understand its been a struggle for me the last 2+ yrs and at least mom understands i cant do everything nowadays :/,0
my daughter is bipolar and ive seen first hand what it is doing to her i also having a hard time dealing with her she worries me because she has a 10 mth old son cant live with her either  im sad been trying to get her help and right medicine sad momma here,0
to define mania as being happy and energetic is inaccurate there are real problems with being irritable and unable to control your pressured speech when experiencing a mania its far from being happy and energetic,0
im sorry to burst any bubbles but the simple assumption that a bipolar diagnosis suddenly opens the recipient to sunshine and rainbows to offset the total misery of depression is a frankly obscene disservice,1
theres so many more options for you to chose from keep searching and dont give up! im on 3 different meds for anxiety and depression together they seem to all be doing the trick youll find something that works if you keep trying it took me a long time but how i feel now is worth the wait you are a beautiful soul please stay with us! ,1
a friend uses medically prescribed cbd for anxiety have you ever considered this?,1
i take abilify for bi polar it is used across the board for depression to bi polar it changed my days from paranoia depression always sleeping to have energy paranoia gone i do have a sleeping tablet for my bi polar maybe ask your doctor about abilify it changed my life,1
shon kennett that you for sharing your heart a true warrior in the mist of your suffering thats what you actually are the movement needs people like youits awesome i did try many years ago to kill myself and then 4 years ago i wanted to gas my self thank the lord jesus i didnt see i saw that bi polar isnt like living in a cave (the light only stays in the cave) but more its like a tunnel because there is always light at the end of the tunnelim going through a very stressful time but yet i see hope think its my faith that helps me to tell you the truth crazy thing is when im manic i called my self "the white princess of africa" i know it sounds crazy but in my bi polar mind this princess has a story to tell about her faith and she calls it africa because i live here and that is who i preach to when im in mania i always preach to african people here because just like me they struggle in povertyso i see where that pain is coming from because even thou my pain is different its the same i had therapy and the white princess is gone but it was a crazy fun scary time in my life thank god,0
this might sound odd but do you take a magnesium supplement? that makes a huge difference with my anxiety i take a combination calcium/magnesium/ vitamin d3 supplement and it helps a lot over the winter my anxiety levels were getting very high and it was almost becoming debilitating im already on a 4 med cocktail and didnt want to add more pills i started researching safe home remedies and discovered that magnesium deficiency symptoms are almost the same as anxiety thats when i realized that id stopped taking them (bottle ran out and i forgot to pick up another one) after a week back on the supplement my anxiety levels dropped so nice to not have 24/7 tremors and panic attacks,1
thats a shame here in oz you can go through a chemist etc a be hooked up for overnight study at home i have severe apnea and had no choice and had to get a loan for the machine,0
that effexor is horrible stuffif youre feeling like that th medicine isnt working turned me into a unfeeling zombie i got off it a d suffered brain shocks for a week,0
awe sweetie you have no clue how nice it was to see you the other day it made my day sorry i was abit weird and thankyou very much with the beautiful words i like alot of people on that page deal with alot of ups and downs and sometimes its a daily struggle to find something worth fighting for today was a rough day because of fathers day,0
lmao dear lord i have never heard of a gay man call themselves a homo lmao he isnt the jealous type and isnt worried but thankyou,0
there ya go keep your mind active pm me if youd like whenever youre anxious or lonely,0
thats a great thing!! has he ever helped relax you when youre feeling anxious? exercise is the best medicineidle hands,0
youre right pills wont cure itknowing that helps because you know to expect good days and bad my anxiety got so bad my dr gave me klonopin which does help but makes me so tired and sleepy i use it very sparingly,1
i have been on effexor for about 10 years and its mellowed out my depression and anxiety but like today i dont feel it mellowing anything out but i also know one pill isnt going to cure depression,1
actually in behavioural therapy you slowly work your way up to more and more exposure to things that cause anxiety while you are exposed to your anxiety causing trigger or situation your therapist helps you practice coping skills to deal with situation the better you get at coping and the more positive outcomes you have during these exercises the less anxiety you will feel combine this with the proper medication and it can make a world of difference,1
indeed someone who has no idea what they are doing and forcing you against your will is never okay! i was just saying that positive and monitored exposure is healthy this post kind of makes it sound like people should never face their anxiety idk just how i perceived it i guess,0
okay but therapy is something that the person with anxiety is willing to partake in there is consent to being gently forced into the situation that causes anxiety there is no consent in a friend or family member forcing you to do the thing despite you saying no and giving a valid reason of it screwing with anxiety,1
aint cured by avoiding it either all about getting the balance right and understanding why were anxious ✌️,0
ive lost 3 friends because they felt that no one could help them they gave up i can relate to them but dont want to give up i keep reminding myself of what i have in my life that keeps me going its definitely not easy it breaks my heart to think of their families who are struggling to understand why their loved one gave up i dont want that for my family i dont want to stop fighting despite how bad things are i know eventually ill have the help i need to live life without pain god bless all who struggle,0
is that confusing moment where life is perfect around you but deep inside your heart is breaking confused as to what is wrong with us why are we still not happy still not good enough to deserve happiness,0
youre not alone christine you have this board i know how you feel my family doesnt understand either i feel like they say "shell get over it" not knowing i would if i could there are many of us who suffer which unfortunatly horrible,0
i have the most problems with sleep too i take a sleeping medicine my mood stabilizer makes me sleepy and my doctor still proscribes xanax to help with my anxiety all that said the thing that has helped me most is listening to guided meditations as i go to sleep and practicing meditation during the day - even just being quiet for a certain amount of time and breathing slow and easy if you have iphone theres an app called meditation studio that i really like it cost like four dollars but theres no other "in app purchases",1
yes both of those happens when i have my anxiety attacks,1
anxiety can cause your throat to feel like its closing also go to the dr just in case it happens to me but im not on any medication,1
if you feel like your throat is closing up you may want to see a doctor you could be having an allergic reaction i found out i am allergic to latuda and vistaril both of them make my throat close up and hyperventilate it feels like a panic attack but its not,0
you should seek therapy before you do anything i went to therapy and learned ways to deal with anxiety and depression it helped a lot,1
when you get your panic attacks is there anything you can do to help calm yourself down (ie listen to music deep breathing etc)?,1
i try everything to overcome but nothing is working it works for only few time  the most irritating i feel is panic attack  i had never face this situation in my life,0
dont be afraid there is help,1
thank you meds were changed last thursday & i now have to take one mid day & im afraid i wont remember,1
welcome to my day the only difference is my only thoughts during the day (especially at a job i hatebut with no transportation to get another one)i am indecisive on the best way to make the pain end came to the realization the other day that no matter which method i deal withits going to hurt as much or worse than what ive been going through all my life i dont have an answerbut with the way it looks like the shtf with healthcare/safety neteven this may not have an answer for the pain question,0
this is my 3 rd day taking these and im getting restless legs and very agitated is this normal and will it go away ? x,0
upset stomach,0
op here: i spoke with my doctor and she said that i need to be working there already for me to have her fill out an ada (its a disability accommodation form which is what the company gave me) and i asked her if she read it because the first question was literally "if (name) is able to do these tasks without accommodation there is no need to fill out the remainder of the form) which then clears me to move forward with the application status what upsets me the most is that hr pressured me to disclose my mental disability despite that i said it wouldnt get in the way of work i could be working already,1
bipolar and anxiety were actually included on a application i just filled out for a job i checked prefer not ti answer im starting to wonder if my hospitalization when i was 17 was popping up im in il and tried to get a foid card and that popped up,1
this is such a huge mess if it werent for the fact that i need health insurance and a new car (i totaled mine) i would be looking elsewhere but im desperate and its within walking distance,0
i once had a psychological sort of test before hiring where they even asked you if you had suicidal thoughts lol and all sorts of strange questions so that they could know every aspect of you which in my opinion is nothing else but manipulation those results go to the employer even if they say its confidential haha nothing is confidential with big companies what were they going to do if i said i had big anxiety? treat me like a special case in case i got hired? wtf? anyway disclosing these or not for people with high anxiety at jobs where high interaction and almost constant pressure is present these various disorders are going to show themselves at times whether we like it or not you cant fake it all the time unfortunately haha anyway really sad case here and my point would be just dont be honest to the employers cause theyre only manipulators and can replace you in a second,0
the need to know that they wont exasserbate your condition or harm you if the job caused you harm theyd be liable if your doctor doesnt sign it because theyre worried then you shouldnt be working,1
someone i love very much exhibits some of these symptoms her freedom from anxiety is my greatest hope she deserves every happiness,0
and when you have anxiety panic attacks recycle complete meltdown looking from the outside-in and nothing you can do about get out of the area and then get calm down the best way you can without hurting yourself or others,1
watching your child struggle with it for as long as you can rememberits the worst having it myselfi know the struggle all too well,0
i agree with you i also hate to see my daughter struggle with it i hate the pain it causes me to have prayers to you and your child,1
so true i will sit there telling myself "just go no one cares no one is looking at you" however that sense of panic i get keeps my butt glued to my seat!,0
i hate that too i get so uncomfortable being stared down in public i have to force myself sometimes to do things like go to the bathroom because i know people will stare at me,0
being alone sucks and is scary,0
depression/anxietyseasonal depression would love to connect with others that really get the struggle,0
most people suffer in silence; too ashamed to ask for help do not judge a book by its cover,0
i battle it every day horrible sickness,0
you continue to struggle daily with bipolar illness and this really describes your life keep on with your therapist and your commitment for dbt you can live despite this illness until thru research there are better answers,0
i struggle all the time with this its so hard to live a normal life like this,0
sometimes yes you should be afraid of me im sorry to say,0
i dont agree with some of these like "dont take it personally" or "theres no reason to be afraid of me" if we dont want our own feeling invalidated we shouldnt do it to others been living with bpd a long time and ive lost people i love because it was too much for their own hearts to handle i dont fault them at all the majority is great though and i absolutely relate,0
sorry but thats not true theres a lot of people who; could be with the perfect partner and not feel good enough because of their own strugglesim one of those people that regardless i feel im never good enough being in a relationship doesnt "magically change that" however if you only doubt yourself when with someone and rarely ever do then yeah they arent good enough,0
for my depression and anxiety and the support of mental illness that run in my family love and peace all stay strong,0
i had the same situation i was introduced to a guy and found out he likes me i liked him too we went on a few dates but i was feeling horrible all i wanted to do was stay in bed and sleep all day i cancelled our last date because i couldnt get out of bed that was the day i was going to tell him what was going on havent talked to him since i tried contacting him to get back together but he didnt get back to me if they arent willing to take you for you they arent meant for you and its time to move on,0
i agree cameron harman if she cannot handle it you will know how she feels and can agree to keep an emotional distance between each other but you will not feel the need to actively avoid her on the other hand she may be willing to give it a go then you wont again have to actively avoid her do you know if she has noticed you avoiding her? dont you think she may take this to mean you really are not interested? everyone deserves some happiness dont screw it up for both of you,0
you could even write it in a letter (old school i know but it shows how much you care) when you hand it to her tell her that there are some things you wanted her to know but are hard for you to talk about the ball will be in her court then if she doesnt want to continue with the relationship dont let that get you down some people cant handle those of us with special needs because its not easy neither one of you would be a "bad person" if this happens on the other hand she may be open to going further with youthe unknowns and what-ifs of any situation causes us more stress than almost anything else god bless my friend!,0
it has been a long struggle for me when i finally got my diagnosis i was in my late 40s it took a few more years to get the right cocktail and even then the meds have had to be adjusted but i dont think i would go back the next biggest hurdle is to change my mindset things will not always be so negative i cannot live this way and the only way i can do that is within myself i can make the choice to be miserable or take steps to change how i look at life ive lived my life for 59 years being miserable it is time i changed that! i have an amazing support system that is helping me,0
yes it sucks pun intended its hard to take its humbling to be dependent and its a pain to remember and its scary to fear running out and on top of all that its expensive but medication keeps me stable and i feel that its worth it in the long run untreated my bipolar disorder made my life chaotic and unproductive not to mention terribly painful being sane is priceless and i try to be thankful that there is a treatment for my condition,1
this is true especialy for bipolar both therapy and meds work best i have bp and anxiety and have been able through years of therapy learn coaping stratgies and recognize when an episode is coming right now i am not on medication for either because the therapy has been sucessfull i still have issues sometimes still see my therapist and doctor to make sure i stay ok but ive been able respond in a healthy way and avoid trouble,1
rebecca sokol i never forget about that word that you say if you would have have diabetes i used to have a therapist told me that one day think about you had ibt and if you dont take your meds you will die sounds bad day i got so scared because they told me they can cut any part of my body so for many years now im taking my meds but i still feel bad because my daughter have the same illness and she doesnt want to take her medication and we dont have no more communication she lost all her friends she lost one of her job now shes on another job because she doesnt want to take meds but youre right we need to take our mets and think about we have diabetes god bless you sweetie goodnight,0
i dont know u well enough to tell u alot but im goin through the same thing like i was on different meds for bipolar depression and epilepsy but none of them worked so i stop taking them and im still struggling with it so i know what u mean,1
i struggle with depression alot if you need someone to talk or anyone does dont hesitate to message me im usually up late so even if its late shoot me a message ,0
kay honey you are not alone i know how impossible it is when you try to function like a normal person but your body just physically cant and you feel like shit physically which makes you more depressed which makes the pain worse and its this whole maddening cycle of seemingly endless defeat i know i am right here in this darkness with you when you have to battle your mind and body just to achieve the simplest tasks things other people would never even think twice about but you are still valid theres still hope bc theres shit that can be done to make it better to make it manageable just one step at a time one obstacle at a time one diagnosis/treatment plan at a time being admitted is a great first step in achieving that esp if you feel like you may harm yourself you can be in a safe place  and assess all of your issues with a team of professionals to comeup with a comprehensive plan to treat body and mind and if they dont have the proper specialist in hand im sure someone there would be able to refer you to someone or point you in the right direction and i know it seems scary but a 72hr hold really isnt that bad its actually really helpful and staying longer can ensure youre regulated properly on all the right meds and the drs can make sure no side effects and everything is good and usually theres a social worker who can talk to you about your living arrangements and if they are okay/safe work/disability support groups and even bridging the gap with your family ive been through this particular wringer a few times and you really do come out better in the end its like creating a new solid foundation to build a new better life and you on with the proper support in place bc youre not alone and you dont ever have to be theres a whole swarm of people waiting to help you at your local hospital love and were all here  im here we gotchu please i urge you to consider going in immediately and self admitting if youre having suicidal ideations even if youre not having those thoughts at the moment  its still a good idea to go in just bc you can have a sense of peace around you be still for a few days to regroup you can address all of your issues both mental and physical with the drs get meds sorted out and just stabilize its such a good place to regroup for moving forward anyway sorry for babbling on i just hope youre okay honey  i want you to okay and safe and well you can msg me if you want ,0
thank you i needed to hear this i will consider this step a lot more seriously now but i want to try fighting a bit more on my own just for a bit longer i want to see if i can get through but i wont hesitate if it gets that bad again thank you,0
i suffer with ptsd anxiety depression and bipolar for over 17 years now i have been battling since then i want to share my newest ink loving your tattoo thanks for sharing,1
i am one of those battling with anxiety disorder but i am coping because i am aware now,1
i have depressionanxiety and panic disorderi have one tattoo that says stay strong and never give up and another that says my story isnt over yet ;,1
i am alone as i go through my days with this awful deasese i fight n fight but i feel know one caes nor does anyone love me the world is so cold n lonely who to turn to becuz when i turn there is know one so i hold my head down n cry as i know im nothing i am worthless i struggle n struggle but im only me,0
i have been off my meds since november i know i need to get back on them but i am so afraid of the reaction i have been experiencing to them i am bipolar with ptsd i have been on meds for 32 years at first the meds seem to work great but eventually i start hallucinating losing sleep or cycling thru mania to psychosis i talk to my drs about these issues but usually they just prescribe another med that supposedly treats the side effect i also have severe ra and progressive ms trying to maintain both physical and mental health is overwhelming i know i need to get back on some meds for my mental issues but i am not very hopeful that they will help any advice or new meds that might help?,1
im on methadone 2 different antidepressants a mood stabilizer and a pill that helps with the body temperature side effects of the methadone all that and i still get depressed anxious moody and drug cravings i wish i could take a month off of life and raising 3 kids to get off of all that but i cant right now the mess help me to continue on with life and my responsibilities but i hope some day im the near future i can be medication free,1
im on 7 neds for severe bipolar one anxiety and adhd it makes me so thankful to have an awesome psyc dr who really cares and helps me without the mess id live in hospitals,0
when an episode hits me i get down on the fact i have to take pills to be "almost" normal but i am grateful that i can pick through my thoughts 80% of the time and when i cant its bad so i am grateful for my meds im also ptsd bipolar 1 and anxiety i dont miss the nightmares and terrors so i tell myself if i was asthmatic i wouldnt be ashamed to have my inhaler so why do i need to be ashamed of meds that help my brain disease? another way to look at it,1
i take 3 different types of medications for anxiety/depression i hate the fact that i rely on them to feel normal but then i think of the alternative and im grateful to have found medication that works for me!,1
use to happen to me all the time when i just got over a really long manic episode it wore off the more stable i became it was frustrating and scary good luck just be patient with yourself,1
i got bipolar disorder 2 and ptsd and i dont know lately whats going on with me i used to be very friendly looking for friends always give opportunity to people to be in my life but right now i really dont want to socialize at all i go to the street and speak with everyone and treat everybody good but when its about people asking me for my phone i start lying to them because i dont want to have friends out there i just realized that all the time make people and they know what i have or have to tell them what i have right away they start treating me differently and im getting tired about then i born by myself and im bored with it tween why should i have to care about what other things about me all the way i am i prefer to be alone even man im sick about it what i leave in the bronx new york they call womans crazy if they know you got bipolar they dont have respect and i dont have time to get upset i prefer to be alone for happy,0
i actually recently heard that you can have ptsd w dissociative features ive had this happen if you dont remember something and are worried about it if you feel comfortable ask about what happened could help ease your mind a little,0
one thing that helped with my social anxiety was to pick out one thing a person said to follow up on or ask about i fear the awkward silences and pauses i also like using "positive sentence starters" like "oh really? thats so awesome" or "wow i really like that" i dont experience blackouts the way youre describing but i do often find i talk in circles when im anxious,0
i will constantly black out mid conversation or forget what i just finished saying it gets worse when my anxiety is triggered which will always trigger my agoraphobia,0
unfortunately im not sure what to tell you about your housing situation i dont know where you live and if social services will help but if your really worried about your housing situation maybe you can try and get into a shelter it may not be ideal but its better than being homeless for the most part i know that sounds like bad advice and im sorry i did live in two shelters myself i didnt enjoy it but i did take steps to better myself there and hopefully you can too and as far as the relationship goes maybe you can talk with your ex boyfriend/friend and see if he is still willing to give you emotional/social support i know its hard because one or both of you may still have feelings but it might be worth a shot but if your too nervous to do that you can reach out to me im a great listener and i really like to make people feel better and open to me just some food for thought i wont be offended if you dont want to,0
thank you monica i was able to talk with the people where i am and all is good im just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else has treated me that i was afraid they would do the same thing as far as the dating thing i wanted to talk about he didnt leaving me to figure it out by myself thursday seemed to be back to our old friendship; but in a new better fresh way with him being more ready to start dating ive just been frustrated in the waiting and trying to cope with the pain of losing my friend when ive had alot going on and need social support,0
in reading this i realized again how lucky i was when i became so ill my employer? wanted me to get better i put a huge strain on my co workers and they worked tirelessly to accommodate me i finally gave up and quitsome people arent so lucky im sorry for that in your case also i had a therapist that knew exactly what to do again extremely lucky my dr the nurses all of them there are programs like respite or maybe if you can trade housekeeping for a room or caregiver until you find your way s security/disability im quite sure you werent asking anyone to solve your problems its hard sometimes when a person is overwhelmed to be so perfect in explaining what they need from others happens to me all the time i gave up the dating world a long time ago its to difficult for me personally im not even close to being ready for that for you may be different probly not the best when you meet in treatment so many intense emotions being shared can trick you into thinking its love (not impossible tho) i think they call it trauma bonding also exercising doesnt help everybody keep asking for help and youll find something that works for you,0
thank you heather you have no idea how much i feel loved reading this right now i was able to talk with the people where i am and all is good im just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else has treated me that i was afraid they would do the same thing as far as the job i knew the new one was a problem and had to go because my health is more important; so i quit my therapist is wonderful and i do the work outside sessions therapists have said i actually process too much as for the dating situation thursday seemed to be back to our old friendship; but in a new better fresh way with him being more ready ive just been frustrated in the waiting and trying to cope with the pain of losing my friend when ive had alot going on and need social support my counselor has actually not discouraged me from never being in a relationship but to be cautious and let it happen when i am in a good place and willing to work at it he thinks the support would be good for me,0
i think your being to hard on yourself stay in treatment and keep trying w the meds focus on you and your recovery stop worrying about everything and everyone else take a deep breath exercise get out of bed for awhile you can always go back to bed but i fins if i shower and get ready for the day i feel much betterjust take some me time your worth it hang in there i know first hand its not easy but u can only change you,0
stephanie thank you for again reminding me that i am sick unfortunately the rest of life doesnt stop just because of an illness and personally i want to overcome it which means learning to cope with problems not excusing them i was specifically asking for help on the housing relationship and dating situation which i admitted my responsibility of bad thinking and where it was coming from continuing to ignore problems that include other people only makes them worse i didnt need to be told i was worrying about everyone else when i was actually worrying about myself being homeless and alone wondering if you actually read what i wrote? at least you got me working on my junk again! now if only i can figure out how to face it! ,0
for many who suffer from anxiety issues half of the ideas on this list cause anxiety & the rest are near impossible when anxious!,1
trouble is when you feel anxious almost all of those things are impossible to do anyway!!!,0
go on the internet increases my anxiety,1
not just that it becomes an addiction after awhile i do it all the time then i find myself buying things i dont really need then realizing your broke causes more anxiety,1
i was just going to post shopping makes me more anxious,0
that was really good thats like a lesson to learn all my family never want to deal with me my bipolar 2 we major depression when my mother died i was just 11 and a half so that my living hell nah my two children has the same thing and me and my daughter can live together shes 21 its really hard and painful my son has autism we bipolar right now hes at the hospital he got days he cant control himself but every one thing that i dont have nothing in my community because i dont act aggressive the days i dont feel good i stay home or i go right away to my psychiatric increase or remove medicine then im working for me and they give me new medications ive been like that all my life also i used to have adhd right now is getting to me like today i have surgery my hands and i dont even hear the phone ringing my daughter say how you doing how is the surgery i only got a couple friends not too many anymore and they alway from this country but they got me support and that whats up and a lot of people my community my doctors and i really appreciate that but lately ive been thinking about what im doing this were leaving with this illness i feel guilty like i did something wrong my life and then i start thinking i never been bad in my life im always do the right thing and always help others and im a happy person we others make everyone happy and im the last what am i doing wrong why i have this newness and now my two children thats so sometimes say i want to jump in a river or something so my diet be helpful lately im getting tired about this world,0
i can totally relate ive lost so many friends and have pushed so many friends away because of the depression or the manic episodes where i get easily irritated no one gets it but a few of my friends who have similar mental illnesses its so tough to explain to someone who doesnt get it i cant just shut it off itll never go away even with all the medication and therapy ive had it still remains there just waiting to pop up again and granted the medicines help and therapy helps but nothing can stop it completely and youre just so stuck trying to fight it off the best you can,0
hopefully she will get better and not worse i wish i had been on anti anxiety meds when i was a teenager and in college because anxiety and panic attacks are crippling and a lot of problems come from severe anxiety as a young person,1
all i can say that bye losing a girlfriend recently dont worry she didnt die she simply left me since that time including your truly heartbreaking story i now understand so much more believe me when i say to you thankyou and bless you,0
mine is different but i relate i go from suicidal to euphoric when i am level (if you can call any bipolar level!) my mind still races sometimes so much i cant sleep for days when i am low i hide behind fake smiles and try not to go out much in my manic stage i talk incessantly and i am sure some want me to shut up i cant help it i get anxiety and become agoraphobic for a while i dont manage stress well i cry a lot and scream when it all gets too much i can now tell what most of my triggers are and have a great network and coping strategies i wasnt diagnosed until my 30s and still havent got a number i do get very upset with my head as i have horrible thoughts unfortunately i am also an empath so anything bad happening to others affects me a lot i cope i get through each day and sometimes i shut down thats life for me,0
they used to call it manic depression when i was young and didnt understand it well i have a foster nephew who is aggressive and he has been diagnosed as bp4 its a horrible disease and can be crippling for young people it is so hard when your friends dont "get" your moods i hope you find your safe place and coping mechanisms writing is one of mine and i have 4 cats and 4 dogs they help me on my down times bless you sweety you have a struggle ahead but we have people who will listen xxx,0
that is an amazing description and spot on for me i used to explain the confusion as being placed in a maze having the lights shut off and then being told you have 3 seconds to get out before you die its utter chaos and panic that at times cant be controlled even with medication therapy and coping techniques thank you for sharing!!!,0
i always say that dealing with my bp2 and anxiety is like fighting a three-headed beast you never know where to start fighting,0
i found it helpful to write down each day how i felt how my anxiety was how my depression was then take it into your doctor with you so you can explain better how you have been feeling dont give up,1
i have jars and jars of colored sea glass it turned out to be quite a healthy obsession as it got me out of the house into the fresh air and walking every day at low tide i walked around the lake looking for colored glass that the tides had washed up i am sure people thought i was nuts (pardon the pun) i did it until we had to move from the area and i do miss it however i have lovely jars that shine in the sunlight and my memories of enjoyment with this obsession we can look for ways to work with rather than against who we are,0
i think i just a need to fill something that cant be satisfied i am a man of god so i say this confidently and as a person that struggles with mental illness that once you come to terms that earthly possessions and desires will never satisfy a person with well controlled med regime and a prayerful and god seeking life you can overcome the feeling of emptiness,0
i went through the exact same thing i still have the clutter but i dont stress about it in a way it reminds me how i was when i was manic and to be more cautious about spending also reading the bible and prayer have been a lot of help along with meds,1
bipolar= reactions then thoughts most people think things through then react makes the end result a more logical act instead of an oh shit now what! vert poor at choice making have taken anti psych meds anti depression crap everything from zoloft to lithium to capacitance geoden zyprexa you name it depacote zyprexa ( fat pills) i gained so much weight and experienced a whole new level of depression that led to agoraphobia seemed i was just getting worsebipolar is not easy to write a script for there is nothing made for it so they use dris ade for other ailmentsits all hit and miss now i am on latuda ( mood stabilizer) topiramate ( controls seizures which i dont have )propranolol ( high blood pressure meds i dont have high blood pressure but i shake from the other drugs so it helps with that) prazosin (also high blood pressure med but it als controls the nightmares) this cocktail took me 5 years of trial and error but seems to do the trick have patience we are all unique and for each one of us our cocktail will be unique too keep the faith and embrace your ability and outlook on life so different from the norm never a dull moment,1
i was on clozaphine if anyone offered latuda its new in uk just being used horrible drug made me so sick,0
melanie renee im struggling here lately and heres to hoping you are getting through okay!!!,0
ive been struggling too im driving myself crazy lets hope we can get out of this funk!,0
do not worry as min has done the damage to me just how she wanted and meeting on monday will make her really happy as then put one word or minute wrong iam gone she has destroyed me ad she will make it look like iam mentally unfit to do the job,0
to leave can be very hard and it can be for some time whatever you do be safe first and then surround yourself with people who will help you be strong and go through the process of becoming separate in your mind from him you can love someone and not be with them you can pray for him and not let him be able to harm you any more god is good pray and read comforting bible verses go to church for comfort and to get strong and close to goddont be afraid but be strong~ and be safe,0
im going through the same thing finding out about his affairs triggered a horrible manic episode which scared away all my friends so now its just him that i have i really feel for you going through this but its also nice to not feel like the only one,0
sending love and this advice your way you are strong and as hard as things are life can and will get better and be beautiful and amazing as someone with anxiety/depression let me tell you that sometimes when youre in a bad place you get the blinders put on you that only let you see the bad things and only see hardship and sadness in your future but after time work and love you can and will be able to take those blinders off and see the wonderful parts of life again ❤️ make the decision that will let you be in an environment where you can heal sending love ❤️,0
i think the fear of "not having anywhere else to go" is so often a sort of crutch that is used to stay in an abusive relationship i think you need to take that leap and end it - the rest will get figured out and i think that youll find its less scary and less impossible than it seems sending hugs and courage to you <3,0
the longer you stay the harder it will be to eventually leave do a little research on "gas lighting" its a common way for one person to convince another that its all in their head then you feel like you are crazy that is their plan know that approximately 90% of women involved in a toxic relationship will die by the hands of their abuser at first i thought that number must be exaggerated the longer i stayed the worse it got i soon was fighting for my life on a daily basis dont beat yourself up if you arent successful in leaving multiple times the ugly truth is that the average person in an abusive relationship takes 7 times of leaving & coming back before they break free for good i was deathly afraid of my ex husband was afraid to tell anyone it sounds a lot like this abuser suffers from narcissistic personality disorder people with narcissistic personality disorder are impossible to fix this is because they dont think they have a problem the best thing to do is hoard as much money (cash) as possible start making a plan now to get away the best & only way to free yourself from a person with npd is to have no contact with the person you deserve better the cheating wont stop get out as soon as you can good luck to you dear if you need to talk to someone that has been in your shoes i welcome you to message me be good to yourself,0
i have it started off ok but as it just stops the physical symptoms i found it was no longer working for me may have given me depression as a side effect the dr said i could choose whether to continue or not so now just take it when a panic attack comes on works pretty quickly to stop them,1
i started taking it 4 weeks ago have had only one pad panic attack thats it,1
i was started on it it did nothing for my anxiety i still had severe anxiety attacks while i was on it and was switched to xanax and finally got some relief,1
worked well for me but nothing on diazepam but was took off of that after i needed 10mg+ to calm a mild panic attack and that would then cause me to crash and being a single mum it wasnt good i was on 80mg twice daily and it helped take the edge off,1
helps a bit with physical symptoms but not great for full blown panic attack or when anxiety symptoms already started,1
didnt work for me made my anxiety worse,1
yes started low & increase to three times a day i have found with perseverance that side effects passed & it takes keeps day to day anxiety controllable need something extra on challenging days though,1
i have it and find it calm me down works pretty quickly during for me for anxiety attacks ,1
im on it at the moment twice a day still have anxiety but it has calmed it down havent noticed any side effects,0
its good that you are seeking help those memories/ flashbacks/feelings are not easy to talk about you might try lining up some trusted friends/family to help you if you feel uneasy usually its a week or so until the next appointment make a plan call someone to come sit with you talk to you on the phoneonce youve settled in to "how it works" it should get a little better if you get on youtube and searchwhat to do after a therapy session it should give you some mental health tipsonly look at the ones with licensed therapists or professionals,0
i feel like talking about it helps you more i dont even have to talk about anymore my therapies at soca my daily basic problems because it was really good to talk about we people they know my abuser and the more painful worse when my family didnt care even they know there was my brother hes a doctor a dental dr and everybody knows him as a serious man in the community but because my family didnt support me he get away with but its fine for me because now im leaving a better life but people that i wanted to understand and believe what im saying it was the witnesses that couldnt say nothing before and they support me not my family will people for my town they told me they know whats going on but they were so scared about this guy because he was the president of my country really close friend and dominican republic if you do something wrong you could kill nobody cares about it thats what im coming from i never went back to my country for almost 19 years lets talk about it with your therapist or anyone that is in the same situation is really good and help you a lot my god bless everyone of you to being abused,0
in my experience i was against opening the can of worms and very frightened about facing my demons from the past but now five years on from opening up and twenty five years on from the major issue i know it had to happen never dealing with the issue properly means it just smoulders just below the surface never going away never being properly addressed yes its tough yes its painful but i believe we cant truly move on and build a future until the issues have been faced head on the counsellor or therapist will be trained empathic and non judgemental they will gently help you through the whole process together until you can come to be able to process the difficult issues effectively so you can properly rebuild and regain your life you dont deserve to suffer anymore x,0
sometimes we can be so afraid of things "getting worse" that we dont do the things that can help us get better -- the problem with ignoring trauma is what we wont deal with doesnt go away it will only make things worse and worse over time you can do this!,0
would you look at that another phobia to top my existing ones ,0
truly didnt realize how horrible bi polar is i dont have it but my ex does good news is last i heard shes with a great guy stay healthy kat love always x,0
scary,0
i have all ready said to much and now i am going to try and keep my mouth shut and see which works for me the best crying and yelling ruined my 17 year relationship and we are trying to to work on fixing it and counsling is helping but i feel better not yelling and sceaming everytime i am upset so maybe keeping my mouth shut will work for me i hope !!!! wish me good luck,1
wisdom and knowledge are two different things i am fighting with all my heart it the mind who is against me my feelings are scary even for me i must hide them otherwise i will scare people horribly,0
today went good although i avoided ppl/family to get thru with no explosions or break downs 2 steps forward 3 back but i am happy i wasnt in bed or stuffing my emotions w food,0
exact same thing i was hospitalized twice and they put me on leave during the second hospital stay and said if i couldnt get it together in a month they would have to fire me i was too ashamed to go back to that job if i was going to be treated in that manner so i quit i couldnt find another job for over 4 months and now we are getting evicted from our apartment due to affiliated late rent payments,0
it happens covertly to me all the time "normal" people say suicide is cowardly while they themselves are cowards in their terrors of the brave and unique individuals that we are,0
dont worry ladies i have just booted her from the page she wont be back ❤ ~dani,0
ive been fired for being in hospital with kidney stones and having a week off ive also been let go for having a panic attack induced by trauma i didnt know i had in both cases the employer didnt care enough to say get yourself better take their concern as a gift and use that gift to work on your mental health,1
if they have you on medical leave and you will be paid then i would take this as a blessing dont stress on it but rather take this time for you and get better,1
im 22 the mother of 2 autistic kids under the age of 7 and i have bpd bipolar and clinical depression i wasnt forced on leave but i am on medical leave right now and honestly its the best thing thats helped me so far if you feel the need to go out and work id look around for cash jobs like yard maintenance or stuff like that and if you find yourself on a day you cant get out of bed well stay in bed guilt free dont stress about not being at work (i know its hard as fuck) but try and take it as a break from reality and responsibilities and focus your energy on healing yourself,1
my heart goes out to you nothing is more bad than your daughter telling you that you scare her this was after fighting with my ex because he said he would pay for my meds then changed his mindwell i sorted that out you have bad days dont crucify your self forgive your selftell your self that you love your self im also sick of fighting just to make it through the day but the positivity in me wont allow me to give upso darling you cant give up too xxx,0
i dont know what advice will help but know that youre not alone! we all know struggles like these and most of us would hug you if we could hang in there try to do something for you!,0
for him and the guilt apologize say its not his fault honestly its not yours either its just the emotional roller coaster you go on when he asks what he can do that will help (because he loves you and our partners always want to fix it even if there is nothing they can do) say something simple say him being there and just listening helps (because it does sometimes) say sometimes you will just need a hug so you can cry (because you will) but if you are in a space where you cant be hugged its not anything he should take offense of its just sometimes its too much stimulation and anything extra can make it worse is there anything he can help with that might help with some of the stress you are feeling?just every day things? maybe you need some extra hugs? maybe you need just a moment where you are able to lie in his arms and just read or something? maybe he could help with some chores (not sure of the dynamics of the household you are in)? maybe you guys could go out on a walk together somewhere where there wont be a lot of people and it can just be you two and maybe you dog or kids (if you have any) a simple nature trail can do wonders if you just get away from everything even for like 30 minutes its not huge things but it can help it wont just help you but it will help him feel better because he will feel like hes doing something to help you because thats all he wants its just sometimes those we live with dont realize they cant fix it and it doesnt necessarily need to be fixed (though god we wish it could be) but just some simple things can relieve the pressure so much i am hoping things even out for you,0
remember you are not alone sometimes it just takes a little searching to find someone who understands and will help you and listen with no judgement remember you are a warrior that though there seems to be more bad days than good those good days are going to be brighter and better than anyone else in the world has because we warriors fight harder for those good days we feel them stronger you are a beautiful person take a breath breathe in relaxation and relax the stress as you breathe out you deserve the brightness so fight that dark away!,0
i have to use a fan all year round summer sometimes i even wet shirt and sleep in a wet shirt sounds horrible but i do what i have to do i have been told it is menopause but still have them after hormones,0
i take effexor and that is one of the side effects i have to use a fan it was horrible for me last night when we lost power!,1
never be ashamed ive been fighting bipolar and anxiety since 1st grade and got diagnosed with it a couple years ago the best thing you can do is get help i waited too long to get myself help and it affected my life my relationships friendships you name it so i highly recommend getting help asap definitely see a psychiatrist and request cognitive behavioral therapy they work wonders!,1
i have not been in this situation so i cannot recomend anything definative my only words areif youcan see a good therapist to work you through this find a good lawyer to help your legal road ahead find a therapist for your daughter to get her through this as well do not beat yourself up over the little things like dishes and housework if you have family or friends near by see if they would be willing to help out these are little things and not worht stressing over too mcuh (if your children are old enough enlist them to help some of my fondest childhood memories are contributing to the home and helping mom clean house after saturday morning cartoons) when able speak with your doctor about any and all medicine concernsyou may even need to think about a psychologist for this (i never had good things with paxil but diffrent meds work for diffrent people and keep that in mind) and most importantly! you are an amazing woman and strong mother for protecting your children!!!!! do not sell yourself short on that and do not sell your children short on any second guesses or wishfull thinking times are tought but they will get better; thought it may take a while hang in there (also) being late for work dragging through day by day fighting to get up in the morningthese are understandable youve just gone through a shock again if you can therapist other than that give yourself permission to have the bad days it happens even to the best of us talk to your employer about the being late if it is an issue you dont have to get into details but ive found most are pretty understanding when going through traumatic life occurances,1
yes i co-sign this when you have extreme stress you may need a medication change or some type of adjustment sending you lots of love and light,1
sorry i have bipolar disorder and severe anxiety with depression which is a chemical imbalance that i was born with soooo i do need medicine and i feel for this persons situation,1
hirap po pala ng anxiety ate,1
yung panic phobia ,0
you know what is worstwhen you trust someone enough to talk about you struggle and they simply reply "there are far more worst things in the world than what you are suffering from get over it dont act like a child!" and then there is than tone in their voice and look in their face that are telling you that "you are doing all these just for attention and you are lazy" right now i am not using any medication but i feel like i am getting stupider day by day i forget most simple tasks like changing my clothes when i want to go out side or i cant tell if i am wearing a sunglasses or notmy head spins sometimes when i wake up i feel pressure in my brain sometimesi am confused most of the times,0
keep you& kids safe first you may also be if it from counseling if something happens to you or your children  you run the risk of losing them you can still try and helpfrom a distance until he decides to really get help,1
you are in a difficult situation and that is you are a person who is being mistreating you your husband is probably fearful of going to see a therapist as it is admitting that he actually has a problem there is also the fact that you need to protect yourself and your children if you do leave him again perhaps it may be a good idea not to go back until he has seen someone otherwise you will be going round in circles and there will be no resolution i am sure youve thought of this yourself and i am sure you go back because of persuasion and the fact that you love him things will only improve when he has seen someone and received some help i hope this helps you,0
i am in a some what similar situation i left someone i care about a lot but it just got to the point were the relationship was destroying me and my life she is currently hospitalised as cruel as it sounds its given me calm and time to repair financial damage but the amount guilt is unreal i really do not know what else to do for her she has 2 kids from previous relationship that are now with the dad shes run up serious debts at the same time as emotionally (and occasionally physically) ripping me to pieces appreciate theres no benefit to you but i can relate to a degree,0
i would get a restraining order if he is abusive and make a request to the court that he seeks therapy and is on his medication before he can come home and has proof of completion before you divorce if he doesnt then consider it also prayer helps forgive him thats for you the more u are holding grudges and are bitter the more the therapy wont work also get him the book bipolar for dummies make a family plan how to be a support system make sure he knows that his children are predisposed to bipolar disorder bc he has it but if the kids arent showing symptoms they can reduce the chances of showing symptoms by reducing stress in the environment something is stressing him out and it needs sto be addressed in a calm manner before his children are effected permanently by this toxic environment,1
yes totally half of my own family just doesnt understand how hard it is 2 deal with this crap on a daily basis they just gave up on me and im so tired of being tired but especially when u already feel scared and alone all the time then your own family gives up on u,0
i suffer from anxiety and i dont want to die i just feel like i hate this existence meaning everything feels so empty so monotonous everyday same crap work/ home/ chores / errands etc having to deal with drama and problems all of that people are so selfish and cruel i hate it! i gets me down like why is life so boring and such a drag?? im not sure if im depressed but i know i lack fulfillment everything is just blah and meh nothing exciting just one day after another i want more out of life than this we have one life why waste it working until im dead?,0
this has been on my mind quite a bit for the last several months my elderly roommate is catholic and elderly dont want her to find me with her husband dying three years agoif i put a bag over my head or slice my throat/wrists having lost my vehicle because of a blown transmission and having to ride a bicycle to work without stroking out i think about letting a car hit mebut wouldnt want someone to face that guilt the rest of their lives i look at my job pumping gas at a grocery store and wondering how the hell i got to this point and if i can make enough to make it part-time when no one else will interview me being a doctor who fan (knowing hes a character on a tv show)i wish he were real and to take me on one trip onlynever to come back to this planet/time/place where people would want me around and to love me where ive never been loved before no matter what i hearno one would miss mesince i know no oneexcept for my roommate and her dog,0
i get like this badly in the winter and mildly around my period its horrible,0
unfortunately all too often it is such a horrible feeling and i can never make it go away :(,0
so much going on in personal relationships financial situation feelings of " theyd be better off without me to worry about" how do you deal the best way for someone to heal who is youre nearest & dearest and your last reason for being alive without destroying their future:? :( ,0
yes i have been there alot and through out my life  i was always self harming  wanted to die  i even took it to the extent to overdose on some pill s for anxiety but u kno w what if u get the right help ur thoughts will clear your anxiety will slowly down but seek help first,1
i am going through a major depressive episode right now things in my personal life have blown up and i dont know what to believe anymore for me i have begun to disassociate i find myself just sitting and then my whole body feels just huge bigger and bigger cant feel a thing it is so scary i worry some day i wont be able to bring myself out of it im trying so hard right now,0
all the time!!! and when you try to tell someone that they get scared and think youre thinking suicide but you just want a break from yourself and all the mental baggage,0
all the time its like my entire life is a battle i have a wonderful hubby but then i feel so guilty why should he suffer?? i have a wonderful son and a lovely daughter in law i know i should feel thankful but i feel like i drag everyone into this dark space,0
i feel that well more or less he doesnt understand it like yesterday i started crying and it makes him feel helpless because he couldnt help me which makes him feel inadequate,0
i feel this way also it seems so unfair that my husband has to be strong for me i feel so guilty it is an endless cycle,0
and it kind of makes you feel like a crappy person when you think if others in the world who dont have a family or home or ecti think its best to know we all have our own struggles either emotional physical mental spiritual we all have something going on and its best to accept it especially with anxiety just sat you know this is a messed up feeling but just because its today doesnt mean itll be tomorrow,0
i only like it because i can relate like life could be so much worse and i actually have a nice life and amazing loved ones so why do i feel this wayand it really does make you feel guilty,0
i was never a religious person at all i mean i believed something was there but didnt know what and then i got appendicitis granted not the same thing as that and after that i have just been so anxious and i feel like god maybe used that experience to draw me closer to him because i started praying and asking for himi havent prayed in a while though and feel rather guilty about it,0
latelly ive been in this kind of state of mind im not emotionally strong and if something goes bad my anxiety starts killing me day by day and my toughts of wanting do disapear and not exist emerges its sad and horrible but i know it will pass today i had an anxiety attack and all i wanted was to isolate myself and disapear *sorry my english* big hug warriors ♡,0
sweetie dont worry english is perfectly fine trust me when people try to correct me over here i dont pay no mind i used to get mad but not anymore,1
id sit here and say how sorry i am for you but that would do you a disservice this is your life the hand has been dealt its time to call and show your cards thats the thing though show others your hand talk about what hurts defining your feelings is difficult im sure but you can describe the emptiness the loneliness and im not just talking about a therapist tell everyone in your life i know how terrifying that prospect can be but just think about it for a moment you live with fear every day fear of your own thoughts your urges or simply interacting with others the fear here is being judged but even if you were would that really be worse? theres a saying almost a mantra for us "no one is harder on me than me" so really what damage can telling people how much your suffering and how little control you have? you torture yourself far more than any hurtful judgmental comments however maybe just maybe youll find someone who gets it maybe your support system will grow the people who get your pain but instead of telling you to get out of bed and deal with it they lie down next to you and hold you sometimes love and support can be just as effective as meds,0
my cousin suffers from depression and when her attacks begins she texts me and i rush to her house even her husband cant comfort her she told me i am all her hope (no pressure) and i can only understand her i am kind of ok with this part of story but when i feel really bad and sunk into darkness of my thoughts and depression and am gasping for a tiny comfort then anxiety hits mead i text her she replies a day after or so asking if i am ok! why i cant do the same? maybe i am not compassionate as i think i am maybe i am just a selfish idiot who feel better helping others and is using that to feel good and are pretending that is good person? oh my mind is so complicated and are always up and runing creating ideas and theories i feel like it is trying so hard to explain everything that most of the times is mistaken i am too tired of thinking but i cant make it stop! i have a secret that is killing me down and it is that i am homosexual and no one knowsi feel lonely and really in pain mental and physical i also have a nasty ibs that wont leave me alone sometimes i think my problems are too complicated to be solved 1 by 1 i need a solution that can help me to start with a clean new state,0
i can so relate to how nemo is feeling right its been a few weeks and the constant stress and lack of support doesnt help,1
i have been struggling myself lately heres my best advice to you no matter what just try just try to get out of bed and meet with the sun take your d vitamins and fish oil if you get up and you just cant today its okay try again tomorrow just try i personally askee people to keep their negative feeling and thoughts to themselves i told myself to not speak negative even its hard but it helps,0

dishes laundry mop do whatever u can to alieve any outside stressors so that she can deal with the spiral head on,0

bipolar/depression/anxiety open page when you post images like this can you please find ones big enough so they dont look so blurry? most of the images i see from this page are really blurry i think because the original images are so small thanks!,1
your not! im down really low right now too because of my oldest kids they always like to get me upset and stress me out and my anxiety just goes crazy!,0
thats a tough one sweetheart if you are over 18 you only need your parents support not permission you should never have been given an intern only in the first place they work under the supervision of licensed personel try to obtain information on the therapists they have and request the one you want you may have to go through a few to find the right fit only you will know that -- if you feel uncomfortable unsafe in any discussions or see or feel no improvement you can talk with your therapist or dr about the need for hospitalization if you feel time is of the essence check yourself in they will usually begin and monitor any medications you may need as well as counseling and support from others like you dont be afraid also consider all the options in your area for treatment if you are not 18 you need someone to talk to your parents for you as it doesnt appear that they see the importance of your receiving treatment maybe you have a school counselor teacher or another family member who can speak on your behalf in my experience clergy and psychological treatment do not mix well they are separate faith is very important i cannot express enough how vital early intervention is to recovery!!!! the older you get the harder it will be whatever you do dont give up on yourself or others i wish you the very best good luck!,0

i do not have bpd (i was diagnosed bipolar 2 with many many other things) but i have a partner who may have it (though he lives somewhere currently where they have a horrible mental health system as are really bad at diagnosing so we arent positive) there are some types of meds that help mood stabilizers are supposedly the select few that can cause some relief with bpd but i definitely recommend dbt and therapy if you dont already but until you can do it there are a lot of things you can do for yourself for now find things that help you obsess in a positive way i also write but i write not only about what i feel but in my novels(which helps be obsess productively) i also have my animals which need constant care every day and i rehab a lot of animals so that helps a lot with giving me something i am constantly researching about them because i enjoy it there are many other things you can do just for every day stuff walking or just any exercise yoga has been an extreme help for me just finding what works for you is really really important ^^,1
one thing to remember is that youre not lazy when i got to a point where i just couldnt do simple tasks anymore i called myself lazy and just felt worse and worse about myself only when i found the right meds (or the right meds for now) did i realize how much better and how much different i felt i realized that i hadnt been lazy and that it was the illness attacking me with all it had i realized that there was a difference between being sick (with the flu etc) and having a horrible day with depression when youre sick you can get out of bed and take care of yourself when youre in a low sometimes you cant do those things and thats okay youre alive and youre fighting to win so always think more of yourself then the voices in your head say you are not lazy,0
first ask your self the question what is important to you have you always felt like this with your job is this a new thing is some outsides source contributing to your stress new relationship family drama do you like this challenging job? the best thing to do in a stressful situation is vent get it all out of your mind if there someone close to you to talk about this thing i see a therapist so sometimes venting helps i go into that room with a variety of thing on my mind and come out calmer i dont have a solution right away but i am just less stressed exercise helps a lot even if it running for a short distance bipolar or not we all experienced high stress at work just bc you have bipolar does not mean your forced to be in a situation you should not want to be taking days off might give you an idea on how you will feel if you did not have this job i text my self in a stressing situation so i know what was my triggers bc we easily forget what upset is then i go over it with my therapist changes when we have a mental condition can be more difficult to deal with as anxiety goes up depression episode might emerge its ok to be stress dont be hard on your self  i take medication so it keeps me balance sleep on your decisions you might feel differently the next day  we are only human and sometimes we are self are our worst enemies dont look for perfection it does not exist one day at a time  we tend to think of tones of fake senecrious that are more like not to happen  i wish you the best and i sure you will make the right decisions for yours self bc you know your self best,0
its very common to struggle with work im not a great employee it doesnt take much to tap out,0
i feel the same way sometimes i dont think people understand how hard it is having this bipolar disorder trying to function day to day can be a struggle our minds need a break,0
for me quitting means i am letting the bipolar win and im being a slave to my diagnosis my work is what keeps me from being sent to a psych ward work helps to focus me on something other than my illness sure my focus isnt great and my work is sub par in my book im still being productive and keeping up to deadlines otherwise id just be sat at home dwelling on how crap i feel and that leads to a huge pity party for 1 and thats s place i just dont want to be if you need to take a few days off as a break then do it i have the next week off just so i can recharge my batteries i have self care planned getting my nails done having lunch with my sister going for a coffee date with my father and going shopping for a new mattress then the rest of the time i can sleep watch tv catch up on netflix that kinda thing with all that said i say just dont quit,0
you have made yourself a victim instead if accepting you have depression or another mental health issue and dealing with the positives as and web they present themselves thus could mean doing something which makes you totally uncomfortable but doing it for your own self esteem and positive mindset i am still on medication i still shut myself away i still shun parties and get togethers but occasionally i bite the bullet and so far by attending because i have made the decision todo so i have not encountered any major breakdowns inwardly i give myself a pat on the back for achievement,0
ive often thought that having a mental illness separates someone from the rest of the world i feel its as though you live almost alongside people but almost in a bubble or a parallel existence never really gelling or fitting in im trying to find the words to describe how it actually feels as im wondering if that is kinda how you might feel its almost as though the rest of society is bubbling along and the sufferer is almost on the outside looking in trying desperately to belong and be accepted but never achieving this its exhausting and sad at the same time as we feel cut off and lonely as well as different and misunderstood finding people who really understand are few and far between i think only those who are suffering or who have suffered in the past truly understand although of course those others who are really struggling have to put their energies into their own survival unfortunately society as a whole doesnt get it it is a crying shame that the world has little patience or acceptance of mental health problems or disability these two massive groups of people as still not treated as equals with very little compassion by the masses and governments alike however much society tries to show it understands and is trying to support us consideration and understanding comes far too short of the mark people havent got time everyone has their own problems time management issues and lives in essence it is each man for himself so those who may need extra help are left almost forgotten and left to cope essentially on their own many people just dont understand mental illness at all im not saying that they all dont try because some do but in a way you cant blame them mental health problems dont make logical sense to the sufferer quite often let alone those who cant understand how it works my husband once said to my son; if you want to go to the party why cant you go? ie my son desperately wanted to go but his acute anxiety stopped him so sad for him but equally sad for his father who didnt comprehend why sometimes the only true support can be found from like minded people have you found any support groups you could visit? other sufferers usually understand and dont judge in society we are judged there are still stigmas and we can be regarded as different and therefore difficult but infact it is usually the opposite we are far more thoughtful more in touch with how we tick more insightful caring and understanding it is hard though to find the right people quite often sufferers only end up with a very close circle of family and friends ive lost many over the years partly because people probably find me hard work and partly because i push them away and dont make the effort never instigating social engagements but often the people who stick by you through thick and thin are the ones that really matter do you have any support in other ways such as medication or counselling cbt etc? with regards to the feeling of not wanting to be here that totally makes sense often its the feeling of not fitting in being so lonely and just existing rather than living to escape this unbearable and exhausting drudge day after day which is so awful to escape this in the right sense is to get better i think we all crave contentment and peace but the long road to recovery can seem so far away and it can feel such a mountain to climb but it is possible a better life is realistic but it does take a lot of resilience determination and time small but significant steps are necessary but can only done by putting lots of things in place such as a healthy diet sunshine a little exercise support from a range of people and professionals possible medication meaningful activities but to start with just little and often etc etc its almost like a plan but its not easy but the results are both life changing and necessary take one small step at a time make achievable goals which you can then congratulate yourself on be kind to yourself reach out to those who care it is a sign of strength if you can do that we all deserve to find that inner peace best wishes x,0

lack of corauge was and it is the reason i dont do it one day the pain will stop i just dont know how i suffer of anxiety i made a treatment months ago but now im feeling bad again as i have depressive components my head is a ticking bomb im not diagnosed with depression cuz i never went back to the doctor after my anxiety treatment because i was afraid of something i already know being strong but i dont know till when today a boy as killed himself in my hometown he jumped a bridge that made me feel so bad i only imagined it was me,0
this may sound stupid but the thing that has kept me going is comics and superhero stories growing up thats all i had to fall back on to feel better knowing that these people dont budge in the face of adversity was something i admired and wished i could be like not knowing what happens next in these stories because im gone causes me more distress than any problems i have im so grateful for people such as stan lee for bringing these stories to the world and giving me something to cling to until i can hold my own,0
i now understand that just because im feeling suicidal or planning my own demise doesnt mean i want to die suicidal ideation is a symptom of mental illness so just because you are dwelling on it doesnt mean youre going to act on it having said that depressed people do commit suicide so you need to have some strategies to help you through those thoughts seriously - if it were not for my kids i believe i would have opted out long ago they lost their dad to cancer as kids so i use that to remind me what it would do to them if i died by suicide im a christian so i keep reminding myself its not my job to decide how & when i die god has that sorted i have several close women friends i can call on if im feeling really dark two of them have experienced severe depression so get where im at when im this unwell i have an excellent psychiatrist who is only a phone call away if im feeling unsafe she will admit me into hospital until it passes or shes satisfied im safe to return home (i live alone) for some distraction helps i find this only helps if im well enough - have a list of things you can choose from that will distract you from your negative thoughts mindfulness - bring yourself back to now forget the past (too much rubbish) dont think ahead (too scary) light a candle play some [positive] music & just breath different things work better for different people hopefully there are some things amongst all these comments that might help blessings ,0
i have struggled daily for years with suicidal thoughts every morning i wake up and ask myself if today is the day i keep the local crisis lines phone number close at all times i try to change up my routine even the slightest i sleep for days straight i will sit in a public place alone but still surrounded by bystanders and i even just randomly visit friends so i am not alone the worst thing when feeling suicidal is isolation being alone with your thoughts that only lead you in one direction is dangerous dont ever feel afraid to reach out you dont have to be explaining why just do not try and work through it alone be well,0
suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem im 18 and i have attempted to commit suicide ive had thoughts about it since junior high i was hospitalized 5 months ago and i was hospitalized twice so my first time was november 2016and i was hospitalized in tijuana mexico they are not kind to you over there if you are a teen in the tijuana mental health hospital it sucks cuz i spent my 18th birthday at that hospital then i got released november 16 then a month later i was taken back for aggression so i was there for a month from december 12-january 12 so i spent christmas and new years there ill never get that back and i remember the huge stomach pain of anxiety because i thought my life was over and my family was going to abandon me but eventually the psychiatrist let them visit me and hope was brought back i got out after like a week of that visit and then the second time of getting out of the hospital i felt so much more depressed i was very open and honest about the intrusive thoughts of harming others or killing myself cuz i wanted to go away and the hospital would just tell me to control them and that the medication will work eventually it didnt so for the first time ever i began cutting i began to get threatened by my family and others to get the police called on me cuz of my actions and behavior that i couldnt control i was like this for about two or three months after the hospital i told myself i couldnt die no matter how much i had urges to jump off the bridge as i walked to college or jump infront of a car i just couldnt let myself die no matter how much i wanted too so i kept going through treatment it didnt work the medication or therapy so then in san diego my brother and his girlfriend discovered dbt therapy and at the same time when i started my semester in college again i got help from the school psychologist and then i saw like two different psychiatrist and psychologists until they came to the conclusion that they didnt believe i had bpd like how the hospital diagnosed me with that but that i did have severe ocd like they said so this really great psychiatrist did a med change and i immediately had my thoughts of suicide disappear most of them and they didnt make me freak out anymore if they showed up combined with starting dbt two months ago it worked miracles i just finished my first official semester in college and i got all as except one c i had to withdraw my first semester from most classes and get an incomplete for one class so thats why i consider this semester an official one i was really great for 2 months of course not all days will be good but i no longer felt like killing myself up until last week where i was very emotionally overwhelmed by all that had happened to me in my past and i dwelled on it and my mom is a very toxic person on me so i had a crisis and my impulse was to grab a knife and slice my throat i couldnt because i was scared and the knife wasnt sharp enough just big and then so a few days later for the same thing of being emotionally overwhelmed i impulsively cut myself two days but i talked about it in dbt therapy and i used the skills they have taught me and i got very productive i promised myself i was going to practice my guitar every day starting this week and i already learned two songs i write a lot of poetry that help express what i feel and i actually made a page because i want to make it into music and i have many designs to make clothing and i want to be recognized in the future by my writing and clothing and i want to be a voice of inspiration to others who suffer as well so i always keep that in my head that i need to grow and prosper and achieve my dreams and once i get there and if i make a lot of money im gonna fund shit for mental health and keep on trying to be a voice people can relate to or get hope from i want to prove to all the people that bullied me and treated me like shit and caused me trauma that im not just a typical whatever guy i want to be someone big and successful and i know my family isnt completely functional but i cant leave them either i would ruin their lives too so i try to remember all that stuff and even though i dwell on the past a lot and feel so much hatred and anger towards those who hurt me who are a lot of people and all i ever beg for is an apology that ill never get except for one girl i use that as motivation to make sure that im going to prove them wrong one day like muhammad ali "ima show you how great i am!" so even though i did hurt myself this last week my thoughts mostly disappeared i listen to very mellow music that makes me happy i write i play video games i work out and every day i try to achieve a goal no matter how small to feel that i am worth something and closer to growing bigger and closer to the person i dream to be thats how my suicidal thoughts have gone away but i lived hell for years specially 2016 and the beginning of 2017,0
suicide doesnt end the pain it just passes it on to someone else i dont know who said this but its true yesterday was the anniversary of my husbands mothers suicide she committed suicide one year after our marriage i saw what it did to him so even through i am super suicidal dealing with bipolar depression and anxiety i just think of all the pain i have being passed onto my husband and three kids so when it gets so hard to breath and i just want it to end i think of them and i stay,0
ive come to the point where i realize that those thoughts are a just symptom that is part of my condition and like any other symptom i try to address the source i know the source is my brain chemistry and that its hereditary and i accept that its an illness/condition ill have for the duration i let it wash over me with the knowledge that it will pass some days are much harder than others and some day i literally have to give myself permission to lie down and go to sleep i find that sleep usually not always but usually straightens out my thinking knowing what is is though and knowing the patterns and accepting my condition on its terms and mine helps it doesnt make it easy nor am i happy that this is my struggle but it helps,0
suicide ideation can be extremely scary for a person especially as the thoughts can be very vivid and often out with persons control it doesnt neccessarily mean that the person is going to attempt suicide - although not always case and i have in the past but mostly they are a reflection of persons emotional distress ive had times when these thoughts and images have been almost been unbearable i try and distract myself doing something physical to get through unfortunate ly doesnt always work and i have resorted to self harm at times but not as frequent as before,0
my kids and meds i wont lie and it gets easier but with support you can get better now i think of my grandson that i want to be there to meet i realized i cant leave my children in this world alone i have highs and lows but i just tell myself that if im gone my babies will be split up and they will be destroyed because i left them for reasons they couldnt understand if you dont have kids just think about all the things that you want to do despite your "darkness" and how those things will never happen if you go through with it trust me i was sitting in my car on a dark road 2 weeks ago and thinking that i might as well because i was so tired of dealing with the depression and anxiety taking meds seeing doctors but my children and husband kept calling my phone i could hear the hurt in their voices i passed out i dont know how long but when i looked up i saw the lights on my husbands truck and i drove to to a stop sign and he saw me tears in his eyes i knew that i could not do that to my family no matter how i struggle i know that they need me and i need them just as much,0
i use mindfulness techniques sorry for my english i m italian i use "zen"meditation defusions techniques that is trying to separate from thoghts in many ways you can say to yourself" its just a thought i dont have to do anything with it"; repeat the thought in different ways slow very very slow fast very fast with other voices as imitating people until the thought become a "thing" as another insignificant thing you see on a table if you start breathing as u do in meditation or yoga than you can imagine to be on the grass looking to the sky and every thought is a cloud and you put it on a cloud and you see it go away or always breathing imagine to be on a bridge and under you  you see some trains and those trains have their wagons you put your thoughts on the trains like this: train of thoughts on the left train of emotions number 2 train of sensations (about body)number 3and you note what is passing in your mind and you take the thought the emotiin or sensation and put it on the right wagon that is moving under your bridge dont worry if you find on the train that is you believe your thought is so true and strong and you are rapt from it and u follow it without putting an end as you notice this thing you gentle say to yourself :oh i was on the train oroh thank you miss mind or sir thought to rimind me to exist but now i start back breathing mindfully and come back on my bridge and you on your train and i say you goodbye i ts hard and it needs a lot of practice but it works zen meditation helped me a lot but i need to be followed by some people who practice it because alone its hard with a mental illness,0
yes i actually attempted it i put a belt around my neck and just let myself choke i did it in the closet before i knew it i was on a stretcher on my way to the hospital it was like 7am my girlfriend woke up to my cat meowing at the door very loudly when she opened it she said she grabbed my knife and cut me down i was out cold when i got to the hospital after a day or two they put me in the psych ward in there was where i learned how to cope and realized what my triggers were ive had some good things happen since then but i still struggle with it daily stopped taking the meds cuz i just dont believe in them but i just hold on to all the positive thing ive done and keep trying to be more positive i recently made a movie so i do my best to keep my mind busy,0
i look at my children and my husband and everyone that cares about me and think about how not having me in their lives would affect their future sometimes finding strength is hard but you have to push those thoughts aside they too shall pass they are temporary go for a walk or look into medical cannabis surround yourself with something you love please tell someone you are feeling this way call a hotline or tell your doctor there will be better days but please please tell someone if you are overwhelmed by these thoughts good luck to you you are worth it ,0

keep in mind that im typing this without any kind of attitude im not upset or hostile im just talking but that dude is 100% your biggest problem he does absolutely nothing sits on his ass all day long playing video games up until very recently he sat on his ass all day long playing video games and smoking thetic which he will do again mark my words you should not have to clean up after his lazy ass but you do it anyway because you allow him to sit around doing nothing all day in a nutshell youre an enabler im not saying you dont fight him about it but youve never followed through on a single threat youve made where hes concerned why would he wanna change? why would he ever wanna try to be anything more than he is right now? because hes got a meal ticket (you) snuggly tucked away in his back pocket he knows that if he pisses you off all he has to do is spit some sugarcoated bullshit in your ear and youll fall back in his lap he is a grown man amanda and hes no different than your 6 (7?) year old son do you even realize how much better off youd be if his worthless ass just left? how much extra money youd have? what do you even see in him? seriously cuz i could never be attracted let alone be in a relationship with someone like that i honestly believe that if he had his way hed lock himself in somebodys basement and do nothing but eat and play video games for the rest of his life ive never seen a human being who lacked ambition the way he does hes literally a potato i mean the man wears your clothes because hes too lazy to wash his own shirt seriously?! you deserve better!!!!! you shouldnt have raise a grown man and he is not going to change what the hell makes you wanna stay with him? i mean he does nothing he flat out refuses to get a job he steals your freaking bill money for gods sake he doesnt care how he looks he doesnt even have the decency to clean yalls home when youre at work a home he wouldnt even have if it werent for you thats not love amanda hes using you and idk why you cant see that or maybe youre just in denial but either way hes a fucking disgrace and you deserve so so so much better,0
im the same way it feels i push ppl away i tell way to much then its used against me later i have had 2 breakdowns since 2015 i never can get enough sleep i just lay here worrying that im headed right back into an episode i feel so tired all the time i try everything i have in my tool box  i live on very little sleep sometime go for days go for days im prerscibed 5 meds including ambian but never feel rested my mind races i meditate read count in my head drink sleepy time tea i miss appointment bc im exhausted just saw my med dr yesterday he increased my mood stabilizer been in mania hypoagitation since memorial day weekend been having a high and finally getting things done i put off for almost two yrs just waiting for the crash and the lows to come and not be able to do one thing just remember your not alone and that theres no easy cute but i believe it will be manageable in time thanks for sharing hope this helps a little do some self care a mindfullnesstake care,0
exactly i feel a lot of anger im anxious too i didnt do much theses past two years i really let things go around my house w friends and family  but i been going on walks got a gym membership and mowing my own lawn weeding volunteering going to church hanging out w friends and driving again i tend to lash out at times for little things i wait un till im booking over and end up ruining good relationships in the moment of rage im currently in therapy once a week and am joining a traume therapy group next week i was in intensive out patient for fourteen months were i learned dbt skills along w coping skills  i have all the skills to not get so angry but it seems they go out the window along w eating good and sleeping at times i feel very overwhelmed in the mornings i have to drag myself out of bed i never feel rested my brain wont turn off thank you for sharing im very hard on myself and cant seem to stay out of my emotional mind it takes over most the time your advise is very helpful have a nice day thanks again,0
i do a lot of over thinking-induced stressing too and nights are definitely the worst nothing to do but lie there mentally re-living every traumatic experience youve ever had over and over again in your head til youre ready to either cry or physically hurt someone ive never had a major breakdown i dont guess just little ones here and there when i get really angry or too overwhelmed rage has always been my biggest problem but ive simmered down a lot in the last several years learned how to control it ive always found physical actitivities to be the most helpful mowing the yard cleaning just staying busy as long as no other people are around of course lol im not a good "peopler",0
i understand more than you know i had a very similar youth but no meds my parents did not know better ilived in fear most of the time did my best it was not until 2005 when i had my first break down and was hospitalized i had many other things going on too all i can say is this do what you can when feeling good one day at a time give yourself permision to say no to people if not feeling up to it learn what joy is get the book one thousand gifts read it if you can it has helped have faith you can do it i do not know if you believe in god but he has helped me and i had been lost for many years with time inner peace you can and will become whole time is what we have remeber to breath when feeling overwhelmed people who understand will always be there because you are worthy of there love,0
yeah i was diagnosed with everything i have at a very young age so maybe i just wasnt mature enough to receive that particular diagnosis does bipolar disorder often get confused with bpd? theyre pretty similar arent they? i know a lot about bipolar (which i have) and a little bit about bpd but ive never compared the two,1
i havent actually but i have done some research on it and i agree but im reluctant to say that to a doctor lol my moms a nurse and she told me a long time ago that self-diagnosing is the quickest way to get laughed out of a doctors office im not a hypochondriac though and ive been dealing with unmedicated mental illness long enough to tell the difference between whats real and whats not i really think i could have bpd,0
i knew from your first few lines that it would be down to being told you werent good enough when you were younger (been there myself) im glad you found your voice today and spoke to us about how you feel that will empower you and make you feel stronger i found my voice in my late teens and moved away from the toxic people in my life - please find a good counsellor to talk through your self esteem and anxiety issues as they can help you - good luck xx,0
yeah my mom was a nurse and my dad was a very liked very well-known high school football coach and since i was the furthest thing from a stereotypical coachs daughter (a straight-a student member of the student council etc) i was basically the family embarrassment my parents cared a lot about appearances and what other people thought so heaven forbid if i ever opened my mouth mine was rarely a popular opinion for example: a girl was killed in a car accident at my high school jr year she was just one of many students who had died in less than a decade at that school student council (her friends) discussed the possibility of building a memorial for her on the school grounds i was the only person who stood up and said that if they built a memorial for her theyd have to build one for every student who had died at that school that it wasnt fair to commemorate the popular girl and just forget all the others like they didnt matter boy did i hear it when my dad got home that afternoon he storms in the house puts his finger in my face and tells me "her friends can build a memorial for her if they want to and you better damn well keep your mouth shut about it" i never understood that and i dont think i ever will if my daughter stood on her own and risked being hated by everyone she knew doing what she believed is right id burst into flames id be so proud,0
this is so needed for students and parents the reason i say parents also is because my 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with anxiety depression and and she was cutting herself i found this out through the school consular thank heavens for her but one of my daughters friends mothers found out and her daughter is not allowed to be friends with my daughter anymore this hurt my daughter very much i think parents need to be educated about mental illness and realize that it is not contagious,1
as a nami volunteer i got to go speak to 5 different middle school health classes! about mental health how i went from agoraphobic to going to a university- it was a blast we also explained the different illness and where to get help! though i am graduating tomorrow with my ba in business i actually want to enter the fiction arena with the truth of mental health showing positives and some negatives that help us overcome! we are a special people smart creative and hell of a strong group of people we have to be we fight our own brains everyday when i was told i needed a heart transplant this year on my 42nd birthday actually i smiled and said " ok now where do we start so i can get better!" i know depression this caused me to be angry i am back to training for my second degree and my instructor certification the only thing that stops me- is me now i do listen to my body i have more breaks and dont push it all that is through mental health and the struggles i had with it three doctors told me i was stupid! i wish i can find them and invite them to my graduation when i get my ba!! lol,1
my daughter is 11yrs old and im currently sat waiting to go into her school assembly about mental health awareness she was made a mental health ambassador by her school after she was bullied about her dad having issues instead of being upset she decided to turn a negative into a positive and educate the whole school!!! im so so proud right now i could burst!! ❤️,0
they do not want to understand and could careless there is no compassion to the one that is suffering from it panic disorder with agoraphobia had what it seems like forever i been told i fake it to get attention or meds to feel good on so far from the truth,0
i actually found it more distressing than helpful,1
ive been there and struggling again too so i do understand,0
what a great service i hate making phone calls in fact it sends me into a panic so texting is great for me shame this isnt in australia,0
im lucky i live in the uk we have the nhs which we pay for through our taxes we dont have to pay to see doctors or for hospital treatment we do have a charge for prescriptions for people that work the unemployed and very low income earners get them free although we pay a fee it is still cheaper than paying privately our government is planning on privatising our nhs so that will mean well have to get health insurance and things will probably be the same for us as yourselves this really frightens me i bet the insurance for bipolar patients will be sky high i feel for you it must be terrible not to be able to afford the treatment you need i am so lucky at the moment hope you can get the help that you need soon we need our medication it makes life almost bearable good luck ❤️,1
im the same way  it was so bad that i paid some one to stay the day with me if my husband or kid couldnt come over  my husband has been working from home now just so i dont freak out  i feel the safest in the er too been there so many time cause i thought i was having a heart attach or i was going to die i have seen 3 phycologist 2 physiatrist and was told i suffer from a form of ptsd  was put on meds and i use meditation for anxiety to go to sleep too  i found the meditation on u tube really helps and a phycologist that deal with hypnotherapy  when i suffer panic attack even if someone is around me i do gardening or anything to keep my thought busy which is hard when your in an attack you will be told to accept the attacks let them pass  they cant kill you just take a deep breath count to 4  release the air count to 4 slow your breathing down  tell your self that this too shell pass hope that helps a bit  if only there was an easier way to deal with this,0
oh yes i havent left my apartment since tuesday the only time i even get out of bed is to use the bathroom its like every time i move my anxiety sky rockets,1
yes i had an odd fear of leaving my apartment and went a week without doing laundry i had a friend walk me down to the laundry room,0
yes procrastination is a big thing in my little world youll get to them when they dont feel so overwhelming give it a few days,0
im just a little confused diagnosed for 19 years graduating grade 12 were u a newborn when u were diagnosed or did i misunderstand something?,0
i have been properly diagnosed and i choose not to be sick because i had allowed myself to be for so long due to my own fears of self stigma you can call it whatever you want to this is my journey and i chosen to call it that while trying to fight for my health and try to get better after after being robbed so much by my illness i choose not to be sick because my bipolar is no longer in control i am! i choose it every fucking day to make my illness that much easier to fight be it making sure on a bad day i walk my dog to making sure i practice self care our illness and there journeys are each different please do not judge my journey because yours is different for someone who had symptoms 19 fucking years to not have any clearly all my work on my health is paying off i for once in my life have not had repeat thoughts of fucking killing myself because i was tired of feeling sick one day! i could not go to school because my symptoms were always on always making my life a mess when i changed my own mind set to it is now i found what works for me,0
i take gabapentin and valium in high anxiety times i also treat my thyroid go to gymtherapy and well anything that could help,1
hey im so sorry youre going through all that that sounds heart wrenching especially with the added stresses of day to day life with both chronically ill and energetic children! you sound very strong and like you lead with your strength im sure your children admire the fierce example and light you give them and would undoubtedly miss you if you were to go you could visit your oldest and encourage him to have a meaningful life in or out of prison and try to survive together for a while that being said your life is yours and you owe it to no one i hope that in lieu of mess youre taking care of yourself in other ways journaling making time for walks (i always love river walks the water flowing makes me feel like i can move/breathe when im feeling dragged under) the whole "dark times pass" thing is bs but i find that if i tally up small moments of joy or feeling "awake" during the day they help balance darker thoughts to answer your question thoughts all the time i do think theres a difference between suicidal thoughts "i cant do this im not strong enough i want to just die and fade away my loved ones would be happier if i were dead" and suicidal ideation "heres how ill do it ill cancel this appointment to do it that morning sitting about to then walking away then going back writing letters with a time in mind specific" i get more scared of the latter even if thoughts are common,0
no one texts me  with my meds i dream way more at night  i have no one to be awkward around when i isolate who cares who gets pissed off  always wish i could fall asleep normal,0
by the way laugh away! i am very aware of depression and anxiety illness,1
i dont have a lot of money but what i do make sure to do is order my groceries online from shop rite when im having a down week its about $15 extra for them to shop and deliver it but its worth it if otherwise you wont have food i would get cheap stuff like ramen and cup of soup maybe try to get some protein shakes because lack of protein can cause problems with serotonin (i just read something about that the other day) a good goal would be to try to go outside to get your mail every day just so you see the light of day or even just open a window its impossible to think about but those things might help,0
totally agree causes tension in the family strain in every relationship,0
yes the lack of support systems like "family" comes with hand in hand with the illness  ignorance really plus a strong fear of "it couldnt happen to me"  you knuckheads  jaja,0
hooray! and dont worry about age i finished my bsn st 48!,0
this inspires me so so much as a teen suffering with anxiety depression adhd and autism and not being able to get a full education because my mental health has robbed me of it i really see hope for my future after reading this ❤️,1
wow this all sounds disturbingly familar,0
i the only reason i post this kind of stuff is so that people will understand depression betterwhen people hear the word mental illnessthey shy away from youafraid they may catch itit is not contagiousi wont hurt youi wont start talking crazy thingsim just methe same as you,0
ive been running pretty much ever since bipolar first started to get ahold of me when i was 17-18 i go on long runs about 8 miles i built myself up to that over time but it really helps me it helps me with that manic energy it gives me 1-2 hours to also let my mind go and run through the restless thoughts afterwards the endorphins that we naturally produce from a good workout help me feel much better and accomplished running was originally my own form of self harm with the thought of if i collapse and die then thatd be a way out and ran to the point of exhaustion and muscle cramps but over time what was an unhealthy habit of self harm turned into a super positive daily routine of using that time and energy to focus my thoughts and emotions in a productive way to start my days it keeps me in good shape and has been a cornerstone of my mental health and overall well being the last 6 years ive also done things such as rock climbing hot yoga biking anything active that requires you to be in tune with your whole body really really helps me,1
i was so glad to read that you were able to get some help! it is so hard for many of us to reach out and say we need help those who dont have bpd have a hard time understanding how our brain is wired and how our perceptions can get in the way i am so grateful you were able to find a group that you could relate to and then individuals that you could connect with! we need those things in our lives it helps me so much to be able to talk to all of you here! i am struggling right now and feel very much alone,0
i am so glad to hear you were able to connect with a group and then a few individuals! this is so important isolation is not a good thing i am struggling with this myself,0
well i think we all have guilt love u vick,0
not the guilt kim ❤,0
i got bored with one of these within seconds hahaha my brain needs more! i found crochet helps especially when upset as you crochet it all away ❤️,1
i would say the cube would probably work better i have really bad social anxiety and the fidget spinners doesnt appeal to me at all would only bring more attention to myself aswell they seem more of a kids toy to me,1
also i did this last summer with my boyfriends son its called time out bottle i called it a snow globe and did as an art project with him you mix water clear glue and sparkles in a water bottle and mix it up the idea is for them to shake it and watch it the sparkles settle while they sit in time out when its down they are down and calmed down its really actually calming i did one in one of those tinny airplane alcohol bottles to keep in my pocket book for those out in public break downs,1
the peoples who really have an anxiety issue please dont use it  it will make you vacillating so after using this you are unable to focus on anything and feel like a crazy human !! ,1
not everyone its the same i have anxiety and ive used it,1
helps my hubby with anxiety wanting to see how he goes with the cubr,1
i have the cube and i love it helps with my social anxiety,1
my kids have one and they love itive tried it didnt work for me i would like to try the cube its completly different for me my anxiety spikes when i use a spinner ,1
same here i actually get very restless i guess it doesnt work for everyone,1
it helps me with anxiety,1
i saw where people are upset because the bushings may fall out when you put it in your mouth,0
ignorant people can sometimes be willfully ignorant please dont turn your back on your faith due to these peoples sin of unkindness find a church where you will be loved for who you are flaws and all my depression and anxiety make it very difficult for me to walk a joyful triumphant christian life someday youll find a church like my family did where a woman who publicly shared about her suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalization is now in a lay leadership role,0
i am a christian and yes i would be hurt offended and very upset by someone saying that to me run dont walk out of there! it does not mean you have to give up your faith just that that particular church is not for you i am so very sorry you had this happen to you and there is also no way to cleanse the mental illness out of your dna those people sound very uneducated and judgemental ,0
this is a poisonous and dangerous point of view and it does nothing but shame somebody who is bipolar well shame on anybody who has said that to you shame on them,0
holy crap marc im shaking,0
we really do struggle,0
i do everyday its a struggle,0
amen i am one that struggles and battles that world i know though i have seen people suffer tremendously worse than myself ,0
im an apostolic pentecostal and i recently went back to church unfortunately i listened to several churches that brought me to the altar three times trying to throw the "demons" out of me while my three small children watched fearfully i am not possessed its not the devil i am a returning christian and i will also tell you that i found my church by interviewing pastors first i found a great one who understands and does not do that you may have to seek out a different church pray about it and i will be praying with you in jesus name!,1
it is totally disturbing,0
the devil has nothing to do with your biology and psychology this is the kind of abusive rhetoric that made people fear epileptic people and condemn them instead of helping stay away from that church they are not rational,0
thats horrible and rude of her,0
im not a member of this group but saw this post as a friend of mine is as a christian minister i would be embarrassed to hear any fellow church leader refer to any mental illness in such a way as a church we are not perfect but we try to support someone with any type of mental illness in the same way we would someone with a physical illness im actually attending a seminar next week on pastoral care for people with mental illness as being equipped to help people who are suffering is a key part of what we are about im sorry you were treated in such a way,0
it is why i belong to no organized religion when the church told my father i was a whore for allowing my uncle to get his kicks out of bouncing me on his lap (i was maybe 3??) and surely more so when i asked why was there blood in my underwear after a visit with my cousins! age 6 or 7?? so no people who believe this kind of vudoo thinking are only clinging to irrational and harmful beliefs in my opinion it holds back our humanity,0
i am a christian i attended a pentecostal church for about 6 months the preachers wife who did most of the preaching on wednesday nights for whatever reason said during a sermon pretty much that adhd and bipolar didnt exist her nephew had been "acting up" and was diagnosed with adhd so i caught her after the sermon and asked her how she can say something like that when there are scientific brain scans that can be done to show the physical difference between someone with a normal brain as opposed to someone with bipolar i mean i get her not believing her nephew had adhd because he was only 6 or so but to blatantly say bipolar didnt exist rubbed me the wrong way her response was they have has several people in the congregation that were bipolar and that through prayer they were healed i looked at her and said well then they never had it to begin with and walked out i never went back i know have been attending a different church for over a year and the pastor knows im bipolar and he knows that there is science involved in order to keep me stabilized because my pastor is a rational thinking man he doesnt try to convince anyone with any disabilities that simply praying will make it go away he prays for and with us when we struggle but he understands it wont just go away,0
dont trust people in the "church" that is only a building an institution trust in the word i had the same dilemma but here it is psalm 118:8 "it is better to take refuge in the lord than to trust in man" the church is just a institution but the real church are believers in jesus i know some people might not believe some here are atheists etc others might ask why the lord would curse them with a sickness i myself has struggled with this i suffer from bi-polar too and have done some crazy things during mania i dont believe in the church as an institution at all i do believe in jesus the only way human sickness is because the flesh is fleeting it is manifestation of our sin it is flawed and degrading due to our sin since the exile from eden we are no longer in his image there is no cure for our ailment yet but keep faith it has helped me in some dark times,0
i am attacked by bipolarity ptsd and others psychology does not believe in demons possession but after 18 years of therapy and medication i finally tried exorcism i feel the best i ever have! i am still on three medications but i am down from six! some mental illness is a chemical imbalance and others are clinical as you know i believe now that clinical mental illness is really demon possession and should be treated as such look at the man yelling while walking down the street he is not just ramblings there is a subject and a verb someone did something or didnt (god maby)and he relives this over and over he cant get past it mary the government husband etc etc these people are hurting and you dont just tell hurting people to "get over it" they are believing lies and need to hear the truth! maby there should be some kind of combination treatment combining faith reason and a little medication until maximum improvement is achieved i was on lithium for 15 years and all it did was make me numb to life! i could feel anger love fear or joy! is that healing? no,0
i think i agree with you carol mental illness requires a holistic approach you need encouragement in terms of biblical upliftment medication and therapy i believe its vital to anchor oneself especially as mental illnesses bring about anxiety self-doubt etc etc also lots of self-love positivity and a cherished support system are necessary,1
there are some that feel prayer will cure cancer that scares me a little i liken it to "you wouldnt tell a diabetic not to take their meds but you shun mental illness?",1
i probably should ignore them but i dont  i flat out tell them they are wrong and that way of thinking is damaging  and if they dont believe in doctors they should keep it to themselves  i always associate it to blood pressure pills and cancer treatments and tell them to go to those people as well with their "praying it out ",0
thats horrible im sorry you went through that,0
yes i have been told this before sadly by some of my own family they kinda get it now there is also an unspoken thing that other christians believe it is because of a lack of faith in god i have learned to try and avoid those people god has brought me some people who understand or at least try to understand i pray that god will send you someone like that as far as church right now idk i havent gone in a while im not exactly sure why partly sick of the masquerade pray about finding another church that will welcome you with open arms if that is what you feel led to do,0
15 years ago i leave church protestant coz call me anormal the younger brother and sister and make me cry always and i say i come from protestant baptist and i m not new protestant coz i raised n serve to god in my old other church before and they say how u know bible i say i study missionary and be leader before in my other church but more be unkind to me this latin protestant church i got upset n decided to leave church and protestant n still my life outside but i still belief in god coz i start not go this chruch any say hello and all my life start hard and mistake and get a very traumatic and bad experience i end with mental illnes and eating disorder but i dont think i can go to church where i can be open and help me where is the love of god the preacher ? when i try to be open in the other pastor about my trauma say forget and forgive to who hurt u when u was kid and u sin will be forgive and maybe u play quija or have a satanic familiar and i say no i dont have that i m good person and i was just a little 5 years old little kid be victim of something traumatic happening to me nothing to help nothing nice answer and nothing to heal say go to say sorry and forgive the person who hurt u and u can be better and pray more and u need more commited to god ,0
im catholic and i never heard such nonsense yeah you can pray for strength to fight your struggles but not to "cure" yourself or "get over it" wtfpeople should be helping you grow in faith and support you thru hard times instead of demonizing youfind a new church!!,0
narcissism is a personality disorder the cause is unknown but believed to be influenced by parenting of a child with biological vulnerabilities is it not chemical,1
my phone is on 24/7 if anyone needs someone to talk to dont hesitate to throw me a msssage ,0
try and remember that depression doesnt last forever it will lift eventually lift and you will have some peace it is a brutal disease and i too have struggled with suicidal thoughts and i know how bad they hurt stay strong never let bipolar win,0
ive been feeling like this on n off for years but the last few months its gotten worse and im struggling to cope with all my thoughts worries and emotions x,0
i have a few things that trigger this reaction i try to avoid them when i can,0
i know how you feel i also have a daughter that suffers bpd and it so painful to see her struggle ~s~,0
this is me most days its usually something stupid: your work colleague giving you a look your manager criticising your work then the black cloud appears its hard to shake off the obsession with turning the words over in your headits painful you just feel fragile,0
i hear ya!!! keep this in mind for anxiety/panic attacks to help ground you back in reality,1
some stuff id say is anxiety some id say is laziness lol,0
this means so much to me thank u for getting this i suffer from depression and anxiety and ptsd and i am also bipolar,1
as frustrating as it is healing takes time as you have pointed out yourself if you go too fast you risk making the recovery process longer or even permanent damage to your knee just take things day by day,0
love my latuda i take a higher dose so i do take it around bedtime but had to go off of it do to running out and noticed a big difference inderal helps my anxiety i take 10 mg 3x a day but am more able to do normal things without panic attacks like run to the grocery store latuda did make me gain weight but thats the only side effect i remember i think its a great combo,1
weight gain on latuda i only took it for 6 weeks while in the hospital  i was extremely tired but was also on depicote and clonazepam saw my doctor after i was released and he put me on back on my old meds zoloft clonazepam doxipen remeron and lamictal im been tipping and a bit manic due to be back in the real world and daily stress but i have coping skills a tool box phone coaching therapy and a great network of support,1
i dont have answer because i do the exact same thing and then you just feel worthless and horrible i understand and struggle hope you start to feel better,0
are u confused? or are u just stupid? do u know who ur talking to? idk about the other people commenting on this page but this isnt about big pharma the meds we take keep us from killing ourselves hurting ourselves hurting others keeping certain chemicals in our brain on track gtfo,1
this is where i am right now my marriage will be over in 6 days his anger and spitefulness are overwhelming (no i did not cheat or lie) he calls me just to twist the knife in a little harder to gloat i will never be the same i dont think i will ever trust to be in a relationship again this was 9 years married just under 3 years,0
i told my best friend this via text that i could t handle calls so please text or message me she then would text and as soon as i relied shed call needless to say we do t talk to each other anymore she couldnt respect me and my decision to not take calls due to anxiety and she couldnt understand why i wouldnt take her calls except to be rude sad,0
im the other way i struggle via text im very blunt and to the point and that really doesnt come ovet in text theres no feeling,0
people hear what they want hear some times when you are so stressed out you cant cope with everything that is around you it to much people don understand what you go though you try to say what your going through it best to say nothing let say what they want say you understand what go on with you and just adored them they slang off some one else people should judge you they should judg themselves and leave you alone xxx,0
1 avoid alcohol 2 take your meds 3 rinse and repeat,1
this is what my friend once said he is first one to tell me about adhd talking about my anxiety nature - while taken as a gift it feels better i also like that metaphor canary on the coal mine in any case there is uplifting purpose why i am this way <3 worth keeping going,0
please please dont give up dont let this awful illness beat you so many questions which you dont have answers for we need logic in our lives to make any sense of the world and ourselves but mental illness doesnt often make logical sense eg we can often feel alone but push people away etc i guess i would need to ask lots of questions to help you answer some of yours but i think our minds are such a complex organ and just like others in our bodies it sometimes doesnt work as we want it to and sometimes it cant cope at certain times in our lives some people need help im not sure whether you are receiving or have had any support from family or professionals or have help in the form of medication therapy etc i remember at my lowest points i felt my head was constantly on fire its exhausting (no wonder you feel always tired) and escape from our thoughts can feel so welcome impossible and/or necessary you say you ve struggled for four years thats one of the worst things that it can go on for so long and feel as though it can take forever to get better i felt it wasnt living only existing not a life why? a 64 million dollar question the answer; probably due to hundreds of small things and quite possibly made worse by some notable bigger things im sure study could have been really hard the discipline and energy needed may well have taken its toll but once it was over your life changed possibly exciting in one way but scary in another as your secured your job i dont like to second guess as i dont know but just trying to look at possible triggers and difficulties beginning a new stage of life must have been challenging why anyone has anxiety or depression at any point in their life if only we knew but the important thing is how to get better from here plans are great goals are good but they can also seem insurmountable too big on good days we might feel we can conquer the world and make wonderful plans on bad days getting out of bed is a step too far plans i think are definitely a good idea but they also need to include smaller achievable but significant goals do your friends understand? are they supportive? yes always anxious sounds familiar when we struggle it can be one long round of constant anxiety as you arent well it makes sense if you arent at peace with yourself or content i believe we all ultimately want to get better to escape the quagmire of self pity and crap we are in but its to find that way forward one step at a time dont lose sight of those plans but also it is necessary to be realistic and accept that it isnt going to be easy hold onto the hope that it can get better lean on those you love tell them how you feel and let them help you life can get better take good care be kind to yourself you deserve a better life x,0
dont give upget a good psychologist and learn to manage the mood swings; before being diagnosed (and getting help) i went thru a period of months realizing i didnt have to say more than 12 words a day only to find i could cut it down to six! been depressed for days now but will struggle ondont give up!,0
i had to spiritually see the fact that god loves us so much that we are never going to die  and fall to my knees in shame being completely embraced by mercy in order to not want to kill myself and that experience actually happened on the morning of the day i was planning on ending this life forget the space/time continuum we exist in the love/forgiveness continuum,0
everyday is a struggle try to keep your mind occupied hobbies or a job with lots of ot thats how i get by,0
hey im so sorry to read youre not feeling well my first thought was: are you or have you in the past 4 yrs received any treatment or medication for your anxiety & im guessing depression? have you spoken to anyone including a dr about how youre feeling right now? if not can you do that before you resort to self harm? i know its hard ive lived with a variety of mood disorders since my early teens so appreciate how youre feeling i encourage you to take the first step & find someone you trust that you can share your struggle with blessings ,0
shakir,0
yes amen my be hurting so bad i just want to die i just learn last year that i have anxiety and depression,1
so true it sucks and its miserable my mind works against me its hopeless,1
my son just dx wit bipolar wit psychosis n he is the same way now he is getting a little better more involved wit us as his family i have read n keep reading about how to make him feel part of everything we do lots of vitaminsminerals no tension in our home no negative arguments all positive lots of love hugs n reassurance that all is going to be ok as a family we may not know how to deal wit new things tat happen to our loved ones but the best way is to educate ourselves find therapy counseling a dr tat will take u under his wing n do wats best for u always try hard to be positive n when things get difficult go outside look up to the sky day or night n pray have faith n believe tat god has a plan for u n no matter wat is happening he already knows ur going to be stronger then ever,0
for me bipolar makes it hard to leave things in the past and get rid of baggage lets be honest- maybe i dont want to but im learning everyday even though ive been dealing with this for 20yrs now it never stops being hard but it does get less hard dont worry about what you missed worry about how its enriching your life to be able to put the pieces together hope this helps,0
yeah i feel that way  confusing and then disappoint and then depressionmanialol i only laugh cause what else can i do everyday i try to be normal functioning,1
i think for me when i finally got my dx it took longer because i was flighty i would quit before they could tell me whats wrong because i didnt want to hear it and well mental illness doesnt exactly make consistency easy but i stuck with it a few years ago i had gotten out of a horrible abusive marriage i had 2 boys counting on me and i just knew i didnt want to be me anymore whatever that was or had been its taken a long time to get to where i am and im still a long way to where i need to go but i am further than ive ever been i dont regret waiting because everything happens for a reason and for whatever reason i wasnt ready and living in what-if will drive me mad(der) if i knew i was "so screwed up in the head" i would have never had kids i would have never lived any of the experiences i have the thought of not having my boys is beyond comprehension they are my salvation at times they are the one thing ive gotten right in life they are what gave me the strength to get out of an abusive marriage without them i wouldnt be here so an earlier dx would have prevented them from being born,0
in 2014 a dr prescribed those to me and although i already shake bc of my anxiety those made my shaking worse it was embarrassing i saw a psychiatrist a few months later and he told me that the dr shouldnt have precribed me those two together he put me on effexor klonopin and trazadone and my shaking almost stopped good luck hope you can find something better,1
wellbrutin made me shake im on zoloft clonazepam doxipen remeron lamictal and ambian as needed for insomnia took me 2 years to get right im getting mine upped since im tipping a little up the lamictal is at the lowest dose need more ,0
i used to take wellbutrin and would shake,1
dont b ashamed of ur illness,0
tell these ppl they have no clue what they are saying or talking about! and that bipolar is a far more serious issue then even jus an array of emotions at one time did u know that bipolar also causes serious physical health problems?! ask them if they know that!?! tell them they need to be more educated on sumthin b4 they go shooting off at the mouth! and u dont need to tell them its u that suffers tell them u know many close ppl that do not that u should be ashamed at all!!! thats like being ashamed that u have a limp or other defect from birth u cannot help how u were born i wear my bipolar proudly! i am exactly how god made me!,0
i think this is a great question! i always call people out on that but i do it discreetly so they dont feel embarrassed plus they usually listen if they dont feel threatened i say something like "i know you mean no harm by that but please take a moment to consider your listeners- maybe they have a loved one with bp and using mental illness as a joke only perpetuates their feelings of isolation" be kind to them and respectful and youd be surprised how many positive responses youll get good luck!,0
i know it upsets me so much its very irritating but i have to calm myself down and educate them not that they ever care because they will tell me it was a joke then i educate them some more it hurts yes but there is still a lot of stigma on mental illness it will take a while to change the world but you can educate one person at a time,0
my daughter and i are bipolar we make statements like this often to each other only when we are in private amongst each other it is our way of trying to find humor in such a horrible illness gives us a reason to laugh and understand at the same time we suffer sever depression with ours and the moods swings so when we can laugh its great,0
dont be ashamed youve done nothing wrong nothing to be ashamed about we just are who we are as for them? theres no educating the ignorant just keep stepping do you ;,0
hiim not bipolar i have suffered from anxiety depression and ptsd  soooo im with you would these same people use the word "retarded"?!?maybe ask themwe know its not correct to say that some people need to be alerted to others feelings ,0
dont feel shame that only allows the illness to win if it bugs you say something!,0
i am going through this right now i have trust issues and the guy im with now ive known for 16yrs this is our 3rd time trying in a relationship we love each other imensly we have each others backs but its my insecurities that push him away everytime i try so hard not to question him about stuff but if i dont it eats me up inside and drives me crazy hes trying to deal with it but i see its going to push him away i cant stop what do i do can anyone help me please,0
its out there you will find the one it just takes the right person i was married for almost 9 years i loved her in the beginning but i had suspensions that shut my feelings off the hardest thing i ever did was not fallow my manic urges till the end i always thought she was cheating turns out she was sent me in to a uncontrollable manic state real quick then a deep depression im still stuck in now we been separated almost 2 years and divorced just over a year now she still my friend but i have to be careful because she now how to use me against me the good news is some how in the last year i have stumbled across a wonderful women that has the patience of a saint and a heart of gold she has not push anything and lets me do me she has helped me heal and grow i know realise i am going to be ok with proper support we decide to start merging our families in to one big family and moved in together she has showed me its ok to love again i call her my sunshine because she is the only person that can brighten my day with just a smile im scared to admit it to her but i have fallen in love a love that i have never felt before a love that scares the holy hell out of me she always tells me "its ok al we dont need to rush i love you and i am here and will always be here your mine and i aint letting you go again",0
yep and i truly dont care right now ill be 42 in a few weeks never married no kids but ive decided to only focus on me and having a baby myself (thru an iui with an a anonymous sperm donor) im not giving up on becoming a mom due to not being able to find a "good man" i feel that my bipolar is not to blame the only way in which i can remotely see its role is that i am very "all or nothing" and also i trust nobody and will go to great lengths to make sure my man isnt lying or cheating on me so i can become obsessed with that and am an amazing natural at playing detective i have had tons of past serious relationships but sure enough my instincts were always right on and id catch them in huge lies all the time (and some cheating!!),0
i feel the same way i just started seeing someone n really fkin afraid that my anxiety n depression would scare her away :(,1
i feel the same way i have a big paranoia that past relationships were better than having me and easier and happier than being with me i feel too crazy i feel mean at times when i snap but cant change it and i always think theres someone else it sucks and the hard thing is trying to figure out if its our head thinking up crap again or if it really is how youre thinking it is however in saying all that im a strong believer that theres someone for everyone to love,0
yes 100% this thought is a major player in my depression id love to be in a relationship have kids etc the whole deal i am 34 and cant shake the feeling its never going to happen now even though i want it to more than anything in the world it sucks :(,0
theres hope i have bipolar borderline personality and anxiety as well as thyroid disease and hypoglycemia and ive been in a relationship 16 years now never split up believe me im a roller coaster to live with and hes a saint for dealing with it but we stay together and weve both only kissed another person once and we talked it over and neither of us have been unfaithful since,0
same i always feel staff dont like me paranoid but i cant help it i am going for my second attempt at cbt ❤️️,0
i have been in a relationship for 6 years with my bp boyfriend and i can tell you it hasnt been an easy road!! honesty trust and most of all communication is essential as well as an understanding of his illness through reading posts like these he has his own room therefore his own space for whenever he needs it and i respect his need for it im slowly developing a thick skin for his hurtful words and actions when hes manic because i see the great person he truly is beneath his fears phobias and anxiety and try to reassure him and help keep him grounded so far so good dont give up on love the right one is out there waiting for you xxxx,0
ive been married for 2 and a half years and we have been together a total of 6years and known each other 8 years my mother and aunt whom both have varying severities of bp and anxiety plus eating disorders have been married over 24 years just need to find the one whom can deal with / help you through the crazy,1
im glad i had the opportunity to have been in a 20 year marriage i just wish hed been strong enough to have stood by me to find out what was wrong with me ((i was diagnosed during the divorce but symptoms were there for many years) now i am afraid no-one will want to deal with my issues not that anyone is even looking to get to know me without knowing about them so i figure ill grow old and die alone,0
ive been with my boyfriend for almost a year before this relationship i didnt think i would ever be in one - i didnt even want to be in one from the very beginning of our relationship we were both 100% honest with each other he knew about all my struggles and i made sure he understood that our relationship will not be easy it takes a lot of communication especially right now because we are long distance i think communication and honesty from the get go is key,0
yes the saddest part is that while things were good i fell in love with my now husband im not doing well anymore and the poor guy is stuck with me i cant stand to be around me and he tries really hard to understand my mood swings and need to be left alone but unless youve been were we go mentally you cant understand i feel so bad for him! he never would cheat doesnt mean i dont worry that he should find someone that could gives him what i cant he deserve to be happy you know? and i cant be that !,0
same here jessie and everthing in my life i lost because my fear only my job,0
yep!!! been with my man for 2 years and just today i think my fears have been somewhat settled my biggest fear was never being loved because of my brain hes saw some dark things inside of me,0
number 1 without a doubt! 8 hours sleep ive not slept for 48hours now im shattered but my mind wont switch off ,1
1 without a doubt ,0
2 without a doubt ,0
definitely number 2 always feel overwhelmed when it comes to cleaning the house be nice if the house could just tidy up after itself :),0
2 no hesitation,0
2! no questions about it cleaning is one thing that gets my anxiety acting up real fast! and arguing with my kids to get them to help clean only makes it worse! so definitely 2!,1
definitely 2 a dirty house irritates me but most of the time i dont have the energy,0
2 get overwhelmed  to much house to keep clean,0
1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1! anyone else desperate for sleep???,1
without hesitation 2,0
2 no doubts,0
2! some days im great and my ocd kicks in and others im going crazy cuz my ocd kicks in but my bpd episode of the day wont let do anything anxiety on top of depression,0
i truly know how you feel i was recently diagnosed with bpd i also have ocd depression and anxiety how do you handle everything? i feel like im drowning half the time,0
1 without question or hesitation anxiety and chronic nerve joint and back pain keeps me from getting decent sleep most of the time,1
one and four on high anxiety days,1
i think i would struggle with two,0
a definitely a cleaning is a chore but i have certain days i do certain tasks which helps keep it from overwhelming me and my kid is 16 she can feed herself and im way to particular to let anyone else run my errands (i wont even let people fold my towels lol),0
2 i struggle bad during the lows to keep my house maintained would be so much easier to not have to worry about it,0
all the time too scared to let anyone know what is really going on in my head too scared to let anyone in because i dont know how they will react or how they will treat me after reading what is going on in my head,0
if you cant do some exercise but have you tube go on there and find jason stephenson guided meditation to anxiety go and lie down close your eyes and take some deep breaths in through your nose for say the count of four and breath out through your mouth for the count of six letting go of all that anxiety good luck phone your doctor if you need to,1

shy valdez,0
in my ultrahypersensitvity i go through post traumatic stress hourly,0
hi i suffer from chronic anxiety disorder and agoraphobia i saw your post and just wondered how u live everyday life each day is a struggle for me and im determined to fight this but unfortunately it doesnt leave despite meds etc,0
ive had severe depression severe anxiety and ptsd for the majority of my life i gave birth to my beautiful baby boy last friday and now im pretty sure i can add post partum depression in there ive been on meds but i feel like they arent working anymore i have a doctors appointment next week for it but for now i just feel like im spiraling my husband is trying to help but i just cant stop crying i love my son and im loving having him i dont regret him i dont wish him any harm i just am in a really dark place in my head right now,0
thomas riske,0
ive got epilepsy and anxiety but some people only understand the epilepsy and not both together and the damage it can cause,0
i have been rejected by so many people at so many times that i profoundly believe that i am unlovable i am terrified of the future because of my past everyday is a new day but when most of the past days have been shit its very difficult to accept that the coming days will be better i havent given up yet and still struggling everyday hoping against the hope that some miracle will change the world,0
many times in my life i was a " go getter " i went to college early away from home adjusted and adapted and joined the friends and crowds  ive been engaged to 3 different decent men and i have never had any children  i became a nurse at 21 and ive been married  help raise my ex husbands kids who grew up wonderful i divorced my husband after five years and moved back into my parents home  in 13 years of nursing ive worked at four places and agency and i try to stay at the same place as long as i can  im comfortable where i am working and who i am today at 35 im not afraid of failure anymore; atleast not as much as i used to be and daily i do my best to stay on the right track and achieve however contrary to popular belief i like to be alone and not visit unless im very comfortable around someone and thats the problem perhaps  i lay the cards out right away because i figure people will know me truly that way  ive always been " ok bla bla this is me abt questions " i cannot explain my anxieties but when im in work mode its fight or flight and im a leader to the best of my ability my largest fear is making a mistake and we all make mistakes  my largest fear is staying alone even tho i needed that time to heal  ty,0
im sometimes afraid of living and that terrifies me i have cried immediately after waking up simply because i was still alive i actually have people who love me a wife etc and none of it is good enough to change my illness,0
this is not unique to any kind of mental illness and the suggestion that it is could be quite damaging to anyone reading it this is a great page by and large but i do wonder if some members ability to sort the wheat from the chaff is somewhat lacking at times fear of the unknown is perfectly normal but obsessing over things which might not come to pass might not be,0
you look and you search for as long as it takes however horrible the journey and whatever you lose along the way it is imperative to your life that you undertake this mission killing yourself does not transcend pain in any way it means causing only more of it take a step towards people and they will take two towards you those who dont were never worth your time or your heart in the first place and they will be the most surprising people in your life after total honesty and disclosure only then do you know what your really have to work with in your life to carry on with,0
by submitting themselves to the biggest unknown to humankind? i tried to kill myself last year but i lived because i can still feed my baby daughter breakfast every morning i am very glad that i did not die of course in desperation our reason and logic and our vision can all abandon us but believe me and take this from a person who knows it can get better and you can take control you have to find your strength which means you look in the first place you last had it inside of yourself,1
my personal belief is that due to the fear of the unknown  people take their own lives to feel in control,0
im afraid of dying the fear of the unknown when ill die or what happens when i do keeps me up at night often,0
i have bipolar 2 and i didnt feel a big change until i started taking lithium i still take about 6 or 7 different medicines in addition to that and they all work together to give me the best results possible i did get lithium poisoning once which was horrible but the doctor just lowered my dosage and i was fine i go for blood tests every few months to check lithium levels i really started feeling like a person once i started the lithium,1
night terrors can be brought on by certain medications i get them sometimes and need to take a diazapam with my sleeping pill/mood stabilizer,1
hi liz i so hear you about being tired of going back and forth to the doc and playing the trail and error game as hard as it may be to play that game unfortunately its about the only way they can find the right combination for you and your body type each one of us is different in how our bodies will react so its hard to say what will work for you it can take a long time to find the right combination but its not just about the meds please as anne stated work at finding a team that can help you this includes a psychiatrist your family doc and a therapist and other supports as well you talk about the nightmares and night tremors this is something that you can work with a trained prefessional on with cbt or other forms of therapy that work for you (again sometimes trail and error but worth it) in my opinion and experience it was only when i had a therapist that i trusted and could really open up to and be able to talk about the reasons for my ptsd that i was able to slowly get the nightmares terrors and body memories to get less frequent hang in there and continue to work with your team to find the best treatment for you,1
hi guillermo i have bpd and bipolar 2 with anxiety and ptsd i was fortunate in finding a therapist on the referal of a thrapist i knew socially but i think a google seach may be in order for you google bpd and it may bring up a sub search of therapists in your area,0
wow do i understand this i know what its like to be bipolar with manic depression and anger issues that was wrong for him to push you to get to that point after two years he should know that stop means stop not just for your health but because its not good on either one of you for you to get that upset i know when im angry i dont always think through what im saying and have been known to say things that hurt not meaning too im just going to throw this out there if you ever need anyone to talk to message me i will gladly be the ear that you need with nobody else will,0
how i feel most days and its like a daily struggle to just get up and get going but i cant seem to get anyone to understand,0
my sweet baby girl missed almost a year at 15 and now we homeschool so all the pressure is lifted,1
in the last "42" years i have had two therapist that i felt close to connected with and trusted they save me more than once from self harm or worse it helped to be able to talk to them i no longer have them and i can definitely relate to being disconnected and feeling isolated it is a horrible feeling that no one would ever understand unless they have experienced it i now realize after all of these years that i will just have to except that i am alone in this respect and continue to be thankful for the blessings i do have,0
confused,0
for about a month now my anxiety has been through the roof and i am so stuck in between these two i know ill have to work extra hard to get out of this anxiety because i want to live more than anything i have so much to live for this may be hard but the fight is worth it!,0
just afraid to live,0
im not afraid to die in fact i wish for it every day,0
im not afraid to die im afraid of leaving my 4 babies behind,0
horrible existence isnt it i been there for decades,0
thats me not that im anti social im polite and friendly to everyone just shy and anxious so i withdraw and people think im different,0
nah its just anxiety,0
or people cause anxiety and a low self-esteem even my closest friends dont invite me over,0
sorry its so long but hope it helps meds are a struggle,1
first stop being ashamed would you feel shame if you had cancer? when people say something like that just know they are saying the weather is having mood swings wet dry cold hotits not actually directed or meant as anything i have lived with this for 45 years and ive learned it is part of who i am and i feel no shame but not from lack of trying to shame me from my mom its just who i am and i have enough triggers without letting ignorance of someone else be another next time someone says something is "bipolar" respond with poor weather poor wash machine you have no idea what they are going through and laugh it off dont be ashamed of the illness it makes us very special we are talented artistic and all around extremely intelligent people thats nothing to be ashamed of,0
thank u to everyone who has responded my mothers advice was "to take the high road" and not let it affect my day easier said than done i would love to educate those who use the term so lightly but speaking up is something i have never been good at i have only opened up to a few people about being diagnosed with bipolar2 and bpd i have alienated every friend i have ever made because i could not handle "the pressure" of friendship so now i have made a friend and she uses the term bipolar for anything from her hair to the weather i try to laugh it off as ignorance but deep down it makes me feel imperfect and different from "regular people" i take mood stabilizer s and use cannabis for anxiety but still have those underlying symptoms to struggle with i have family that loves me but they will never understand the battle i am fighting with myself i guess i will have to learn how to love myself before i try to make friends and learn to let the little things go i am thankful that i am not the only one feeling this way but its a rotten feeling to feel ashamed to be me keep on keeping on much love from colorado,0
we have borrowed the term from the english language to fit the disorder not the other way around i am an electrician and polar and bipolar are generic terms we use when i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder i understood it very clearly because i connected it with the electrical term i wouldnt get upset because when people are saying it they most likely are not comparing it in their head with bipolar disorder one or 2 they most likely have a different picture in their head altogether then you are imagining i hope this helps,1
the thing that gets me upset is that the ones who say it are usually the ones that put up the mental illness support memes on their facebook page,0

i have been diagnosed with bp2 ptsd and anxiety i currently take 1500 depokate in the morning & 400 serquoel in the evening ive never been more content dont get me wrong not everyday is a cake walk i use to be on lamictal and it worked wonders with that being said research the drug closely after long periods of time it can possibly cause gastrointestinal issues i then had to be taken off all my meds one by one slowly all while losing weight from being sick,1
bipolar ii gsad and hypomania depakote 250 mg/d and paxil (15-25 mg/d depending on what is going on in my life) i need the depakote to flatten out the cycling and the paxil to keep the anxiety under control it seems if i can keep the anxiety under control then the depakote can hold me steady if i let the fear take hold then i start back up the hypomanic train the trick for me is balacing paxil dose with stress,1
when i was on lamictal i took it with cymbolta lithium is ok right now im on respidone for bpd with buspirone for anxiety,1
i have bipolar one borderline personality disorder temporal lobe epilepsy adhd ptsd and ocd at the moment the docs are only treating my epilepsy as i have had a spike of bad seizures that we cant get under control so they have stopped my bipolar meds im coping okay just not sleeping so im really touchy and grumpy im struggling with routine as i am studying and cant seem to get my head in the game when it comes to sitting down and hitting the books but i will keep trying and always keep fighting i hope things come right for you just have faith faith that you will overcome because life says that you should never be ashamed of your scars because they show that you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you be strong,0
i will have a look into that im sleeping an average of 3 hours a night and im so scared im going to go manic on another note have you tried dbt? it really helps with the bipolar it did wonders for me,0
liz stjepanović i was on lamictal and i noticed the same thing  my mania was more frequent and my depressive was so bad i had myself committed  i agree i think maybe a change in meds will help but i am in the same boat as i am struggling as well  what i hate about this illness is you can be feeling wonderful one day and then the next your world comes crashing and its exhausting high five back to you for battling this horrible illness!!,0
hi suffer bipolar 2 and take fluoxetine which is another name for zoloft this is only for anxiety i was on lamotrogen but never worked for me that was given for my dissociation i tried a lot of other drugs like risperidonequitiapine arripiprazole i am now taking lithium which works for me these are the meds for bipolar so maybe you need to ask to try one of these see how you feel but to me this is why your still struggling because your not taking the right meds hope this helps xx,1
but keep in mind even though lithium works great there will come a day it stops working out of the blue for no reason been there done that i myself am manic bipolar anxiety attacks panic attacks phrenia border personality disorder ptsd ect i have 3 pages front and back full of medicine that didnt work after lithium stopped working after a year today i take 150mg antitripline and 30 mg prosac and it works like a charm i couldnt take valium xanex or kolinipin cuz after 10 yrs i developed a adverse reaction and kept ending up in jail and not able to remember why also check into seraqual it will put u to sleep i promise,1
oh yes i heard that also something about lithium levels needing to be tested regularly because if theyre too high they can cause severe health risks?,1
may i ask how well lithium works for you? i take latuda and risperidone but i am also struggling and i was diagnosed in 2014 so ive had every medication for bipolar there is but lithium and my dr suggested it but ive heard horrible things about it so im just curious on how well its worked for you  thank you ,1
depression is not just "feeling down" talk to a professional youve described some of the major symptoms of depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder i wouldnt suggest self diagnosis and i would suggest educating yourself on what major depressive disorder actually is and it is not feeling down or feeling sad as well as anxiety disorders which is where the overthinking worrying and panic seem to be getting to you you should try seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist if possible good luck its a long confusing battle but we can all do it!,1
what you described is what i suffer with on a daily basis ib have rapid bipolar severe anxiety bpd and ptsdall of which can be life threatening do not stop til you find someone that will listen to you sometimes you have to go a little bat shit crazy for them to realize the severity of it thats what i had to do let your raw emotions out on them ib know that is a very vulnerable feeling to have to do but sometimes it is necessary for them to see that something really needs to be dove to help you,0
sounds like my symptoms which are depression and anxiety on one medication for each menopause made my depression a lot worse leading to a change in antidepressant,1
sounds very much like depression & anxiety 2gether it can be debilitating see yr gp & try & get on to a psychologist or decent councillorluv to you as a fellow sufferer ,1
yes i have tried everything imaginable and still cant lose weight i have just resorted to being as healthy as possible with or without weight loss i still struggle with insecurity but at least im living,0
yupmeds slow my metabolism down to nothingweight gain is going to be a constant struggle but is better than be barking mad which i was,0
i was a mixture of scared of my own shadow and abesolutely fearlesstwo guess which caused more troublelol,1
i have bpd and i struggle with weight  i have two bowls of ceral a day and and a healthy tea lots of water and bought my self some weights from home bargins have lost two stone in four mnths good luck,0
its so horrible what some of the side effects are,0
that drug was my worst nightmare made me drool and not know it made my eyesight go i couldnt see and no-one would believe me of my symptoms it was the most horrible time in my life except for being in a straight jacket in a padded cell,0
i want to stay on my medicine the doctor is suggesting i come off through this process or i wont reach my potential and coming off medicine is scary i been on it 12 yrs,0
emdr helped me i can now think of the memories/events/triggers i have treated with emdr without feeling emotional which was a huge change still working on other things though and always still need meds i think it would be very very useful for ptsd if it works for you its not scary just feels a bitweird,0
i just read an article on emdr on the mighty and the author says it was a lot less scary than she thought it was going to be and it benefitted her a lot if i find the article ill post it here,0
i was om almost the same cocktail and when they introduced latuda for my attitudea i didnt want to live i walk from room to room confused feeling so uncomfortable in my skin and thinking if this was life i dont want it no latuda for me and the seroquel gave me night terrors if i stayed awake too long,0
hang onit really does help to write out your frustrations talking them out with a therapist or trusted friend also helps im a christian but sometimes i worry fret & over think to the point that im unable to think straight then suddenly i realize that i havent actually stopped & asked god to help me at times thats really all im able to do is ask him to help me he hasnt failed me yetas long as i give him my burdens & then trust him with whatever his will ishe loves to hear me ask he loves it when i put my faith & trust in him,0
i had severe itching all over whilst i was coming off lithium it was horrible,0
i was on the same combo but i couldnt handle the weight gain from abilify i was on effexor and trazodone only for many years until earlier this year at that point i needed more help i had a lot of suicides (friends) and just knew i couldnt take any more loss i began remeron but have noticed the weight gain again im just trying to get better at this point so weight gain is the least of my worries good luck to you and hope you can find something to work and if nothing else peace,1
i would never wish my illness "bpd" on my worst enemy! im daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones and once i do tht i feel tht i have given into the negative because now i feel i cant change this spiral but instead have incouraged it my thoughts consume the way i feel on the outside i feel tht im constantly chasing the good days i recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost bpd is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it,0
im sorry for what youre going through i have crippling anxiety as well as chronic pain throughout my back partly due to genetics and partly due to being rear-ended by an 18-wheeler ten years ago i wake up every day in constant pain and my anxiety has only gotten worse over time between the two issues i cant hold down a job and i dont feel understood at all i have a daughter to provide for and im ashamed that im not doing well financially you arent alone,0
helloforgive me for asking this questionbut why carnt you see who the person is asking for helpcan u post on the site anomously? i only ask as i spend alot of time trying to help people who postand they dont reply or follow upmaybe im getting paranoidbut it just popped in my headis this the people running the siteputting these post up to get us to respondis it just me or does anyone else get responses or conversationssorry and thank you xxx,0
thank youi think too deeply into everythingneed to be put staight sometimesvictim of my own paranoia xxx,0
i was on the same med combois the effexor xr(long acting) if so try taking it at bedtimeit can make u tired at first so u r in bed at that time if u take at night trazadone is older gen drug with tired as a major side effect although it has a "window" where its easy to fall asleep after tat if u miss your window u can end up a bit anxious and wiredso again take 30 minutes before bed and then get into bed after taking both meds and do something relaxing (cup of chamomile tea reading whatever works 4 u) after i started taking both meds at bedtime i was much more functional during the day one caution300 mg effexor is just over therapeutic upper level i know cause i used to take that doseand it can be hard on the liver which can leave u tired so ask to have liver enzymes monitored regularly this wasnt done 4 me and ive had liver problems because they didnt monitor this properly also u might want to discuss swapping trazadone with remeron soltabs at bedtime talk to your doctor this drug was better at promoting a restful sleep each night which in turn helped me cope with symptoms during the day just my experiencesif anything helps im glad i sure understand the misery when it is a challenge just to get up and go to the damn bathroom!let alone keep on top of anything else that turns us into functional depressive patients,1
hi fellow canadian here have you tried looking at programs available in your area for people with your illness? i have found we have to be the people who fight for our own health i had to go to a womans clinic and walk in doctors for a year trying to stabilize my bipolar because my doctor got very ill and when i got sick she had just gotten sick as well so i have had to really learn to navigate the system myself its not ideal but i am sure that there is a doctor who can and will listen to you and help you get better also have a full blood screening done you may have a under lying health condition that need proper treatment as they can also effect how your mind feels also if you have bipolar you are taking effexor for depression is not ideal as it can cause mania and that just makes the lows worse i find something to treat the anxiety is better at least thats what my doctor explained to me(i was on previous to treat lows and it made me worse),1
another canadian here i found there are resources out there that arent used because no one refers to them check to see if you have a mental health and addictions intake centre or a mental health resource clinic in your area dont be afraid to advocate with your doctor either,1
my daughter is going through the same thing its so hard to watch! we recently had a genetic test done (google genesight testing) that tested her dna with over 500 psychiatric medications including antidepressants mood stabilizers and anxiolytics it turns out that most of the meds she had been on werent able to be metabolized by her body so the meds never worked they gave us a report on the meds that will work and now she has hope again it might be worth a try! i think of all the years and money spent on medications that never worked and all the time shes endured the depression and anxiety waiting the 4 to 6 weeks for the meds to work and they never did im sorry youre in this dark place too right now i hope things start to get better for you and thought this might be a suggestion for you to think about good luck <3,1
jocelyn bryn also good advice "oh shift" is a book that ive read shift your way of thinking im no reader at all but have anxiety depression & stress this book was a good read,0
daily struggle,0
i have severe anxiety disorder and take paroxetine ive been on it now for 12 years i only take 20mg it really helps me best advise is to let your doctor know that what he prescribed doesnt work,1
i stopped taking medication i learned that you control youre own feelings you want to be sad so be it if you want to be happy then be happy stop dwelling on the past its behind and done with focus on today and look forward to tomorrow! all these medications are killing you slowly anyways hell if you read the side effects to all of them youll notice 99% of these things say causes depression so youre depressed and your going to take a pill that has a side effect of depression? youre going to let some little pill control your life!? it took me 2 years to get off seroquel due to the withdrawals i had i was dependint on some little pill to make me happy and sleepy now im off it feeling amazing! and losing weight! damn thing turned me into a over sized watermelon now i know not everyone is the same blah blah blah bullshit dont make an excuse if i can find happiness than so can you! if you realllllllly need to take something for youre aneixty then smoke a little weed if its illegal in youre state or country who cares get that shit! its hell of a lot healthier then those pills mind you this is my opinion so dont get all youre panties tied up in a bunch and attack me :),0
ive been on almost every drug there is since i was diagnosed in 2005 i felt hopeless in finding something tht would work but ten years ago i was prescribed seroquel and citalopram and to be honest with u i would recommend it to anyone i dont want ppl to go through wat i went through so plz give it a try tell ur doctor to start you off on 100 mg of seroquel and 10 mg of citalopram than progressively move up i have anxiety at night so i take both of these at night and i wake up fully refreshed! dnt be discouraged if you get real sleepy with them at first it takes a little while for your body to adjust to them,1
you might have to start on a smaller dose of seroquel the lowest dose is 25 i only take a small dose but it is helpful along with my other medications which includes prozac for depression anxiety and ocd and a good amount of mood stabilizers for my bipolar disorder,1
i just started it recently does a great job as a mood stabilizer but afraid of weight gain,1
feeling like you are bringing everyone and everything down regardless of thwir assurances that its not the case putting life on pause to find the right med combo and feeling guilty for that on top of it,0
its the meds well known as they cause uncontrollable eating apparently they trick the brain into thinking you have not eaten,1
thank you so much for your reply  luckily i have a friend that will be taking me to and from the gym as my anxiety is to high on buses  or i get easily irritated with people  well done you for what youve accomplished thats a lot of strength and commitment im just coming out of a bad patch so need to get active again  im not sure i could go veggie lol like meat to much  thanks for your reply,0
i really hope you arent trying to be demeaning or minimizing our struggles,0

and incredibly paranoid ocd aggressive irritable unreliable hypersexual suicidal,0
sadly im with matthew on this one my daughter has bipolar disorder and i constantly see the crazy irrational anti social angry impulsive hurtful flakey etc etc behaviour no fun for her or me :(,1
crazy irrational anti social angry impulsive hurtful flakey prone to fabricating situations in the mind based off of very little evidence and although we know the situation is not real the feelings associated with them are but yeah im nice and funny and social sometimes,0
i do it too but not much help because when im in the middle of it im not aware its happening i just irritate the snot out of everyone around me,0
i have non epileptic stress seizures from anxiety does anyone know wat this is an has anyone had one you go into space cant talk to tell people wats wrong stroke symptoms first time i was hospitalized for 3 days they had to intabate me so scary now wen i feel it coming on i take alprazolam and go in the bed,0
be open minded about it i hear theres been great success using emdr for your issues but you need to open to exploring and dont do anything youre uncomfortable with good luck!,1
i struggle too  and it has made it alot worse to fight the black dog they call depression and sadness as my mum the reason for my bieng  took her own life on the 10th march 2017 but she did raise us to be strong and that is what i am counting on  my strength ❤️,1
i feel you i finished cosmetology school last year and ive had one job then was fired after a month since then ive been spiraling almost to the point of wanting to see a psychiatrist again ive been med free 8 years and too scared to go back i wanna get an evaluation done and go through my medical records and see if my diagnosis is still the same of if theres anything new im finding it hard to call places back that i apply to and i find it hard to even get my career going i cant live at home with my parents supporting me forever im a damn trainwreck and somehow i manage i still wanna live even if its exhausting,0
i am with you i am rapid cycling right now i have a new dr and is switchin everything around and im going thru some serious life changing bull shit i am so tited of everything i just cant deal aanymore its so overwhelming idk who to even talk to any more i did talk to my wife but nowim too bipolar for her its just nutsso i feel your pain hang in there thats alaa we cando best wishes,0

just dont be discouraged! take one minute at a time than one day at a time there is no use of stressing for something we cannot control and no use on stressing on something on tht hasnt occurred just some food for thought ,1
well i had such a horrible feeling today so anxious but i remembered what you wrote and guess what i feel so much better sure tomorrow will be more positive,0
us with bpd put more pressure on ourselves bc we think more and stress more than normal ppl do im on seroquel and citalopram it works great for me i get a long nights rest it will help you,1
i would never wish my illness "bpd" on my worst enemy! im daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones and once i do tht i feel tht i have given into the negative because now i feel i cant change this spiral but instead have incouraged it my thoughts consume the way i feel on the outside i feel tht im constantly chasing the good days i recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost bpd is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it,0
i take doxepin at night along with prozason i am bipolar with high anxiety ptsd i do ok pray you find peace,1
i was put on prazosin 2 months ago this medication is a blood pressure medication yet they found it helps some people with nightmares & sleep problems (usually do to ptsd) my dr told me to pay attention to how im feeling while taking it i dont suffer from high blood pressure therefore i had to make sure it wasnt causing low blood pressure i found i couldnt tolerate taking it every day it made me feel worn out & my heart was doing overtime i experimented a little with it now i only take it when i dont have anything important to do the next day taking it daily wasnt working at all for me the longer i took it the more tired i became & eventually my blood pressure was too low it can be a good drug for some people i recommend monitoring your blood pressure & lack of energy i hated it when i took it daily now that i dont take it every night i really love it,1
so sorry that you have to struggle like that some times its not fair,0
i have anxiety depression and ptsd and they put me on prasozin and i saw an increase in my night terrors and sleepwalking last week they switched me to trazodone and it seems helpbut the hangover affect sucks,1
i have borderline personality disorder and bipolar i as borderlines we wear our emotions or hearts on our sleeves we protect those who we dearly love and if you make us upset youll know it quickly i have severe trust issues if that tells you anything i dont take criticism very well either bpd is caused by a traumatic event at some point in our early lives you have to be a strong enough person to handle someone with bpd we can be quite emotional borderline just means we feel anger hurt depression 100x worse than the "normal" individual we can say things that we dont mean if were upset and those things can be pretty cruel at times this is the "i hate you but dont leave me!" mental health issue im just being 100% honest here if you can find a way to calmly talk to us then a bpd relationship is for you if you get upset easily nah it wont work my husband has been with me for almost 13 years now it can be done if you communicate effectively we can be quite possessive of the people we love and when youve done something wrong we have no problems cutting you out permanently were epic at silent treatments its like we need to protect ourselves from feeling that pain from that traumatic event again if we sense theres anything amiss were out of there psst but we love sex (at least some of us really do)! ;),0
im on board with honesty and trustwithout which i dont think you have any chance of making it work i have bpd and "bipolar tendencies" whatever the hell that is lol my partner of almost 20 years has bipolar disorder we tattooed trust on ourselves in someplace we see at the beginning to make sure we never forgot our commitment to making it the foundation of our relationship then we spent the next 20ish years being completely honest with one another we might not always like what each of us has to say but the honesty helps keep things transparent these disorders will complicate your life enoughdont add anything else in the mix that would confuse or complicate the relationship that being said you can understand the demons each other faces better than a "healthy person" you can sympathize with the issues your partner faces youll be proud of their success because youll know what it cost the only thing sometimes youll have to put a disagreement or discussion off till later because when the disorder is running the show u cant have a rationale conversation u have to wait till your partner is back in charge to have some talks i wouldnt want to live without my bipolar partner im grateful every day we were willing to take a chance on us! love always !!! ✨❤✨ ✨❤✨,0
hello everybody my name is dan i suffer from depression & anxiety ive had counselling & it comes back to abandoned issues ive recently come back from the states after being with my fiancé for 10 weeks she has "something" but hasnt been diagnosed yet im not going thro the good & bad times we had but she was having such a negative impact on my life that i had to call it off & would remain friends i cant do the friends thing after being intimate with someone ive tried for the last 2 months & she isnt the person she once was weather its because of the change of meds or whatever i slowly got no answers to questions & finally not even reading my messages this is day 2 that i havent messaged her & she hasnt messaged me it is very hurtful but im not "cutting" or planning suicide (2 attempts) so i am doing well even if i dont feel like it i guess just enjoy your dates make no future plans enjoy their company while your with them  if i read this back to myself it probably wont make any sense but i tried to help somebody else out & thats going to be my happy thought for the day everybody regardless of what you have or havent got im a person that doesnt judge you all the best to "yall" ✌️ love&peace from little new zealand ,0
our relationship was extremely toxic and ended horribly come to find outwe both needed hospitalization she is bpd and i ambi polar everyones relationship is different best wishes buddy,1
i would never wish my illness "bpd" on my worst enemy! im daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones and once i do tht i feel tht i have given into the negative because now i feel i cant change this spiral but instead have incouraged it my thoughts consume the way i feel on the outside i feel tht im constantly chasing the good days i recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost bpd is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it,0
i have both on top​ of anxiety thyroid disease and hypoglycemia its a ride let me tell you especially with a hormone related disease on top​of everything ive stabbed my fiance in the leg with a fork when i was angry with him of course i refuse to take medicine for the mental disorders,0
thnk u so much for the caring and kind words unfortunately my father was not a good man he was an alcoholic and would beat on my mom and younger sister and i hated him for tht i never have a good role model growing up so tht is why i think i am doubtful of being a good dad bc i never had a good dad to teach me about morals,0
i understand how you feelmost of the time because we feel that way dont make it soi think it should be their choice to see you instead of you deciding for themyou dont need guilt trips added to what you already have going onjust let them know you are there & will do what you can to the best of your ability fear can really mess with our livesit has been awhile sometimes its best to let sleeping dogs liei dont know the situation on the other end but i can & will pray for yousometimes people dont or cant understand what others go through until they experience it themselvesyou can say all the buts and i woulds truth being yall dont knowgod bless you!,0
ive had two failed marriages and havent seen my two boys in ten years i have failed as a father and choose to be aloof bc im scared to be a disappoint to them now making me feel disappointed in myself,0
that is so wrong i only struggle with depression and anxiety so i dont know what its like but i do know that its not how u treat some one im sorry u had to deal with that,0
i have bpd and from my own experience i need a lot of attention and love if i dont get it i can slip into a bad mood which ends up turning into a whole lot worse at times! i need a lot of listening and understanding even when im babbling on about stupid small things lots of hugs i take a lot out on my partner at times when the world hurts me i get upset at him and hes gone a very long way to figure out what to do with the situation and what not to do with it we still struggle at times and as far as we know he doesnt have a "disorder/label" like we do to add to the mix! it takes a lot of hard work but its so good when you do get to a point where you both understand enough about each other to not affect each other negatively ❤️ the best part about your situation is that you can get each other on a different level with your experiences dealing with your conditions! and you can take your meds together which is always a bonus as i forget mine too often hahaha and always remember that things said and done cant be undone so a but of space between the two of you is a blessing as long as its communicated to the other properly ❤️,0
i have taken it since august 2000 twice ended up in hospital due to toxic poisoning this last time cold turkey high dose and just had it stopped not "weaned off" as should be awful side effects literally felt electric shocks all over inside body then painful after shower drying myself skin so much pain felt sleepy really dopey feeling like spaced out! scary didnt feel in control at all! off altogether then restarted on small dose for just over a week then dose doubled and some symptoms came back so now back to low dose!!! extremely important to get bloods checked properly mine werent and ill through no fault of my own!!,0
hmmm my meds fucked me up ive been on tons of different medication and each time i get worse i currently off of meds and even feel worse (if anyone has had a med that works let me know) ive been on prozac celexa wellbutrin lamictal lorazapam ambien and even lithium none have helped ive even had the anti-anxiety ones such as xanax but nothing helps i might be a hopeless case,1
hi i have bipolar 1 as does my sister and mother i remember back in 2012 when i was convinced my teeth were falling out i could feel every single one of them moving when i spoke when i ate the only way i can describe my mood throughout that episode was utter terror all day everyday i didnt eat i examined my teeth i went to 4 different dentists and 2 gps (before diagnosis ) i ended up trying to ply them out if my mouth until i was sedated with diazepam  the only way i coped at times was to distract myself with painting  i cant explain it but it really helps medont get me wrong the anxiety creeps through always  the other day i was on a low i got really overdramatic about the price of fags and how its not fair to do this to me bla bla bipolar blaaaaanyway i made this through spite and it went viralwhich sent me into a hypo and i painted the whole flat bipolar is weird lol xxx,0
it is not me but a family member that has this struggle it breaks my heart for i want to make it all better but have to accept that all i can do at this point is love and pray,0
i have bipolar 2 and anxiety i was first diagnosed at 24 and am now 46 one thing i have learned is that medication is necessary in ny life you have to coime to terms with your illnesses,1
i completely understand how you feel it is a struggle to accept that you have no control over your own feelings i have had many similiar experiences it is hurtful not being accepted because of it i have learned to not be ashamed that i have these illnesses but i still try to protect myself from shallow people,0
hi rachel how are you?i am struggling with the terms that i have an illness as a matter of fact i hate the stereotypeas soon as the subject comes up people dont want anything to do with ya ,0
i also have bipolar 2 with major depression anxiety and ptsd been battling it a long time i agree that the best thing is to just roll with it but that doesnt mean doing nothing with a supportive doctor the right therapist and right medication life can be managed quite well that doesnt mean perfect there will be down times but with the right therapy these can be managed well just remember to ask for help when you need it definitely baby steps i wish you all the very best,1
i use/still do fear/worry about that alottbh ive learnt to try my best everyday no matter what im just gonna keep fighting everyday be a strong person and there are always others around me to keep a smile on my face and i realised also theres always someone looking out for methank goodness :),0
it has already has my marriage ended i lost my career and i am so scared so depressed and have so much anxiety and panic that things will never be the same and i feel hopeless,0
i have bad depression and anxiety i have been very depressed at times that i start thinking that sometimes being gone out of this world would be better but then i think of my family and the true friends that i have now and i feel better been on meds dont work though but i fight and keep fighting to get better i pray that someday i will get better i wont give up,0
i worry about this every second i wonder who i could be miss who i was ive lost my chance at a career because of this depression and anxiety ,1
no doubt this has happened to me,0
for me right now it is like i am having a dream after so many years of my life waking up every day to nightmares there is hope i am living proof i have my life back after being diagnosed with bipolar anxiety and ptsd 20 years ago i try to enjoy my life everyday while i have been stable these past 5 years and not take my life for granted i now work as peer support specialist at kings view for the oakwellness center and use my life journey with mental illness to inspire mentor and empower others and let them know there is hope we are so much stronger than we think,0
my gp seems really hesitant to refer to me a psyche i dont know why :/ ive asked about it before,0
im diagnosed bipolar 2 and yeah that seems pretty consistent with my days keep a journal try to keep details such as how long youre feeling a certain way how those feelings are and things you do (much like this post) the days/weeks i consider my "up" days (symptoms of mania showing) i try to channel that energy into positive things (going on a run getting school work done yard work chores piano etc) and days that im down i just acknowledge that im ok its just the disorder messing with me and mentally get myself encouraged enough to go for my run even if it turns into more of a walk or a short jog normally at least getting moving and outside kickstart my days really well and gets me over that depression hump but most importantly keep in contact with your doctor the reason bipolar is so dangerous is the "mixed" episodes that can begin to occur where you have thoughts/feelings of depression and anxiety but the energy/drive of a manic episode which turns into a combination that leads to self harm for that reason its super important to try and stay a step ahead of the disorder and work with your doc to stay as clear headed as possible during my stay in a psych hospital and therapy learning as much as i could about cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me every single day and helps me be much more independent,0
thank you i didnt want anyone to diagnose me i was just freaking out a bit last night because i went from super high to super low and im terrified of the doctor so i didnt want to go there and make a fool of myself if it was nothing my gp is trying to sway me away from seeing a psyche i dont know why maybe im that crazy and she knows ill be sectioned or something if i see one lol,0
bond michele bond this sounds super familiar because its really gotten more severe since ive been on citalopram now with the addition of mirtazapine im worried thatll make it worse again,0

ryan i have been on anti-anxiety and anti-depressants for many years they have made all the difference in the world for me i explained my symptoms to my doctor and she gave me a prescription so much better than being so anxious i would get panic attacks in restaurants because of all the people around me,0
kalli mccauley me all day everyday i hate anxiety,1
stop sayin bi polar is all psychotic symptoms its not i do feel ghosts on my bed and i believe like many people who dont have bi polar do still believe in ghosts etc just cos i have this illness everyone thinks its imagination nope there is a thing of being psychic not psychotic thats me no silly or horrible answers please i have my faith and watch ghost programmes i believe in life after death for good people on earth again u state stop saying we are barmy cos of our illness i do not imagine any of my experiences,0
im in my 28th year of my bipolar struggle but the last 5-6 years have been devastating in the number of psychotic episodes ive hadthey are erratic in length and come way to often sometimes just days between them and i just cant take itmy psychiatrist is just as confused as i amblahhhhjust this year alone ive had 5 manic episodesi just hide away trying to find ways to burn off the energy and i am bad at spending big because i become obsessive in the need to buy lots of stuff for my hobby so no shops and ban ebay and i know confining myself is counter productive because i become paranoid and it just builds up and then the voices starti cant win,0
the struggle is real since turning 30 getting hard to manage my symptoms,0
im all the above and to my family and friends sorry for hiw ive turned out but pease take me as iam or just dont bother speaking to me and except me as iam sorry for any embarrassment i bring on my family but i really do need you all to understand how iam,0
im so sorry you are struggling your words are deep and i totally relate im not good at conveying my feelings due to my anxiety i guess so what you wrote hits home for me ill say a prayer for you whether you believe in god or not because thats what i do ❤,0
regardless of whether a side effect is normal or not unless your doctor told you it would happen and dont worry about it you should call him/her and let them know they cant help you if they dont know what is happening especially true when trying to find the right meds make sure you let them know you are still taking your meds but u wanted them to know how you are reacting to them,0
i take 90mgs of cymbalta a day also valproate yes l do get a few tremors but l think it is quite normal after years of mis diagnosis and and a very miserable life a few tremors are nothing your gp should be able to find the right combination for you good luck,1
thats normal with many psych meds usually itll subside within a month worse case scenario it may take 2 months if they do not subside within 2 months please tell your doctor what is happening ive had medications where i started having involuntary facial movements if this occurs on any medication you want to tell your dr right away this could become permanent if the drug is not discontinued its not as scary as it sounds but thats one side effect you need to be sure to tell your dr about good luck to you:-),1
hi i suffer from bp disorder and i took latuda and at a certain dosage both my right hand and right leg shook horibly i believe its a side affect i changed meds read the info that comes with your meds tell your dr! bless you!,1
bipolar can be extremely happy without worrying about being manic i can if youre lopsided on your meds and inclined to the depressive you need an adjustment from say anti depressants to mood stabilizers but i can assure you it is very easy to be happy and positive with bipolar,1
been struggling the last few days i cant sleep :(,0
i understand but i dont feel  i fight myself battles of inner turmoil,0
perspective: opium is all natural many drugs are obtained from plants all natural isnt better or worse than drugs that are manufactured in a lab and unfortunately it sometimes mean unknown and changing concentration of the active ingredient which can lead to overdose it can also mean made in someones kitchen and contaminated cause they were distracted which can make you sick or worse and certain all natural remedies can interact badly with some medication st johns wort should never be taken with antidepressants that are selective serotonin or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors the interaction can be very bad if you want to add a "natural remedy" it is also a drug and you should talk to your doctor before taking it better safe than sick or worse,1
i have been talking to my therapost which is a military ptsd specialist he is not a fan of scrip drugs and says the side effects are very dangerous he believes exercise like hiking good diet talking and cbd oil are a good combo to start with i as well uave been on benzos and they are highly addicting i thoght i wa going to die getting off of zanax quiet calm is my key when im gong to louder situations i hike before hand to make sure im am grounded i think the best thing is to avoid things that are difficult until you have the confidence to deal your body and mind have alarm systems telling you if your taking or doing something wrong listen to it,0
i am prescribed xanax when i first started taking benzos the dr told me to take one 3 times a day i was in college at the time i couldnt remember shit so i learned to only take them when i am having a panic attack or going into a situation i know will cause an anxiety attack when taking benzos this way the medication doesnt make you feel drowsy & forget things if you only take it as needed it simply calms you down & stops anxiety attacks be careful with benzos they are addictive & you will build up a tolerance if you take it when you dont need it with that said some people need them i recommend not taking them as instructed that is usually why people get into trouble with them they build up a tolerance then you have nothing to combat your worst anxiety to lessen my dependants on xanax when i feel anxious i take a product sold by thorne research its called "pharma gaba" for panic attacks take your benzo med i also take the pharma gaba 250 for sleep they use to have to give me heavy sedatives for me to sleep this product works better & you dont feel weird/hungover the next morning gaba also isnt habit forming/addictive i also recommend cannabis oil most people arent aware that it is legal for anyone to buy cannabis oil as long as it doesnt contain thc cbd oil can be purchased online and delivered to your door check out "charlottes web" there are many other places to purchase it as well,1
yes its herbal i had taken it in texas from heb its a tonic im sure they will have it listed it did work for a while they also have other tonics like happy mood etc its like taking st johns wort for depression you can look up and try different types of herbs for anxiety cbd oil is real good mood lifter,1
mine actually told me to for once finish what i started about four months after i tried to commit suicide they are horrible people leave him before it gets worse because it always will,0
that is an unbelievably horrible thing to say to someone who is not well and cruel i might call it abusive you need somebody whos going to treasure you and help you not try to push you over the edge what is it? control? its very very toxic and you need to keep yourself safe,0
horrible man you deserve way better than that do not listen to that man!,0
i told an abusive partner who "used" suicide as a threat to manipulate me i once told him if he did it wouldnt be my fault taken out of context those are unbelievably horrible words to say to someone whos just said theyre suicidal so i understand this person just wanting more context may not change the outcome obviously that was a bad relationship for the both of us,0
i may be able to help you two out as i see kaylas point and actually agree but i see kimberly disliked your comment while yes it is a medical term and here it is being used in a proper connotation ( be it controversial) kim i believe youre upset because they didnt say intellectual disability correct?? i may be off base so sorry to assume im just trying to be a friendly gap bridger both are correct but i know " intellectual disability" is more pc and the more current term however before id the term mental retardation was used as a correct description of intellectual and mental deficits so yes in a medical support poster although the term is a little outdated its still not made to belittle or mock id just a older term for the same thing medicine is always evolving and so are we this was made to support and bring attention to many causes not bring down one i also would like to note that i believe whoever made this poster may not be in a medical field or have a strong medical background because narcolepsy is listed i have narcolepsy but thats not a mental disorder its neurological so perhaps the person responsible meant well just wasnt fully informed i believe they really did mean to be supportive but just didnt know better to use the term id,1
when i first started it i had a similar reaction as well as getting an upset stomach i started taking it before i went to bed instead of in the morning which helped heaps and it settled down after a couple of weeks been the best medication for me out of all the ones ive tried,1
there is no doubt from your words you are pretty desperate and struggling to cope i guess many questions come to mind such as do you have parents? are they aware of your mental health problems? if they do are they supportive? also do you have a good doctor? i guess you may be in the us while im in the uk where doctors are readily and freely available and you can change around until you find the best for you when i was really in a bad way (unfortunately im way older but there are still similarities) plus my teenage son has had acute anxiety and depression my brother too when i was ill i was adamant i wouldnt take sleeping tablets see a counsellor or go onto anti depressant medication i wouldnt even admit to start with that i had depression until i ended up on the edge of a breakdown and knew for my sake as well as my families something had to change i have had a lot of problems with staff at my sons high school pushing him and had an email recently adding more pressure saying he was going to fail his exams and wouldnt be able to continue next year this approach is not helping applies more pressure on him when he is already not coping and makes him feel a failure some of the things hes told me how he feels over the years are heartbreaking things you never want to hear as a mother but im so relieved tho he can tell me and i want to know how he feels so i can help accordingly i have explained to him its not about failing or succeeding if his exam results arent great then i d like him to be able to think he hasnt achieved quite as well as hed hoped but thats not a problem its not insurmountable and really it doesnt matter there is so much pressure here and probably similar there on our young people to succeed in their studies its far too much pressure on their young shoulders as a society we need to back off gently encourage and be kind im sure this would be far more affective than frightening and bullying them mental illness isnt being stupid weak or a failure our brains are the most complex organ like other parts of our bodies sometimes they dont work so well we all need a helping hand from time to time and until the world takes mental illness seriously and stop being unkind impatient and not understanding then thousands and thousands of people suffer in relative silence its all wrong reach out hun tell those who love you how you really feel if they truly love you they will understand its not for you to make them they have the responsibility to understand and to help look again at small but significant steps to make you better do you need something to help your bad periods? are they causing deficiencies in your body? medication can be a temporary crutch to help you get back on track during a particularly busy time can you talk to your lecturer? jot down some notes so you dont forget im sure your mind might be completely jumbled how can you study effectively when you feel like this im not telling you what to do just looking at options support is one of the most important things along with consideration and kindness you need people to give you a break but if they arent aware of the full facts then they might not be able to help properly dont push loved ones away with depression we can feel so alone but we also try to isolate ourselves too thinking of you and hold on to hope that it will get better there is always hope look after yourself x,0
tell them dont be ashamed!,0
mine is also the worst then its been my experience that professors in the field of education are very accomodating to disabilities whether physical academic or mental health related you are not weak or fragile; you are suffering from a disease that inhibits your day to day life talk to them,1
i find my anxiety and depression get worse when its that time of the month i dropped out of college because it was so bad now that im on medication again its getting a lot better i also was diagnosed with ibs definitely talk to your educator or email then about whats going on im sure they will understand and figure something out,1
tell them trust me it was the hardest but best thing i ever did was to ask for help and accept that i am the way i am i still struggle but i have some support now i still have days i wish people didnt know as i am paranoid that people will talk about me and think im weak but they cant help if they dont know we are fighters not failures and you can do this doesnt matter if it happens now or after a break if you need time to rebalance it should be treated no different to if you broke your arm or had a physical illness xx,0
the time of the month is my trigger for depressive episodes something about the hormones i would tell your school they can usually make exceptions for medical conditions my friend received extra time to complete tests i went through failing out of school before i decided to go back on medication now that im on meds im going back to school this fall dont be afraid to ask for help and be open to medicine hang in there!,0
i get all of these other than the sex 1 but not been tested for bipolar or anything other than depression and anxiety,1
and down somewhere the darkest road something follows me i am not alone because misery loves my company - dean winchester (supernatural ),0
youll be fine but i yes the struggle his real! its okay to reach out and ask for support! stay encouraged!,0
hahahaand they say im paranoid! ha!,0
i agree with you 100% but when i have to piss test for a job even though i have a prescription its still not allowed but i need something for my extreme public anxiety and depression,1
just the thought of that makes me anxious ;),0
talk with your doctor about seroquel i dont know how old u r but it is black boxed in the us for older people the elderly have a heightened risk of death from this med other annoying side effects include high blood sugar and orthostatic hypotension which is a fancy way of saying when u chafe position too fast (sit or stand up) your blood pressure can really drop and u can fall down or black out this is a drug with a lot of side effects you should talk to your doctor and evaluate the pros and cons todecide if this is the best drug for u,0
yes ive struggled with this my whole life,0
get well and glad you have someone to support you i am a struggling bp consumer blessings!,0
it doesnt require "lived experience" but it helps well done for reaching out and finding someone that understands it takes great courage to admit that you are vulnerable i have bipolar affective disorder 1 and although i am stable  3 years now  and have access to a best practice mental health in-patient hospital with out-patient care on the darkest of nights  i have used authoritative online communities like bphopecom keep safe reach out get well,1
my personal love relationship with jesus is the reason ive gotten through depression and anxiety i always run to him when anxiety hits and speak his word into the problem,1
for me god and religions are what contribute to my severe anxiety,1
yeah you clearly dont know how anxiety works,1
if were all smart enough to know with certainty that god doesnt exist anxiety should be small fry ive been fighting with this shit since i was 17 im now 38 so i think i can consider myself something of a veteran even so im not willing to rule out anything that might help even one sufferer find a way out of this horrible shit its this hypersensitive response to suggestions that stops people finding a way out!!!,0
sometimes the brain is just uncontrollable :(,0
i believe in god i pray for help and to be healed god made me this way  its a daily struggle believing in a higher power wont cure this disease,0
please remove this ridiculous and damaging post immediately shame on you!,0
no curing anxiety is not as easy as just turning to god by that logic just turning to god should cure a person of cancer or save them from dying of a fatal disease just like that and im pretty sure a lot of people with bipolar depression and anxiety who follow god are actually decent christians yet they still have those conditions this post is as bad as "just think positive" or "just relax",1
very inappropriate im disappointed even if youre a person of faith god is not the answer for a person with a biological illness shame on you,0
so he haves a plan to kill us all that still does not solve all our problems while we wait for the death to finally come around anxiety happens god is not an answer,0
if there was a god he wouldnt have given you anxiety in the first place some imaginary creation is just going to make your mental health worse because your believing in something thats not real! if you want to beat your anxiety its all on you its hard work but you can do it i just get the odd moments now it was hard work but i pushed through myself with no imaginary friends,0
anxiety happens when i have clinical anxiety and ptsd,1
that fuckers so called plan was to give me crippling anxiety god can kiss my ass,1
the gods have a plan the plan is for us to live in such a way that we exemplify something noteworthy even if its just being strong and brave enough to do what scares the bleedin hell out of you also not being a dick because someone posts something you may not agree with because all opinions and views exist here and not every neutral post speaks to everyones specific life so you can let this go and let the ones who need to see this get some help too,0
i wish i could stop being so nervousit wears me out,1
wow you sound a lot like the church counselor who told me that the reason i have depression and anxiety and am suicidal is because i was doing things god didnt want me to do fuck off for real,1
so many people so many offended by this just a quote for one and for another its just giving you an out so you dont have to worry its a "god" of your understanding it clearly did not say be christian or be anxious wow!,0
i have lived with anxiety for about 20 years also social anxiety which i have under control thanks to support groups and plenty of coping skills my meds are a very low dose so i rely on what i have been taught in therapy and especially group therapy i strongly suggest going to mental health or behavioral health and taking these groups i believe from my own experiences meds alone didnt fix my diagnosis in fact i was over medicated and my life was falling apart i lost count but i have been hopsitalized 12 times and i understand having resentment to god as to why he would do this to me thorazine shots haldol shots five point restraint isolation rooms taking my friends and family away who i loved with all my heart it was the excessive force or several beatings i have taken from up to five male staff members and hearing two female staff members screaming for them to stop saying your hurting him but they didnt stop i guess they were tryng to teach me a lesson not to stand up for others or myself so i stopped praying for many years mad at god luckily my faith in god kept me from ending my life someone questioned gods plan and i understand i know work for the mental health system and i am a board member for behavioral health and work for kings view as a certified peer support specialist you see god wasnt done with my journey and now i see his plan clearly everything i have been through i believe happened for a reason so i can help others just like,1
you have anxiety ? as a condition  im a christian and i think this post is unnecessary and did thoughtless ,0
god cannot do anything  dont you get it  he was beaten up by his own people and was slammed to the cross just like we are about to be smoked by our very own artificial intelligence robot  i acquired anxiety along the way because i let it and i can beat it  fuck anxiety  im the the saviour of my own not anyone or some heavenly beings ive read about but have never met or seen,0
there are people of diverse faiths no faiths and views that follow and like this page and as you can see this post has caused quite a stir and upset amongst your followers id hate to see your page fail or lose followers because of such posts so all i ask is you be careful about what you post please thank you,0
oh good my anxiety went through the roof then,1
my anxiety is bad right now i keep praying and talking to god,1
god has a plan for my anxiety? and what is that?? ,1
same boatmy mother was unattached with me since birthshes very religious so wherever i have pointed out my mental issues (depression and anxiety) she says its all because i abandoned the churchand if i would just come back to "the lord" i would be completely healedmost of the time we end up in a severe argument and she hangs up on meso ive stopped trying to make her understandshes set in her ways and shes 85,0
im only 21 years old ive already been on lots on medication that hasnt helped and had counselling which helped for about 5 minutes but now its worse i never want to go out because of my depression and anxiety i have to be made to go out otherwise i just wouldnt i work 6 days a week which is hard for me some days every day i have at least one person saying to me why do you look so miserable all of time or pick your face up off the ground or snap out of it which makes me feel worse cause it doesnt matter how many times you tell them people you cant help it they still make you feel crap and just dont understand people who dont suffer with depression honestly do not get it and it is very frustrating im not living anymore im just exsisting additional comment from the original poster,0
its so hard when you feel as bad as you do severe depression is all encompassing it defines you and takes over your whole life everyday is pretty much the same in terms of desperation sorrow and trying to battle the demons in your head when you are least able i remember all too clearly day after day week after week being sofa bound willing the endless days to end having no strength or drive to be able to change things or get better the trouble is recovering from severe depression involves so many things and all of which involve strategies which seem almost alien and impossible to implement it can seem such a monumental task and when the task seems so huge i think it is almost impossible to believe you can ever make it happen dont give up on that hope when there is hope there is a chance i know it can seem so far away or so difficult to find that contentment or inner peace we all crave but you can do it you ve come this far you must congratulate yourself for doing so well to get this far when your mind is leading you astray whilst i was wasting my life and just existing not living i wanted escape constantly not wanting this life but because i lived through the carnage of my closest friend and relatives suicide i knew that just wasnt the answer i wanted escape but not that i knew there had to be another way there are so many questions id need to ask about your support if you have any medication if you have access to professional services im in the uk and i suspect you are in the us and services might not be available or affordable i am no expert just someone who cares and understands able mental illness and the hideous affect it can have and the intolerance and ignorance which exists in the world i finally reached the realisation that no one else would get me off that sofa only me i had to find the determination and strength to do it i owed it to myself i came up with a plan i wasnt going to waste any more life a goal for the future some big things eg find some meaningful voluntary work some small eg sit in the sunshine many things were involved from sleeping tablets to give me a welcome respite to getting counselling so many things contributed and were necessary from trying to eat better to reaching out to loved ones admitting i needed them im not pretending it was quick and im still on the path but im now working and have a completely different life i call it my new life after depression big steps are not necessary because they are unachievable small achievable but significant steps are the ones that can work tiny goals but steps forward not back dont try to run before you can walk my aim is to write a book one day but for now i am happy to enjoy the little pleasures in life confirmation i have made it through and there is no going back best wishes thoughts and hope to you there is a better way xx,0
to this i would say you dont want it to all be over if you did this wouldnt have got wrote its hard being in a dark place even more so when u can see yourself pushing loved ones away because your already scared they will leave you and pushing them away just heighten that feeling and then that makes u worse first you need to find a smile not a fake one for any means necessarya tv show a childs innocent smile once u have that slight brake thru now you need to grab hold of that and look deep find out whats making you angry more than not be aimed at yourself and work with it its only way i get thru them and when i get angry i like it i feed on it but i get a moment of clarity and thats what i grab hold of dont think about giving up that wont make u better that makes all your loved ones worse and possibly on the road that your on now,0
lonely serenity peace turmoil,0
i had that with jess now my stress is threw the roof,0
first off your illness had nothing to do with what you did 10 year olds know right from wrong no amount of rumors made you do it either blaming your illnesses is wrong because you do have conscious smh secondly whats done is done the past is the past for a reason as far as wanting forgiveness ruining a teachers welfare and reputation probably isnt going to be fixed with im sorry so you were illno pass sorry you knew what you were doing you even said you felt guilt  you just need to live with it and move on ,0
ill tell you what id do  write him a letter explaining the truth  its eating you alive and you need to apologize to move past it  give it to the headmaster and make peace with the fact its part of the past and think of it like this  it can rest on him  if he wants to hate you  give him that option but it puts "it" on him and releases the guilt for you  once you know you did the right thing by letting him know how you feel about it as in it bothers you to the point of interfering with your life! you should feel better because youve done everything in your power to show him you acknowledge the damage you caused  he might hate you but its gotta feel rewarding to know it hurts you :/  if thats true if not hell forgive you  either way forgive yourself you know your sorry!,0
reach out to bipolar support groups and mental health education outreach programs and try to find a way to have professionals go to schools and educate adolescents who are vulnerable and susceptible to mental illness you can help prevent this from happening again sometimes its best to leave the past alone so you dont drag up old feelings and just try to pay it forward,1
focus on righting your wrong through future actions make sure you talk to preteens about bullying etc dont feel so eternity guilty its done and over with as an adult go speak to the headmaster have a meeting with the teacher and the headmaster if explaining your actions will calm your guilt if they will not hear you write a letter,0
shaming someone is never useful shes trying to dig herself out of shame unless you are without flaws i would suggest some kindness,0
ummm im sorry bad mouthing her did not ruin her life it may have made it suck quite a bit he on the other hand could have gotten jail timelost his job lost friends and family the list goes on and on his life would have been ruined i agree the whole situation in general sucks and she was by all accounts still a child and mentally ill at that but dont compare the two ive been bullied and had rumors about me in school its nothing compared to what he would have dealt with also 2 wrongs dont make a right oh he said something bad so i can retaliate no it sounds like shes better and everyone has moved on except her sense of guilt i say to just let it go if there is no permanent damage you should seek counseling to help you move past im sorry all this happened but as long as you hold yourself accountable and move past it youll hopefully be okay,0
what about the teacher bad mouthing first?? he destroyed this girls life and she retaliated by doing the same both to blame im afraid i do not condone anything i have read in this topic but im just saying the damage has been done people know the truth sometimes its just best to let sleeping dogs lie and try to move on from this it could have been worse and it wasnt so you are really lucky there best of luck to you and i hope you manage to forgive yourself because unfortunately you will most likely never forget,0
exactly why my mom gets the worst of my venting  im not mean but im tough on her  she also has bipolar personality disorder anxiety and life long addiction issues  would do anything in the world for her though  you are clearly her rock!,1
when you cant say anything correct to someone with bipolar disorder try just listening even if it means listening to us cry she isnt in control of her actions my mother has often been my life line even though i have said horrible things to her she knows me & still loves me possibly you are the only person she thinks loves her unconditionally,0
i spent years lashing out at the people i love desperately looking for someone or something to blame for my bipolar disorder and desperately projecting my fear anger and confusion onto others in vain efforts to dissipate or lessen the pain i felt in time i learned that peoples patience however much they love you has to be finite for their sake and their emotional wellbeing mental illness always has collateral damage and its those closest to us who suffer when we do now i have a baby daughter i have made a choice that i will always work to protect her from any potential ills my condition brings that primarily involves being active in my wellbeing taking responsibility for my behaviour and owning my mind again its far from easy it often takes greater effort than i am able to give but for her sake and for those i love i keep going good luck to you both x,0
i do the same thing but to my dad and bf its a chemical inbalanceand a safe comfortable person to take it out on the ones you love bc they probably wont leave you i get paranoid she just needs to find the right meds takes a while  go see her take her calls she just is ill right now we all want our mom and dad when were sick she will get well shes totally the way i am my poor parents and bf friends and family ,0
in aa and na they say ✨ fine is: fu**ed up insecure neurotic and emotional i always thought it was a good explanation of the fine i was,0

its sad that people are actually just care about your wounds on your wrists not your wounded soul most of people these days when you tell em you have mental illnesses will avoid you and start to see you like a monster,0
to all my friends in the struggle,0
been therefound a great pyschologist who i could be totally honest with and by sharing my feelings ive gotten to the point of being able to manage it--with an anti-depressanttwo months ago i was hit with a trifecta of negative news and spent two weeks in bed--fear of going back into prolonged depression i decided to stop being a victim of my sickness and have largely grown out of depression,1
but do a lot of research on strains because just like pharma meds certain strains can make life worse heres a handy website on strain info leaflycom,1
she ahould be my alarm lol,0
i got that too im disabled dont follow a usual schedule the therapist pretty much has me convinced to quit kicking myself about it when it happens my husband is very understanding i quit all my sleeping meds and just ride it out no fun but no guilt or self hate either,0

nah i dont want to die by suicide the last thing id want is someone making bad remarks they never put good makeup on you when you die its always the cheapest makeup then they embalm you and make your boobs stick out like dolly parton and looking like a vampire even though i love vampires just isnt my style its never the expensive makeup its always the hot pink or bright pink lipstick and boy they pack on the blush its always the hot pink blush i dont know about you but they have awful tastes in makeup for the dead why should we care about makeup? i dont want to look like a hooker (apologies to hookers) in a coffin look were all in debt but that isnt a good enough reason to kill yourself hey wave your pills if youre in student loan debt (waves pills)! and no parent thinks of their child as a burden i love to argue with my kids (even if they think they know-it-all) i still love my babies even when theyre 100 you have to form a bucket list of what you want to do in life its time to start living i just exfoliated with a charcoal sugar mask and my face feels tight i want to go to athens greece ive never been i want to see the mediterranean sea i dont know why i just want to see it so youre in debt we all have debts lawd i think my face will freeze and ill look like janice dickinson make a list on things you want to live for and do it even if youre in debt it isnt the end of the world you may think it is but debt isnt something to worry about i wish i could ((hug)) you in person so you have to settle for this pathetic web ((hug)) thats the best i can do youve just been hugged how do you like them apples?,0
youll be surprise that people will except you and every time i meet somebody they cant believe my life or my mental illness im very open about it and i do tell people i go to therapy i will probably go to therapy for the rest of my life and i dont and i dont care if anybody knows or if somebody does not want to be my friend because of it but thats just my personality i come through so much that im not going to apologize for my past that has shaped me into the person that i am so whatever you need to do to help yourself thats the path you should take but taking your life will never be the answer take it from somebody that tempted it three timesthe more people i talk to more people are open with me and i find out a lot of people are struggling with depression and mental illness trust me youre not alone we like to hide behind shadows thinking that we have perfected a reflection of happiness with in ourselves but if you open up and you let people and you will see that everybody struggling in a different way and that you are not alone but i wish that you will read this before you decide to do anything and you will consider to give life a second chance and give your parents a chance to help youmuch love i will be praying for you that you will be able to get through this hard time (from )marisol your new friend,0
your meds or find alternative medicines that might help you exercise diet meditation its hard at the beginning but these things have worked for me if you ever want to private message me im here ive gone through a lot of therapys ive done emd are i done speech therapy ive done medication ive done therapy three times a week for three hours a day ive done meditation ive exercised for 19 years i dont juice fasting diet changes herbs minerals epson salt bath mineral springs yoga hot yoga i have thought the illness with all my might and my results have been what ive expected it hasnt been easy at times and there has been times that i wanted to give up but looking back now im glad that i tried everything and that im here you will be glad to it just takes time and things will get better i promise sorry about my spelling i have dyslexia so at times i dont spell correctly i tell people what my illnesses im not afraid i was embarrassed for a very long time i tell everybody that meets me if they want to know and if im depressed ill let people know that im not feeling well so i could get what i need i learned to tell people what i need because people are not mind readers and only you know exactly what you need at the time,0
please dont do anything at this moment i had 3 suicide attempts and i survived all of them one of them i was revived one of them a tree caught me and the other one the gun didnt go off everything gets better ive seen my daughter grow up to be a excellent young lady and if my life wouldve ended earlier i wouldnt of got to experience motherhood relationships marriage i also have would not of been enjoy the wonderful moments in my life that i wouldve missed if i was not here my parents wouldve never recovered from that and they wouldve had a void in their heart for the rest of their life because nobody can live without their parents or their children so live at least one breath at a time one day at a time theres always help theres medications theres therapies theres natural remedies i could give you a whole list of things medication adjustments im not a doctor but a lot of things have worked to me i would i had inside he disorder every 30 minutes a day i finally found the right doctor they gave me the right prescription and i havent had one in seven years if you wouldve told me back then that i would not have any in in anxiety i wouldve not believed you and said leave me alone i have left a handwritten letter before the paramedics revived me the look on my moms face and being a life at that moment made me realize how much damaged i wouldve caused damn good your parents like you regardless of your debt and all the stuff the thought you put them through they will forget everything you put them through i am a parent now and there is nothing that would stop me from loving my child even if my child was a a criminal nothing you can do in this lifetime could make your parents not love you so please once again asked them for help i thought the same thing when i was in a parent that i have put my mother through enough but she never stopped helping me and she never stop believing that i could get better even when i could not believe it myselfthere is no burden for a parent you are not a burden ill be your parents theyll be more gladly that you reached out to them then you take your life there is nothing that your parents would do for you for you that would cause him any discomfort as a parent we might not react in the best way in certain situations but we are always there willing to help whatever you need we always need our children you need to see other doctors and change,0
youre describing me im on the ledge of anxious despair and suicide several times a day my anxiety twists through my chest like a knife killing me but it cant ive lived like this since i can remember my early teens but now i’m sixty i can function theyre the ghost i hide i wish my normalcy was as intense my wife and son are the candle keeping meaning in my life no matter how dark i feel i glance over to them i see through my despair theyre guiding my existence i wish peace for you i’ll never have it yet my feelings are my super power and i’ll never give them up i use no meds but meditation and long walks i wish i could feel your world through your heart,0
my sons clinic is no longer giving out benzos and brought in an addiction specialist my son occasionally takes valium but another son of mine got addicted taking 3 a day for many many years and it made his anxiety worse he got off of it through his therapist i think it is okay to use them but not for years at a time and not so many a day,1
i am taking buspar currently on 225 mg twice a day and i think it is helping- it is non addictive and i too wanted to limit my use of benzos as they are my drug of choice when i get crazy you can go up to 30 mg twice a day- i started slowly and worked up and i feel a lot less anxious worried and irritable i had to ask my doctor if i could try it- either he doesnt prescribe it often or just did not understand the anxiety component to my bipolar 1 disease,1
please talk to your doctor i am on alprazolam three times a day hydroxine at night i feel you about the benzos but my docs are telling me and assuring me that there is nothing wrong with taking them take things a day at a time and just tell your doctor what is going on try and put your trust in the doctor i know this is difficult when you have anxiety you probably feel scared to trust i know i have been there please reach out and give it a try,0
you need to talk to your dr about anxiety meds so many to choose from and so many different doses xanax klonopin ativan talk to your dr asap,1
i have bi-polar slight ocd generalized anxiety & boarder line personality if you ever need to talk call me 434-329-0685,1

please sweetheart dont give up i feel your pain i was at the end of dealing with things after a lifetime of torture my sister took her life in a very violent way her babies and i walked in after she did it after twenty years i still have awful panic attacks horrible flashbacks and an awful amount of guilt her boys have suffered horribly too even after witnessing all of that trauma i still was in so much agony that i just wanted the pain to end but you know i have fought and worked to get the right docs to help me please reach out for help i promise you that things can get better when you least expect it i had absolutely zero hope i was wishing to die it really does get better you know i too didnt want my meds to increase but sometimes like in my case that is what had to happen just until you are stable maybe please realize that you are someone special the world wouldnt be as good without you in it please you owe it to yourself and you are worth fighting for if you want to friend me on facebook i would be honored to be there for you in anyway i have very few people in my life that get it please reach out for help,0
i been through 3 suicides  and was revived and i hear stand  to tell you that you might feel like you are at the end up your rope but there is so much you are needed even if you feel like your daughters do love you they do children always need there parents they might not display it in the way you think sometimes but its proven that all children need there parents i am happy that i am still hear after being in a dark place changing your medication is an option raise your medication raising it does not mean your weak different people need higher doses it ok mental illness cause you to think no one needs you its losing to you i know this is annoying to hear but you have to fight harder then your negative thoughts you probably do that everyday and just breathing is a lot to do for someone that suffers from mental illnessreaching like you did was amendable give your self so credit theres a lot of things you can do that might ease the tension like working out taking additional herbal supplements meditating acupuncture massage juice fasting but when your juice fast you need to take your medication still epson salt baths im not a doctor but these are the things that have worked for me,1
i just know first hand the carnage the suicide of a close relative leaves behind i cant go into detail on here but the repercussions can be huge there must be another way when i was sofa bound day after day week after week i wanted to escape this life i was supposedly living but i knew that escape wasnt the answer there is always hope for a better life but it takes a huge amount of determination and resilience are you certain your girls dont love or need you? i know we can have some very strange thoughts of ourselves and loved ones when we are struggling it is so hard i know but recovery is out there try to examine whats not working and what needs to be changed reach out for help lean on those who love you dont give up x,0

speak to him honestly and openly tell him your fears regarding his lies you never know unless you try he may be going through something too but might not think youre strong enough for him to tell you? besides all of that you need to focus on getting yourself better if something he is doing is hindering that you have to talk to him and then work out where you two go from there,0
laurens grandma here i didnt know how the anxiety made you feel i am sorry you missed thr party but know your friendship with lauren is very important to her,0
aye ive learned to disassociate myself from some triggers like crowds but my guard was damaged from a nightmare otherwise id have been fine the amount of times lauren and i have saved each other goes beyond friendship shes family now and i know her and momma understood i just felt guilty because it was a promise lost,0
damn it; all typed out hit wrong area and woop gone ************************************* okay now see it read it understand it now apply it to people in your life not an excuse in any way shape or form just good information about a serious health affliction are people worth it to you? not trying to guilt anyone but we need help and yes its hard for many to ask for it a step back  reflection and interjection now application of said information is in order thanks gene one of the afflicted,0
diagnosed bipolar along with a few other things the ride is definitely scary for me and for my family we manage as best we can i am on a variety of meds and therapy,1
i have all of these its horrible,0
i wish i didnt have social anxiety even something as simple as going over for a fire and good times makes me hyperventilate and break down its so stupid,0
yes i am bipolar pills didnt work i now take a pill for pain and a pill for anxiety they make me look like an addict and people judge me but now i am able to function like a semi healthy person most days,1
this may be part of the story of my life but i have no shame in doing what it takes to be well my life is worth it and i can tell you im well! :),0
i am right there with you  antidepressant + mood stabiliser + night sedation no meds for the anxiety though have to deal with those as and when they come what i have learned over over the last 20 yrs is that the meds keep me stable and safe the therapy makes life worth living,1
lamictal its a mood stabilizer i went from a disaster to being able to find happy i dont get stress hives anymore i dont have anxiety attacks anymore i sleep pretty well considering im up throughout the night with my 3 month old no paranoia i started at 50mg went up 50mg every 2 weeks now im at 300mg and ive found life again,0
i take the pills to manage the highs lows to sleep anxiety and yet sometimes they still do not work,1
same lyn! my & kyle go skating now every tuesday because i am terrified of being around people hate it but how am i suppose to do things to exercise when they keep making me sleep? makes no sense! ,0
i use a nice sativa strain that doesnt make me paranoid or sleepy i has a nice pick me up to it and motivates me to get out and move also it is a great pain reliever,1
weru čermáková wrong strain there are many different strains some will make it seem worse others are a godsend you just need to find the strain that works for you,1
different types of bipolar could be rapid cycling but best way is to seek professional advice if youre worried about it ,0
oh this is why i feel like im dead sometimes great way to make us feel miserable lol but this is true thats why numbness is the worst feeling youll ever get when you have depression,0
yesbut its easier said than done sometimes im afraid ☹️,0
i still love angie wiltwhat ever mood strikes heryes she can a hand full and confusing at times but when i had angie she was the most beautiful perfect person that i would want to spend my life with,0
scary to be this way,0
or telling me to just slow down my breathing and breath normal and dont shake  dahhhhh i cant just make it stop just like that and it actually hurts so bad in my chest that with my first one i thought it was a heart attack  so did the er,0
im diagnosed everything and taking a lot of different meds and a few have worked and im still taking i know the struggle is real but have faith in yourself and youll find the right combination stay strong friend,1
the bit that concerns me as ive read alot about how depression meds can make manic depression/bipolar worse im terrified of getting worse as only thing worse i acting on my suicide thoughts when im manic i cant control my self ,1
you can just take it an hour at a time then its not so overwhelming ,1
i moved away from home and when i say away i am talking 22 hrs away i made excuses not to visit during holidays and i lived my life vicariously through phone and web /social media shared content until my family started to drift off i had children i had major life crisis happen and i worked with my psych team and the very few so very few friends who actually were let past the fake smiles and sarcastic cover ups of my mood swings and the fake i dont feel goods cancelations until i truly began to work through the roots of my issues and began some true self acceptance of my conditions then i became an advocate speaking out to others in need speaking up to others just coming into therapy just starting out just reaching out begging no matter how scary it gets and it will get scary please dont run away dont go backwards go forwards slowdown if you need to just dont stop and dont turn around i have been there i have turned around more than once i have stood still stuck in place and spinning circles even wanting help wishing for help and terrified of what was to come of the next step because getting that far was so painful i was the oldest of our bunch if and born in the early 80s growing up all over the usa with a mother raised in the deep south who married a pipeliner foreman with control issues from louisiana if that give any of you older guys in here an idea of the issues i had to work through it has been almost 20 years since i left home and my dad has new step dad has died my moms first husband the pipeliner died and my mom has become bed bound i still harbor some feelings i know i so as much as i feel like i worked through them i know i fell it when i see my mother and she she ask my to care for her in some way that lil kid pops up wants to scream and yell everyone can take care of himself cant they and i have to remember that she cant and i am not a kid with my own issues any more taking care of an addict,0
2 many labels on mental illness forget the stigma of a diagnoses and just work on getting better its hard work and dont be ashamed to seek helpbut be very cautious about prescriptions they can do more harm than good if dispensed from one that is not top notch in this field much over and unnecessary medicating going on,1
this is the best way i have seen this horrible disorder described ever its hard some days its harder but we pay the price always when we come back down from our highs and wish we could just crawl under a huge rock because we are so filled with guilt please dont judge be more understanding,0
i thought my daughter had bipolar for the longest but have a wonderful counselor now who had helped me see she has bpd similar  but wow really helps the caregiver realize how not to feel guilty and the aggregator,1
this is how to many people feel so horrible hugs to anyone fighting this fight,0
sometimes the hardest thing is communicating sometimes people are ready and willing to put themselves in your shoes but they cant do that unless you take them off and hand them over by that i mean sharing what you are thinking and feeling even if you are embarrassed or ashamed of it if all you do is grunt "im not feeling well" your friends and loved ones cant imagine whats going on in your head you have to share and thats difficult because anxiety wants to hide you dont want to be judged you dont want to "bother" anyone screw it: if someone close to you has made the effort to ask whats wrong make the effort to tell them honestly dont let your illness make you push people away,0
yesim going through a horrible down time that has been lasting almost a year now i feel there not a single person who truly understands what im going through even the ones who say they do underatand i feel like im drowningive been having horrible thoughts of suicide and its so hard to not think so negativelyi just dont know what to do or where to start,0
yes it is very hard i have a partner now and it has been pretty tough for us to get to a point where he can get me to trust him and for him to understand all the quirks about bpd but there are times when stressors can affect us like his favorite cat being run down by a car we are both devastated but somehow our bond is holding us together,0
i was diagnoised with bi ploal manic depression with panic disorder my life was a roller coster and my poor family road it everyday with me even if they didnt want to i was put on medication that took serveral years to find a good combo that would at least get me some level of normalcy not everday is good i still have trouble going to places alone like the grocery store etc as a single woman now it has left me to become somwhat of a hermit i dont like leaving my home except to go to work (which of course i must do) but i dont date my friends have all gone away (mainly because i push them away) i still ride the roller coster but not as often my daughter can tell a difference and for me that is why i continue to take my medication and chose to live it is difficult i will say and some days i wonder how ive made it this far but you have to want to live i do it on my terms which is not always the right way in most peoples eyes but i am as happy as any bi polar manic depressed person can be keep trying everyday for the sake of your family because they love you and need you,0
no one that lives around here i isolate so i have no friends except my family my bubble is my world i dont leave except when i see my psych doctor but then my family has to drive me since i wont drive anymore and doctor is about 30 minutes away bipolar anxiety panic ptsd disassociation are hard to deal with too there is no place in the town i live that has support group,0
im diagnosised bipolar 1 anxiety depression and ptsd in the area where i live nami has support groups every night of the week i have met people that share my diagnoses or if they dont they still understand what im going thru its been a huge help for me especially since i didnt have any support or people that understood,0
i have bp and anxiety i have depressive moments and hypomania i dont have long moments of depression it only comes in moments and the unexplained crying outbursts i wouldnt be alive without my meds i just wish there was someone at work i could talk too i feel very alone at work not part of the team ,1
i deal with bipolar depression and anxiety myself its a very hard combo to deal with but i get up everyday somedays wishing i didnt and get dressed and do my best to make it through the day if for no other reason than to prove to myself i still can,1
wow so fucking truewhy do we do this? is there treatment for it without meds? or naturally? if not can i ask what meds are prescribed? sorry for all the questionsmeds from big pharma scare me to death,1
i have had severe anxiety panic attackssevere separation anxietyptsd from childhood severe neglect emotionally physically to the point of malnutritionbipolar disorderanger outburstsi take 100 mg of seroquel20 mgs of prozacativan for emergency for anxiety and severe panictemazepam for sleepand adderrall 10 mg each daycan barely leave my homeyardand i isolate myself as much as i can for comfortits a toughunfulfilling sadscaryway to live,1
just happened last night for first time ive never been so scared in my life,0
i take gabapentin for anxiety it works well,1
i used to have episodes like yours my docs will not prescribe benzodiazapines for anxiety because they are addictive and you have to reduce your dosage gradually or you will experience withdrawal symptoms not good a couple of years ago my psych prescribed buspar (busparone) and it completely changed my life so effective for my severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive behaviors absolutely the best psych med ive ever used lots of the people in my support use it and they feel the same way i have no side effects just a little drowsiness when i first started using it i do feel a big difference if i forget a couple of doses symptoms will come back i highly highly recommend it,1
back when i was in high-school i was put on buspar for my anxiety and depression mom would bring me my meds with instant oatmeal and hot cocoa usually for breakfast to take them with before i even got out of bed it gave me such bad tummy aches that id often be doubled over in pain for a few hours after taking them i ended up having to repeat my junior year of high school because i missed on average 1 day a week of school cant pass classes when you miss 36 days first period tapering of to 27 days 6th period all in one semester (if i started feeling better id go to school late not skip the whole day) what ended up working for me was effexor (combined with the adderall i was taking for add),1
maybe i should see if i can go back on it used it before for bladder shyness,1
yes it is so scary i also have extreme anxiety among other things i am on a couple anti-anxiety meds and they help some but not all together for me when i am at that point i dont know if anything med wise would work of course i am no doctor just try and take it a day at a time sometimes that is all we can do also open up to your doctor maybe they can help,1
anxiety try breathing exercises,1
every so often i get really bad chest pain at the sternum and i become unable to take deep breaths until it goes away ive gone to the doctors a few times over the years for it and each time because i also have shoulder pain they completely ignore the respiratory issue hook me up to an ekg tell me my heart is in perfect condition and send me on my way one time they said it might be caused by heart burn and to take over the counter meds for it it helped the heart burn but not the chest pain never thought it might be connected to my anxiety or depression before hmm,1
i get chest pain with my anxiety not always but sometimes,0
i have bad anxiety i take venflaxin and amitriptyline and i very rarely get chest pains anymore,1
i have severe anxiety panic disorder and i get chest pains when my brother and i fight and i get all upset and worked up i get it im scared my anxiety may kill me im on nothing for it right now until i go doctor hell put me on valium he doesnt know about the chest painsyet its scary because i think my severe anxiety will just cause me to drop dead :(,1
me too one treated me like garbage "heres your prescription next" then i found this one and ill never look elsewhere i have really bad anxiety and he senses my fear and says "candy (thats my name) theres nothing to be afraid of here ok? i wont hurt you no one will hurt you dont be scared of me" because i can be an absolute mess,0
valium is dangerous if not monitored i would go to a new doctor and get new medication you cant live like that and dont be scared to tell him everything i did that before i was so afraid that the doctors would take my kids away but i got over that delusional thought it bothered me terribly but today i discuss every! every! think,1
have they monitored your blood pressure? whenever my blood pressure goes up chest pains is one of the symptoms i get,0
blood pressure is good,0
i am 36 years old and cut whenever anxiety is way too much for me sometimes its because of the numbness other times its because i feel way too much pain on the inside i have bipolar 1 and bpd i take a cocktail consisting of 7 different pills every day some every 4 hours for some reason cutting is like "therapy" for me,0
i struggle quite a bit with this i am bp 1 and have learned management tools over the past 27+ yrs but sometimes my demons get so horrible and if triggered the right way i lose the battle i try so hard to fight every day the other night even i got so triggered i carved words into myself to dull the pain  you arent alone i have to hide this now from my daughter and everyone! it sucks!,0
im 38 and i struggle with this also,0
i have bi polaranxiety and depression really bad its terrible to deal with on a daily basis!,1
i worry now because i say" like" people yet again see things about m/h,0
the stigma will always be there im afraid,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page i share a lot about mental illness because i want the stigma to end though i doubt it ever completely go away just like racism i have been in a mixed mode and im weary,1
most people think im just faking my bipolar to get attention or as an excuse for my "weakness" its difficult to ignore them even if i try to not care anymore i have to face them at work with family and friends (or "friends") im afraid to become sort of an hermit,0
very true and is not what we want is a dark struggle and hard battle mental illness self harmed and eating disorder we live everyday and we still alive and survive for live in this earth but mostly peoples for ignorance dont understand you and only condenm you and dont permit us talk about this for them condemn and unkind talk and comment about this some humans dont have compassion and not in our shoes for know and understand this,0
seroquel works great for my bipolar rageim also on a few other things for anxiety and depression good luck,1
yes thats very true i start therapy again june 1st so hopefully that will help im pretty calm when im not triggered im not a very violent or angry person but i just randomly snap when under pressure and i want to learn how to control myself better i appreciate the support and advice :),0
i get severe panic attacs and my depression gets worse when i dont take it,1
then let me rephrase my comment latuda works to alleviate depression symptoms in bipolar patients my bad what i was trying to stress was that there wasnt a "mood stabilizer" in this combination of medicines this person is taking now let me clarify when i say "mood stabilizers" most of these medications are actually anti-convulsant drugs im referring to them as "mood stabilizers" for simplicity purposes:-),1
i have the start also xanax and for me is a big thing because me and medication are not big friends but i have to because my anxiety is high but i go to work but i am in a rollercoaster from my emotion so,1
why not try waking up tomorrow leaving all your fear brhind walking out the door and living your life free of fear,0
i absolutely agree in theory (i live a paleo lifestyle & try to avoid medications) but for her to simply open her door walk through it & leave her fears behind is probably not do-able straight up you said it - shes been living like this for 20yrs she will need support strategies & supernatural strength to make this happen im not saying it cant happen im saying it will take time & a plan blessings ,0
we need to live free of fear  get outdoors get fresh air exercise healthy diet socialize give your life to christ clean ones mind and heart of toxicity and say no more !!!! today it ends!!! today is a new beginning free of stigmas free of worry free of anxiety  free of depression start a new adventure of love carefree living healthy relationships and jesus in control of it all !!!!,0
my son went off his xanax after many many years with the help of his therapist after all those years he had become addicted and was having more and more panic attacks from using 3 a day dont do it alone need professional help he is doing fine now so it can be done with help baby steps,1
dont go off xanax by yourself if youre in recovery you do not need marijuana i have over 18 months clean off everything including xanax i came down off the xanax in rehab it is possible to go to rehab to get off it and on soe thing else i am on busbar for anxiety latuda for bipolar depression olanzapine anti psychoticbest med ever & depacote for mood swings i am also binge eater i attend oa overeaters anonymous,0
olanzapine? is this for anxiety?,1
im on paxil after two years of actively trying to get better and trying so many different meds that either did nothing or made me worse it was such a relief to find one that worked everyone is different which is why theres so many different meds out there i havent had any bad side effects with this one unless i miss a day i do horribly mentally for a couple days up to a week if i miss a day i also take a few other meds with it because my brain worms are bastards,1
so sorry to hear of your loss joy sincerly my condonlences to you and his wife yes im mighty angry at the fact the pathetic mental health system is just crap they should be ashamed of themselfs to the max they all need to pull there fingers out and start helping instead of hindering the system is a shambles i myself have bi polar and is a struggle and a rollercoaster ride but yes more needs to be done straight away for many suffers and again joy im sorry for your loss *,0
im so sorry for your loss but happy youre speaking out to help more of us im asking for help my insurance dropped me and now i am having trouble getting my anti depressants ive been off them a week and i have gone back to where i used to be strugglingi want to sell my possessions and end the pain ive not hurt myself but ive thought of at least cutting so i draw on myself,0
ive been on it for probably 12years or so its the one medication that my doctor has never taken me off of or changed (not quite sure why) im on a pretty high dose of it i dont quite remember what side effects i had at the beginning but i do have certain side effects now i normally take it at night before going to bed if i happen to drink or eat anything after taking more often than not i get a feeling come over me like im drunk my doctor could never explain if thats a true side effect but its been happening to me the whole time i take it as well as if i miss a dose that following day my body is extremely shaky (even feels like my body is shaking from the inside) and i cant seem to focus correctly until i take it again,0
the meds scare me worse then the mood swing and my own thoughts,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar 15 years ago at that time i had become very poorly and tried to kill myself luckily my doctor has been fantastic and spent alot of time getting my meds right i refused to be admitted to mental health hospital went every week to a special clinic with other outpatients my doctor didnt think i would ever hold down a full time job but i can say with much pride that i managed to hold down my job for the last 13 years look after my family and now my grandchildren one of which i have special guardian ship of every day is a struggle but i have been blessed with a wonderful family and some really lovely friends when i feel an episode coming on i go straight to my doctor if it is bad but i have come to recognise triggers and my husband children and parents also can tell when something is wrong i wont let the big black nothing get me so poorly again please if you think there is something wrong dont be scared or embarrassed it isnt a bad thing to need help be happy it is your right!!!! ,0
thank you for posting this! how does a brain know when its sick? if people just mock them or avoid them it stays the same be patient but persistent on how to deal with triggers it is very difficult dealing with others problems but if you love them its worth it when taking meds make sure the person has shown improvement of some kind sometimes theres more than 1 med for a disorder make sure you eat foods that are high in seretonin norepinephrine & etcbecause the meds dont produce more of it they just keep the ones your body produces from escaping their path & dying with these disorders your brain doesnt produce enough of them which causes the disorder just try it & see if you notice a difference just google seretonin etc & find what foods you like nutrition is very important for the disorder and not many drs and counselors explain this completely where people understand it write down everything so if you forget then its still right there or have someone you trust go with you to get the info in case you missed something also exercise as much as you can and whatever you can do cause the euphoria also helps a lot if anyone out there didnt know this please please try this & see if it helps or help someone you know with the disorder having worked with kids that have brain disorders it is so gratifying when you see them improving keep positive for the one with the disorder because they cant until theyre stable ‍ ‍ ‍ ☺️ ,1
i have depression and anxiety and i have most of these symptoms ,1
i havent gotten diagnosed with bpd but ive been diagnosed with major chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorderbut the older i get the more ive started to notice i have symptoms of bpd and some of my friends who do have bpd believe that i do im terrified to go back to a doctor because people already look at me weird for my depression and anxiety i dont know what to doand i feel as if its getting worse,1
im in liverpool its taken me 15 years for me for anyone to take me seriously i have been constantly mis diagnosed by my gp since 2005 i have been told over and over again i was suffering with post natal depression as i a mother of 6 i knew dam well it wasnt anyway one day i broke down infront of a new gp and begged for help i got a feferal to broad oak mental health hospital i had an assessment there and they knew straight away i had borderline and possible bipolar i thought oh great i will at least be treated now how wrong was i!! i was then told i will have to see a clinic psychologist who could prescribe me mood stabilizers and anti psychotics which i desperately need and that was over 6 weeks ago and i still have had no appointment through to see anyone i was also promised an intensive course of cbt and /or dbt and again  ive heard nothing i have rang every week telling them im desperate and i need my meds now and they just say wait for your appointments to come through its a complete joke!!!! god forbid what could happen in the mean time its virtually impossible to get help in the uk,0
hell no! im in australia the uks treatment of the clinically insane scares me,0
i have depression and anxiety very bad have been on 7 meds none worked from my primary dr shoul i see a psychiatrist to get better idea of what i need,1
bpd is short for borderline personality disorder and should not be confused with bipolar disorder,1
effexor extended release at 150m is what i am on and i have been on this for almost 10 years now i aint going to lie it is horrible if you go cold turkey off of it if you wheen yourself off not so bad now every day feeling its made me maintain at an even keel but from what i am reading from everyone responding is that its totally individual and i would try it and if you feel like its not making things even for you then wheen yourself off slowly,0
im on 150mg and its the only drug ive been on thst works for me withdrawals are horrible if you miss dosages though,0
horrible night sweats!!! the withdrawal is absolutely horrible never again!!!!,0
im on it for anxiety and depression she is hoping it helps stabilize my moods bc im bipolar as well i took it for the first time last night idk if it was just my anxiety about taking it but my chest hurt and i didnt sleep good at all! all these side effects scare me bc i have two young children an 18 month old and a 2 month old i dont wanna be irritable or saddened even more i have to take care of my babies what if i dont notice myself change? im doing it alone so i dont have anyone to tell me if im being extra cranky or if im snapping i dont wanna snap on my kids or go through withdrawals,1
i was on it and it was horrible i was like a zombie and the depression was horrendous i slept for 6 months coming off it was frightening i was so sick with shakes and aches and nausea plus hallucinationsvery scary,1
effexor worked for a while then it lost its edge so ended up on valium with it as well for short time but now i just end up taking a 150 in the morning and a 150 in the afternoon it helps me get through the day  but only just ive anger general anxiety disorder and depression been on various meds now for nearly 10 years  since i got diagnosed with cancer  cancers gone but the mental issues that came with it still remain,1
messed my blood pressure up bad passed out more than once,1
i thought it made me irritable stopped and went back to prozac but that was a long time ago i was only 14,0
first off ive ptsd and dont know your infliction its a horribly addictive drug ever have brain shocks? objectively it did take my sadness and anger away but it left me with nothing i missed my feelings no matter how awful i felt like a zombie and i locked myself in a room for 4 years i would not prescribe it but im sure it has benefits its dangerous and addictive know that before hand it could lead to suicidal thoughts of hopelessness be wary of any pharmaceuticalthere is no magic fix doesnt exist,0
horribleawful withdrawal if you have to go off of it,0
took it for anxiety before i knew i was bipolarwent hypomanic for the first time at age 40 now i need mood stabilzier and antidepressant ( bipolar type 2),1
high anxiety and panic attacks suicidal also,1
whats your dose? im struggling on 150mg think i need more gp is reluctant to put me up or try something new,0
effexor works better for me than celexa lexapro wellbutrin and prestique i had absolutely no weight gain and no other side effects  works well for me only issue ive had has been the fact that if i miss a dose i feel crappy and uneasy until i take always keep a day or two of meds with me no matter where i am going just in case i get somewhere and realize i forgot a dose,1
im on 75mg of it currently and i feel like it doesnt really do much of anything but make me more depressed not to mention that ive only ever missed one day of it at it was absolutely horrible i wanted to die,0
get the brain shocks when in detox? me too horrible drug does help with depression but leaves you feeling numb thats a prison i never want to return too,0
it was awful !! especially when i came off i went through horrible withdrawal,0
night terrors high blood pressure fits of ragenot the right one for me i went back to celexa and all is well,0
i like it i take it in conjunction with other medications i do however opt for the tablets versus the extended release i can miss a round of my meds and not be too off my game but will be slightly grumpy/more anxious like others have said you have to find what works for your body trial and error is a sometimes long process but having a supportive understanding dr is the best thing for you when trying to find the right meds,1
i did not have a good expirience on itit made me horribly suicidalthen when i was getting off of it the withdrawals are like compared to getting off of heroin one of the worse anti depressants to come off of i missed 3 months of work feeling like i had the flu every single day it was awful,0
is it anxiety attacks? bc thats what i was told when i was having them,1
ive been to the er because i had chest pains mine was also stress related now that im on medication ive no longer had those symptoms,0
i do the same thing when my anxiety is high or i dont get enough sleep,1
that used to happen to me alot then it stopped dont know whytalk to a dr about it maybe it has something to do with anxiety,1
one of my sons does this especially when he sleeps for him it is anxiety he had a sleep trial done to rule out apnea,1
yes i think mine is anxiety but i blame everything on that,1
are you having any other symptoms it could be anxiety,1
been there myself and i know what its like here is the suicide prevention lifelines number 1 (800) 273-8255 they are licensed counselors are are there to help not judge you can also seek help from a mental health professional you should never be ashamed for seeking help; its not a weakness,1
the struggle is real i k ow all too well,0
everyday struggle ,0
totally relate to this people will never know the constant struggle :(,0
you will come to understand your illness ( same as mine ) as you go through therapy i thought a lot of things i wasdoing and feeling were normal if there is such a thing found out in therapy that they were part of the disease ! took a bit to find the best meds but now i have way less anxiety and terrible depression and my ocd has really proved your therapist is your best advocate,1
maybe so kayla ive had this al my life and im not going to lie it is a struggle but with the correct medicine ? you can lead a semi normal life one day at a time and the power of positive thinking please keep your chin up ,0
jane ashley sorry i am from belgium and every day i cry because i can not accept it i can not believe it i whas so in chock when the doc told me because i dont feel over happy or verry low i what i feel is anxiety so i dont understand this,0
nadine believe me i know its a shock to hear from a doctor that one is bi polar yes it was for me as well i was told this when i was 18years old im now a young 51 but you got to accept the fact otherwise you will be in the same place honestly i as well as millions of other people with bi polar had to face this at one stage or another i know its hard but when you learn to accept you can move on with your life honestlyi not only have bi polar i have stress anxiety a bit of ocd and virtiligo but hey life can throw all sorts at us sweetheart but its up to us to face it head on and say ok this is how im going to look at this and apply myself please have faith and believe and know you are not the only one on this rollercoaster as i see it wow have i had many rides think positive nadine be strong ,0
i wish it were a choicel mean who would willingly choose a dark black holel am often challenged that l have this so called-choice and guilt is then heaped on me,0

hi kristy i just took a look at your profile page is that your beautiful baby girl in that picture? she is precious i know you may feel like you dont matter to anyone right now but i bet you mean the world to her i see youre engaged thats something great to look forward to i have kids myself and ive felt like ending it all on many occasions ive actually tried a couple of times i know youre in a very dark place right now please try to remember these feelings will pass you have people close to you who love you very much and would be devastated if you were taken away from them thinking about my kids has kept me from hurting myself many times i know when youre in that state of mind its hard to realize anyone really cares but they do you have to try to remember that here i am a complete stranger and im very worried about you you are a beautiful young woman with a lot to offer this world i know you are also strong to have survived depression as long as you have and you werent afraid to reach out to total strangers for help is your fiance understanding of your depression? i know its hard in relationships sometimes but he may be someone you can turn to if youre just looking for others to talk to who understand how you feel then im sure there are many on this forum who would love to talk to you anytime youre welcome to message me anytime just to talk just please think of those who love you and would be very sad if you werent here anymore if the feeling is too bad for you please call the suicide hotline or go to the er if you feel like talking make another post or message me or someone else just please dont hurt yourself i promise you these horrible feelings will pass i know you know that deep inside please hang in there,0
call a suicide hotline and talk to all of us i know life can be rough and overwhelming sometimes dont give up,0
the biggest thing that i know to avoid for us is any of the artificial sweeteners they break down into some nasty chemicals that do not react well with our brains i have been struggling with my appetite so it has been very hard to me to be interested in eating at all but i do so much better on a well balanced diet especially if i can grab a quick snack of veggies or fruit through out the day but like i said i have no appetite so finding anything to get me to eat is hard and that makes the symptoms roar,0
i would suggest having some blood work done and make sure you arent deficient in any vitamins or minerals many times people with bipolar or depression are deficient in vitamin d and other things so you might want to add that to you diet or take a supplement i think ( and please dont think i have any science to back me up on this) that things vary from person to person but based on what i see with meds that some meds work for some people and others work for others i am going to guess that is the way it is with diets too what will work for you might not be what works for others i mean there are some definite things all bipolars should avoid like alcohol and non-prescribed drugs and maybe dont over indulge in caffeine i try to stay under two cups a day but some days i go over that because i love coffee so much other than that i try to eat food that makes me feel good some days it is stuff that actually makes me feel healthy some days it is stuff that makes me feel like i want to live it depends on what sort of day i am having fresh fruits and veges are good for everyone lean meats are good for everyone lots of water is good for everyone staying away from junk food and sweets is good for everyone a nice walk is good for everyone,0
no secrets here eat healthy food avoid alcohol caffeine and tobacco,0
this is the best advice i have gotten in a long time thank you nicole!!! things r lil better today still feeling a bit overwhelmed but i know i can get thro this i need to find meds that actually work maybe a better doctor,1
with my husband he said that he doesnt know how to talk to me anymore weve been together for 9 years ive been dealing with this for almost 20 years he said he doesnt know if he can talk to me normally or if he has to treat me like a baby because hes afraid of saying the wrong things and upsetting me,0
ha ha if i stopped my meds that would be the time for them to start worrying,1
melissa thorn i had terror,0
i had a supervisor who i had trusted and i confided in apparently she notated my file the next supervisor i had became very agitated and afraid of me after she read my file when i asked what was the matter she refused to answer me so i went to her boss and found out the reason she then refused to meet with me alone in the same room i was not allowed to read my file either i went to human resources after that and requested a new supervisor which was turned down i was working in a call center where there was constant noise change interruption you name it all things that are really bad for someone with bp i ended up in the hospital several times and eventually went on short term then long term disability after that experience i am very careful who i confide in but you betcha i stick up for us when people have blown out ideas about bp,0
well my experience when i try explainin my bp is well im exactly like thati think what the fuck!!!!???? its so frustratinits not a clubits a horrible thing to deal with!!! but at least were talkin about it and hopefully people might actually care/help ,0
i like that look of terror in their eyes let the manipulation begin,0
i on the other hand enjoy sparking terror into the eyes of ignorant normies :d,0
i know this feeling all too well but you have to learn to laugh one time at work years ago ill never forgetthis chic just out in the open office "i cant stand bipolar people they scare me they should all be locked up medicated or not",0
its true most bipolar and anxiety patients suffer with yoyo sex drive bt this is due to meds according to research i did sex is almost non exsistent so it takes u and yr partner to work together to make it work so dont just say its not der  make plans hv date nights snuggle take showers and baths together help him and make sure he gets back on his meds gv it tym your will settle into a routine from there the skies the limit god bless,1
you say he`s not medicate is he in counseling/therapy? have you attended such with him? if not that might be an option or maybe find a group to try? certain meds did that to me thank god my dr decided that class of drugs doesn`t help me also have you tried positive stress relief? basically any safe legal activity that makes him smile laugh or feel accomplished have you ruled out medical problems? i don`t like to admit it but some of us need medicated the right meds schedule is a better for me than fighting it all the time to just scrape by,1
the only time i feel like sex is when im manic otherwise i have no sex drive the depression and anxiety destroy it although you try to make it happen it just doesnt it doesnt mean he doesnt love you or not find you attractive its the illness it must be difficult for you it will be for him too but in a different way hope his health improves soon x,0
proformance anxiety amay be the problem there can be anxiety along with bipolar and when they need to perform in many different areas the anxiety goes sky high and they just cant no matter how much they may want too nothing to do with love,1
my boyfriend is ptsd bi-polar or possibly bpd he wants to have sex sometimes as do i but we dont and have not for almost a year the reason is he is so mean and says such awful things or most every comment or reminder i make he takes as a personal assault this makes me withdrawal and afraid of him makes it very difficult to be intimate i love and care for him so very much but the hurt and anger he exudes is an instant and on going turn off it is hard to be open and vulnerable with someone who now blames you for all of his issues i try so hard,0
when i am in a depressive cycle (most of the time) i struggle with my sex drive when not medicated as well - then i have zero sex drive a red flag that im in trouble is when i cant get enough sex its guaranteed that im heading into a hypomanic cycle then,0
firstlyno-one will take yr children from you honey so cross that worry off yr list sounds like depression or maybe bipolar please see yr gp & dont ever be scared to tell someone how yr feeling!!! hope this helps & much luv 2 you! yr not alone in this! ,1
they definitely will not take your kids if u r seeking help! but it does sound like anxiety and some type of mood disorder catch it now cause it can get worse! get with a dr asap! your whole life will change once they get you seen about,1
you are obviously concerned so my suggestion is to see your dr i would also suggest keeping a mood journal listing dates and times of mood changes and how you feel at that time you can then take this journal to your dr and it can be a very effective diagnostic tool you dont always remember everything when you go to see a dr about mental health because of anxiety or poor memory in general,1
definitely seek help from somewhere its sounds like bipolar ii with anxiety,1
sounds like u have a mood disorder of some sorts and anxiety issues bit that can only be diagnosed by a professional so my advice would be to see a psychiatrist no they r not gonna take ur kids away because u suffer from depression and anxiety! that just doesnt happen so dont worry about that seek help from ur local county social services or psychiatric clinic good luck always rememver the setting sun is a promise for tomorrow ,1
hi nemo i struggle with my weight through medication also i know you say that diet and exercise dont seem to work but they should just slowly the best advice i can offer is to increase protein fruit (grapefruit is a natural fat burner)  vegetables (iron rich leafy greens) swap simple carbohydrates for complex ones saturated (trans fats) for unsaturated fats (rapeseed oil has the lowest content of saturated fat and also helps reduce cholesterol) green teas acai berry supplement raspberry key tones supplements probiotics to aid your digestive system switch to dark chocolate (but dont eat it before bed or your body will store it as fat a small eaten in the morning has proven benefits) and most importantly drink as much water throughout the day as you can (i fill a jug and put sliced limes lemons and ginger root in then stick it in the fridge its really tasty and good for you) hope this helps! ~vw~,1
it has different effects for different people dont let some image scare you although abilify did not work for me so i had to switch meds,1
the only thing it gave me was major panic attacks i would hyperventilate  sweat vomit shake get dizzy,0
truvision works belinda piketru try ths stuff message this girl the stuff is amazing i dont really have to worry about anti depressant as much !,1
i took it and ended up with a nonstop twitching and tingling in my legs it was horrible my doctor told me to stop immediately and now i take restless leg medicine when needed never had that issue prior to this medicine my mom took it and had no issues-worked great for her we all respond differently,1
when it first started i remember having to stand at my desk at work and just stomp my feet it was such a miserable feeling,1
dont worry i went through the same thing your not the only one it always used to happen after i had dinner of a night,0
i was on it for a few months and noticed i started struggling to focus on simple tasks at work i felt like i could conquer the world but not plan how to do it i stopped and i began to be able to think clearly again i refuse to take it again no matter what,0
i suffered lots of side effects none listed here but were dangerous and scary,1
ive been there done that he put me on the wrong dosage and i was so dizzy and lightheaded etc i couldnt sleep or stay up so i shaked back and forth in bed till it wore off felt like i was going to die so i never toke it again dont get me started on other sexual side effects it caused good times :p ,0
of course lots of people have very negative reactions to aripiprazole i was one of them abilify and celexa were the first two antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications i was prescribed when i was diagnosed ten years ago together they made me gain 40 pounds increased my agitation and made me suicidal ive since taken several genetic tests and determined my resistance to the drugs is primarily genetic and biochemical i cant handle ssris and many antipsychotics i have friends and family members who have successfully managed their depression with the same drugs that were terrible for me dozens of medications later i am still trying to find the right combination for me i know many people who have seen life-changing results for the better after taking these medications under strict clinical guidance the most important thing is to see a professional on a consistent basis to monitor your medications or better yet several well-trained and credible psychiatrists and psychotherapists who have extensive experience and knowledge of the effects of these drugs so they can prescribe them with caution make sure your doctors are up-to-date with the most recent pharmaceutical research and clinical trials psychiatric research is always evolving and drugs are constantly being tested as new information becomes available about their effects,1
horrible medication!!!! akathisia!,1
this stuff gave me seizures and i had no control over my eye movements scary stuff,0
i was on aripiprazole (abilify) for a considerable length of time i credit my psych and this drug for allowing me to become the person i am today it essentially saved my life! i find the fact that people who experienced side effects may be eligible for compensation disconcerting am i eligible for compensation based on the side effects i encountered whilst on other medication before i found what worked for me? i very much doubt it these side effects are listed in the data sheet and crucially what works for some may not suit others,1
same here and im literally still shaking my legs my mom used to put her hand on my knee to help me stop but i couldnt all my boyfriends notice it when ee are in bed i attempted suicide on it as well due to ither circumstances at yhe time also but i actually went through with b yhe attempt still have the scar my impulse control was null and void and i was agitated all the time school was next to impossible to deal with and im still lost as ever,0
dude i ran across the interstate during rush hour i took off to connecticut with a boy i had just met i think back to how many times i ran away and got into the car with strangers and all the risky fucked up shit i didlike how the fuck did i not die? and you know when i got better? when i stopped taking that shit after being on it for 4 years,1
i had gambling problems i was always buying scratchers but i had really bad muscle tremors my left arm shook constantly and it was starting to effect my right arm it too was getting to the point of being more so then not and as an artist losing the ability to draw and write is my biggest fear and that medicine was getting in the way if that so i just quite taking everything and only smoked weed now im the happiest ive ever been in life,0
i hate these scare tactics,0
yep i had all but uncontrollable muscle movement it really messed up my life and ive been trying to rebuild whats left of it my old psych pushed so hard for me to be on it,0
thanks everyone for your input i found out it was the start of a panic attack (weird because they dont usually start that way for me) i took clonazepam and it relaxed me and my breathing went back to normal,1
i get a heavy chest when anxiety and panic start,1
it says " im a queen " with a semicolon because ive battled for so long with depression anxiety disorder etc " im a queen" because queens are strong independent and amazing but they still can ask for help when needed,1
having many symptoms again things have gotten very stressful and ive already blown up several times this week,0
im always hungry but too nauseous to eat always tired but cant sleep scared to be alone but people in general are too stressful to be around i wish it would just freaking stop,0
brenda speth balleza yeah cant tell you how many relationships it has strained because i dont know my anger is going nuclear unless someone points it out to me its actually the only warning i get that im starting an anxiety attack :(,0
acute vs chronici will never take xanex again tho we are all different and there are many mixes that work praying you find yours the struggle is real!!,1
it is a struggle but please remember your not alone  my son described it to his mates like i wake up tigger or eeyore ever need to talk pm me,0
im struggling today thank you for this,0
its only a sufferer u knows wat it feels lyk bt wen non sufferers say wat getting hyper for wat u worrying? thats wen i lyk to take my sandals and hit them,0
i need to share this to my family they dont understand depression and anxiety,1
all i know if it wasnt for the lord i would have gassed my self but he stepped in and took control of my fears and paranoia which was very bad at that time i also has a character that i created for my self when i was in mania her name was because she is also laid to rest now in any case i called her the white princess of africa it had to do with my faith he set me free from what person i created,1
theres never a testimony without a test god will turn your mess into a message a setback is a setup for a comeback you must not turn your back on god lots of people wonder why they are stuck in certain situations but god really does mend your brokenness no matter how bad the situation gets you ought to praise god no matter what you have to believe that the works of the enemy will be exposed and destroyed focus on the good in your life pray do your best and dont worry about the rest,0
im not sure how people survive i just got laid off from work so im really struggling right now to much time in my head and i its not good maybye some social programs can help you with legal help,0

oh myno coddling goin onfckn social media can bring out the "harshness" in people being kind & gentle is not molly coddling! some of us are just more gentle than others just remembersometimes "harsh suck it up" comments can be enough to push a vulnerable person over the edge!!! please think a little before you post! what doesnt affect you could be devastating to someone else!!!!! ,0
i agree lori i personally found that remark uncalled for and a bit upsetting people really aught to choose their words a bit more wisely on social media particularly on a page such as this,0
i think when people are too mentally ill to function or even get out of bed the statement of "put your big girl panties on can be a very damaging statement yes we are all sick here yes its all different degrees weve been told our whole lives to quote "suck it up" and it its a very deep cord for some of us and can seem extremely insensitive always be aware that you never know what other peoples struggles are,0
anyone thats gona patronise someone with struggles should keep their stuff to themselveswe all have different struggles united we should stand!!!,0
awwwecome on guysgo easy on each other pleeeease people do not post on here to be berated by others & told to get on with iti too am currently not working because of it & its a damn struggle maybe sending love & good wishes to each other is what suffers need lots of love 2 you felicia ,0
well im so glad u found it that easy and u done that i am not one of those people unfortunately there is no way i can work a job at this moment in time and i havent for a number of years that doesnt mean im not a big girl i also am a mother to 6 children i feel a failure as a mother every day of my life because my illness impacts so hugely on family life i still cannot get up and go to work despite having my kids its a struggle for me to just get up to feed them some days i have bipolar borderline personality disorder chronic anxiety and ptsd  its a living hell,0
i understand felicia im a single mom n with enough physical n emotional conditions to need n want to stop working dailybut i have to feed my daughter n keep a roof over her head every day is a constant struggle but luckily im still going,0
i filed for disability last july denied in nov and filed my judge appeal in dec still waiting :( luckily my bf has barely been keeping us going its extremely difficult ive even tried to go back to work because i was frustrated and ended up having a severe panic attack and flipping out before my first day just cant do it anymore id do anything to have the old me back :(,0
i personally had a horrible reaction to latuda doctor stopped it immediately and started me on seroquel xr,1
i have disabling bipolar ii and these comments really show how differently medications work for different people they tried to give me latuda for my attituda and i had a horrible reaction i wandered from room to room not knowing what to do unable to think logically the only thoughts that were going through my head was if this is life i dont want to live it im very very resistant to try new medications because of latuda theyre trying to talk me into lemactil now,0
my son has depressed but he didnt want to tske meds he was on something but its hard to try and make s 20 old tske his meds very stressful for me at times cause i didt no how to help him i am on zofol hes doesnt want to tsk gl no one so were do i turn for help for him,1
i am bipolar 2 an also a spring depressive when i say depression everyone says "oh it must be so hard all winter i just hate it tough to spend every winter so down you must have s a d me: not at all i love winter! they never understand i always feel best in october get jobs in november and lose them by may that was before meds but i still struggle every march-april to prevent a full episode,0
i cant remember what i was on but i was having nightmares of my pawpaw and i was waking up around 2 or 3 in the morning staying up til bout 8 or so in the morning then go to sleep my doctor had to change it and then i switched doctors and i got put on celexa for my anxiety and depression,1
suicide ideation and intrusive thoughts which is what you are describing are not a reason to be committed to hospital but you should explain them to your therapist as they can be extremely unsettling especially when they are so vivid or wont go away which is very distressing and not under your control they are a symptom of how you are feeling and im sure talking about them will give you some relief,0
anxiety can cause intrusive thoughts things you would never actually do or that dont make sense they are vivid and can be very scary but they are the result of the chemicals in your brain working differently your therapist should be someone you trust if you cant trust him or her then find a new one good luck!,1
exactly what is happening to me most nights but i literally keep it to myself cause i believe anything i say can be twisted to my therapist they try to heal what they sometimes cant understand unless they go thru it they have papers that say they are professionals in curing or help cope what we go thru but personally some things are meant to be unsaid if u personally feel like this isnt something that is going to occur in life right it in a journal is alot safer and less stress worrying if what u say can backlash at udont take my statement as advice its just something that i do to protect myself from being taken for certain words i say in front of someone that has the power to say im incapable of going home,0
some meds give me weird vivid dreams but dont worry dreams dont count,1
pretty sure they can only do that if you admit you want or plan to harm yourself if you explain to your therapist your dreams just how you did here im sure it will be ok i cant imagine how stressful and unsettling those dreams must be it would be good to talk to her about it,0
its like people dont even read its more of the lying to her clearly saying he wants to but lying about it and the fact that their relationship has changed and hes clearly not invested in it i have no advice i live by the rule of do i spend more days happy than sad if not whats the point for me it got to the point i wanted to kill myself i felt so horrible theres something to be said for having stabilityespecially for kids but if yall are miserable and not connected they pick up on that a conversation needs to happen clearly though focus on facts not feelings,0
i have the same problem its hard i had an episode in feb where i didnt sleep for 11 days i was not medicated bc i lost days in my mind i ended up being so paranoid that i went crazy on my loved ones had a break between fantasy and reality i went off on his mom and my entire family  now he seems embarrassed to b w me she wont forgive me and everyone thinks we should break upi have multiple diagnosis but he has a hard time understanding them we have been together 8 yrs he drank a lot but now is sober i want to marry him but im not sure im ready to explain my illness to everyone who already have me labeled as crazy  i have said sorry and that it wont happen again i knoe my triggers and symptoms and have a lot of support and have help to get through the bad days  dont know if its to broken or worth saving  life is hard enough and i cant beg anymore for forgiveness,0
i understand about getting married especially since youve been engaged that long its like why propose in the first place if he didnt plan on marrying you? if he cant do that then its a show of not being able to commit and now that hes changed? idk i would sit down and have a long talk with him about his intentions and where he wants to be with you and why he doesnt wanna get married communication is everything dont let the anxiety talk for you either write down the points you wanna talk about while in a clear mind,0
if he treats you and the kids good then dont worry about getting married its how he supports you and the kids that is most important,0
yep! its worse when im stressed out :/,0
i use cannabis it really helps me no pain no depression no anxiety no bad side effects,1
firstly why did you stop? you also dont say what meds you were taking its not a good idea to just suddenly stop some meds have dreadful withdrawal symptoms and you really should gradual dose reduction over a few weeks,1
i agree i write letters and i keep a diary due to some days i cant remember what i was upset and angry for bless you sweetie xx,0
thank you thats one of my biggest struggles im like this but not depressed :/,0
its so so hard it is also hard to advise or even suggest what worked for others as your individual case is just that i just know that when you are feeling as bad as you obviously are and cant see the wood for the trees it is so difficult to know what to do for the best for my recovery the first major step was acceptance and i suspect you are at that stage where you are fully aware of your illness and are not pretending to yourself or others the next step is taking responsibility for yourself and your recovery which you are now trying to do these are major steps which you should feel proud of and are far from easy to embrace and admit many live with mental illness in relative secrecy so if you do have people who care and you care about it must help but it must be so tough for those around you but im sure they will do all they can however hard it is at the end of the day you all want the same thing to get you well i felt i wanted to escape i think thats quite common not not to be here but to escape from the torment and pain to escape that torment the answer is to get better there is hope which you must hold on to i had months day after day on the sofa today i can enjoy the tiny things there is hope unfortunately it isnt easy to recover its a long hard road but ultimately i think we all have the strength i had to do it alone no one knew or if they did they didnt care enough i was adamant i wouldnt take anti depressants see a counsellor or take sleeping tablets i was frightened and not in control in the end i took the lot recovery from mental depression is often a huge mixture of small steps whatever works best for you if you have loved ones lean on them let them help its down to small steps achievable goals when you are ready try to come up with a plan small but significant steps to move forward and get you better try to pinpoint what isnt working what you need to change take each day as it comes be kind to yourself people need you and love you you can do this for them but mainly for you there is light there is colour there is hope xxx,0
i am against meds but it will be the best for you to be reevaluated by a different psychiatrist with a new approach give the "quick release" meds a week or two (you will be sleepy and relaxed) and if you dont feel better i would try a short term hospital stay preferably private room (noise and lots of people might escalate your anxiety) long term meds will kick in in 7 weeks and by then you should feel almost human cognitive therapy is of utmost importance psychiatrist usually work hand and hand with a psychologist 6 months and your a for a way ***i find the holistic approach favorable takes much longer but it works research: scio health4life natural healers associations good luck your not alone you will get better believe in yourself hope love faith,1
it sounds like you are very blessed to have a husband and friend that care so much worry about you right nowget the helpyou will be happy you did in long run wish you the best!,0
im so sorry your going through all of this your hubby and bf love you and only want the best for you they dont want you to hurt any more you need to go and hopefully you wont feel quite so bad just remember you are loved by your family your bf and by all of us❤ just hang in there and get the help you so desperately need please ❤,0
it hurts but usually if its a good hospital it helps a lot if you cut yourself you going husband can take care of horse for a few days if i didnt have 200 things to do i think id admit myself ups and downs hate living but my family is everything depressed severely or manic and confused,0
it is possible but if thats not your diagnosis then dont get extra worried about it let the doctor do his job about diagnosis and you work on getting better take your meds and go to therapy if your meds arent working right get an appointment for a change,1
side effect i experienced most was shakiness and severe tremors once dose was lowered it went away otherwise it works well no suicidal thoughts,1
worst ones for me are the shaking and the nausea,1
my son was on it for years with good results screwed up his thyroid and much later on gave him horrible acne almost boils on his back after years it quit working then there is the blood tests but i would say it is worth a shot in taking some people know right away if they cant take it because of the blood work,1
i liked lithium but it gave me nightmares/night terrors,0
i couldnt keep it down i would take it and then 5-10 minutes later vomit it was miserable,1
make sure to have blood levels checked if you take lithium mine wasnt being monitored and overdosed for 3months with alot of uncontrollable vomiting,1
lithium worked great for me until i found out i was pregnant after i was done breastfeeding i got back on and it was horrible for me severe insomnia hallucinations couldnt drive vision changes,1
i was lithium for almost 10yrs & i never had a problem  but every person is different on kilodopin for anxiety & albilify for paranoia good luck,1
paranoia and anxiety both were largely increased on lithium suidical thoughts for me were daily too lithium and depakote were terrribleeeeeee for my mental and physical health but everyone is different ive heard more bad then good about lithium though,1
be careful im no doctor but that sounds like a very scary mix! i wish u the best,1
i really struggled with this for years i didnt take vacation because i didnt think single people did that my psychiatrist convinced me to go on a regular cruise and that really opened up my perspective i can have fun by myself because i push myself to meet at least one new person wherever i went just one person was not overwhelming when i got home i applied the same principal i meet one new person at the grocery store aisle in the checkout line at the park at church or the movies its really surprising how friendly and reassuring that one person can be,0
idk struggle with this myself,0
hello colinim 56 ive had mental health probs all my lifei hated bein single n alone but i leanrt to love bein alone music is a great way of distressing watchin comedys is also greatit really boils down to being happy in ur own skinonce uve mastered that n enjoy ur life it will attract peeps to ukeep strong xox,0
ativan is a dangerous medication if you are prone to addiction at all or not it is very addicting i had a horrible time withdrawing from it after attempts to end the pain it builds up in the fat cells in the body and requires more and more to feel better medication can help many but benzodiazepines are not a good choice some may be able to comply and not take more than prescribed but it is still damaging i am not a doctor but one who has a lot of experience from the last 15 years as you can see i feel very strongly about ativan i wish the best for all of you hurting it can get better please continue to fight it,1
but for many it does work if any medication is causing an issue you have to address that with your psych doctor and yes i know its hard sometimes i have bipolar 1 anxiety ptsd and personality disorder bipolar since childhood,1
i too am a survivor of suicide attempts 2 in fact what gets me is whenever there is some "celebrity" that actually succumbs to the thoughts that many of us have known it gets horribly blown up in the media for those of us who have survived every time this happens there is a range of emotions that you experience you can talk to your therapist but somehow it just isnt enough what i am trying to do is start a suicide attempt survivor group that would be led either by a therapist or social worker i am trying to work out the details with the agency where i have my social worker both my therapist and my social worker thought it was a great idea there are groups for families who have lost a loved one but not for us i think it is time for one,0
psychiatric meds do cause more harm than good i was on some and it caused sleepiness disorientation slurred speech nasty taste in mouth sporadic behavior uncontrollable communication or actions depending on p,1
its very important especially wth bi-polar with panic attacks/anxiety and depression that you take your medication that works right for you do never throw yr meds away and stop you will eventually go worse till its very serious situation stay well and take your medication without fail,1
i am saddened by his passing but hope it will help some have conversations with loved ones friends and their doctors about their medications risks and treatment plans,1
i think unfortunately we live in an age where its easier and more common to ask for advice on a social media page rather than get correct information from a professional health care worker i see so many people asking for help or advice on medications on facebook and i cant help but to think "why dont you just ask a psychiatrist" sadly i think this is due to the fact that many people all across the world do not have easy or affordable access to mental health professionals australia nz usa and many more countries i have lived in have very poor support for people with mental health issues my advice is this always check with a doctor before changing dosage or stopping any medication i know that many medications can cause increased risk of depression anxiety or suicidal thoughts but there are also many that dont it takes time to find the right medication sometimes and it can be a tedious process i also am a suicide survivor and speaking for myself i wouldnt be here without my medications keep fighting the good fight people !,1
yes you could very well call the members of this site a community because we all have something in common would you be offended if you were a red sox fan and the announcer referred to you as being part of red sox nation? i highly doubt it,0
are you being medication compliant? do you have a rescue plan for anxiety attacks?,1
my goal is to one day not need so much medicine my doctor has told me she has no other meds ive tried them all i dont trust all in meds ive decided when i get the time to go back to yoga i obviously have anxiety from all the years of abuse from child good until an early adult,1
yeah i usually am good about taking my meds the pharmacy took forever to fill my depression meds because they had to get a pre authorization if im not taking them i become maniac and high on life my counselor knows when this occurs lets see when i have anxiety attacks usually i take my pill or i breathe or i shake until it goes away by talking myself out of it,1
this is something i post alot about because it helps me alot is medical marijuana if you do the right research and really look into it it could really help you like most medicine you do need to be careful when first trying it as it is not for everyone i have an overwhelming amount of loss and trauma in my life and its the only thing i use because i have problems with ingesting things to hurt myselfso if you havent already it might be something to look into ,1
do you go to counseling or therapy to help you cope and work on your grief?? i would do that first and foremost then get into an aa place stop drinking its not benefiting you on anyway shape or form from their work with your doctor or psychiatrist to cut down on some of those added medications that you might not need once youre in counseling and able to deal with anxiety and grief and also with the drinking because thats doing a number on your system as well i cant understand what youre going through but i have been addicted to drugs in the past and then on multiple antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills which i am no longer on if anything from where anybody is suggesting to you and trying to help please get into counseling and if you dont like your first counselor find another one its totally worth it its hard its frustrating it brings up feelings you dont want to face  but its totally worth it to gain your sanity and your self-worth and a purpose in life,1
im a mixed bipolar with severe anxiety but my mental dr put me on latuda which has helped me a great deal,1
you just have to find one that works for you i tried 4 for my anxiety til i found one that worked,1
this is my story thanks for your reply i always had anxiety and bi polar but after my son was diagnosed was when depression really hit,1
also do you exercise ? i found that to help so so much with my anxiety and depression and even my mood swing from my personality disorder i stopped taking meds completely for 13 months due to the seroquel giving me memory loss and a stutter and i felt 100x better than i ever did on meds i started taking a multi vitamin and exercising daily and i was feeling great the only reason im back on mertazapine is to help me sleep because i have really bad insomnia but it also helps majorly with my anxiety so if i feel anxious i wil take a med that day and be better i dont take them every day,1
in my opinion get off the seroquel that shit is so bad for your brain i found it made everything in my life worse harder to deal with emotions harder to control my mood swings have me memory loss and caused me to stutter the only thing it helped me with was sleep and even then i was seeing shit and hearing shit in my sleep i wouldnt recommend it for anyone my uncle has schizophrenia and bipolar and i even told him to get off the shit hes 50% better than he was on it i highly recommend mertazapine for an anti anxiety/anti depressant as i to have tried many different one and this has worked the best for me i have little to no anxiety most days everyone who ive told to try this have all had major turn around and good results everyone is different with medications but i think its worth a try goodluck,1
i found olanzapine 10mg and going gym works also avoiding alcohol,1
thuis is goed olanzapine?? also for anxiety?? ,1
i have never been in a long term love relationship and im 37 they just last a few weeks and they cant handle the darkness so i just completely stopped looking for a partner and without any real friends around i started focusing on what i can do on my own i started on a healthy diet cooking good healthy food i go for walks every other day down by the seaside with some dark (not sad) music the sight of big waves crashing violently on the rocks calms me down as for a relationship i think it might come my way maybe not i believe stressing about it wont help me but it will drag me further deep into depression i hope my short story helped good luck ,0
welcome to the group i am bipolar have social anxiety ptsd and last week was diagnosed with stomach cancer i am scared too but keep the faith this is a good group to talk to my meds make me sick too so i keep trying new ones i have been bipolar since i was in my teens so i understand you just plz keep your faith that you will get better i do and take your meds and when you need to talk post on this page,1
lamictal gave me a rash i had the worst reaction to geodon that you can have it effected my speech and coordination thank god i was in the hospital when i was on it got a shot to counter act the effects scary!!,0
i had the bad rash reaction to lamictal which made me sad because within 2 weeks i was feeling more stable and happier i tried geodon but it not only did nothing for my moods it flared up acute pancreatitis so i am back to taking only xanax to manage my anxiety and also helps curb my hypomania a bit,1
lamictal and geodon geodon worked but the withdrawls were horrible and lasted forever,0
i took wellbutrin but after about two years it began making me extremely anxious but it was great at the beginning and i dont think thats a typical reaction ive been on neurontin (gabapentin) for several years its been really great for stabilizing overall but i really need to find a good antidepressant again one that will help with anxiety i also have add but my last psychiatrist said i shouldnt be talking stimulants so im kind of a mess hopefully i can get some changes made,1
dont let your boyfriend continue to rule your life if he had chosen to leave you from your post im guessing you are fairly young are you still living at home? with a baby on the way you need support from family and friends dont ignore them ask for support its nothing to be ashamed about,0
why are you stuck at home? think of who you have for support and find comfort in them instead of someone whos trying to control you if hes choosing to leave you dont let him visit whenever he feels like it thats not fair to you you dont need stress while growing a baby ♡,0
i have bipolar 1 my bf of 15 years since we met has a hard time wants me to do more  on my good days i can do half of what i used to i often grieve for my old self but w several diagnosis i have to come to grips w this awful illness  its something you cant explain we been to many drs and it seems the older people are just dont get it at all  they think im lazy mean even faking it  im glad for this site the more its talked about more awareness comes everyday is a struggle ,0
the medication abilify 5 or 10mg changed my life it helps with paranoia i know i am a very paranoid bi polar patient after taking if for a month i was able to work through the emotions that i internalize and bottled but but what doesnt help is a partner who is not supportive,1
id tell my husband theres the door dont let it hit ya in the ass on your way out!! i have bipolarsevere depression and bad anxiety and i told my husband i really dont give a flying fuck how my husband feels about my issues cause im sure the son of a bitch is probably cheating on me we r not even in the same state!!,0
im so sorry i have depression/anxiety and i believe im bp2 i hate my job and want to do something else but have settled for staying with it unitl i just cant do it anymore luckily my wife is very supportive but she wasnt so much last year and the year before she was tired of me and threatened me unless i got help maybe if you could give your husband another chance and talked with him about how you really feel he might be able to be more thoughtful and supportive i hope so,0
i am so sorry i am bipolar 2 also and i know what you are going through my husband did not understand either been through the psychiatrist explained everything to him he said there was nothing wrong with me and after 20 yrs of marriage we got divorced and i too had a terrible time atwork the medications make me sick i have ptsd social anxiety fibromyalgia and severe rheumatoid arthritis i finaly got my disability and amstilltrying to survive,0
akathisia a feeling of muscle quivering restlessness and inability to sit still sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication,0
a feeling of muscle quivering restlessness and inability to sit still sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication,0
i had it big time along with restless leg on latuda it started about 1 month into taking it so i stopped and it resolved immediately,1
yes ive had akathisia on latuda and several other meds its horrible my pdoc prescribed cogentin for it but it didnt work for me so i had to switch anti-psychotics im on rexulti now and havent had akathisia at all,0
thank you so much for the comments and advice everyone; i am really overwhelmed by the support,0
i have rapid cycling bipolar i think everyone with bipolar has the chance of a sudden rapid cycling (circumstances environment moon phase time of year hormones) if its not normal for you then makes someone close to you aware of whats happening its hard to keep track and you will not see the shift yourself its okay just breathe if thats all you can do concentrate on that and the loud fast rushing will get quieter if you havnt experienced it before it is very frightening try writing whenever you can then when your well sift through it all you will remember the days and maybe be able to start identifying sign and your own red flag behaviours that signal a change i hope someone close is helping you through try and keep people in your loop take care l x,1
twice a year i rapid cycle just like this ive been diagnosed with bi polar since 14 and am now 33 ive also been diagnosed with schizo effective disorder agoraphobia ocd and anxiety and i am now on tygretol and wellbutrin xl and have been stable for almost 2 years but recently have had the psychosis return and been put on sulpheris (sorry spelling that one sucks) i totally get ya so many different combos so much happening i hate it the spinning but with meds and support we will all get through it hugs n positive thoughts your way,1
i had rapid cycling bipolar the swings are unbelievable just one straight after the other my depression never lasted long or never happened at all because i was straight back up there i appeared to drop from full blown mania to hyper mania then back up again i was put on olanzapine lithium and an anti depressant cant remember which one ive been on that many these meds sent me totally the other way i was a zombie anxiety and depression really bad just could not lift my depression at all and the anxiety was so bad i wanted to die any way after trying lots of different types of mood stabilisers and anti depressants i have now found what suits me i too am on lamotragine also risperidone and my antidepressants is venlofaxine i feel better than i ever have i still have bouts be just mild it took a long time to get there and i thought i never would keep taking the lamotragine and hopefully it will be your saviour too good luck x,1
honey get out and distress your baby needs that,1
first thing dont get overwhelmed change the small things u can manage first break it down to small tasks some are unchangeable erase all guilt and/ or self pity start with ur daughter and dogs look on the bright side wen u can for instance no water damage that could have been worse make urself happy before you begin to look for sumbody suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem not preaching i jus know were u are at get out in the sun around nature and people we dont want our children seeing us like that it can be a learned behavior hope i helped at all,0
were listening! it seems like youre going though a lot right now do you have a psychotherapist? i find its really helpful talking to someone who understand mental illness she makes it about me and my feelings as a person not my illness and helps me find ways to cope and deal with stress so i can stay grounded i suggest psychotherapy to help you through this difficult time,0
thats a lot of things to be dealing with all at once without enough money or enough support it must feel overwhelming you have a lot of responsibilities and things you are trying to solve but you need help im not sure how to help but i think some of it will work out somehow if you have a little patience first one thing will be solved then another until you are in a different situation and state of mind it may not seem possible to solve these problems now because so much is happening at once but things will change it is so great that you rescued two pitbulls that is a wonderful thing for you to do they arent always so lucky to have someone like you helping them keep on helping them and loving your daughter one day at a time the other stuff is less important make sure you are on some good medications that work for you because you need to be stable while going through these challenges,1
hi there so sorry for all your troubles with so many anxieties youre dealing with negative circumstance will only add to your dilemma you seem very confuse even on little things and i understand because of the mental illness i would suggest a simple step its still up to you though since you know yourself better than i do (1) get a piece of paper and write down all your problems (2) put big problems small problems in a column and think through which one you want to prioritize first then second third and so on this might seem silly to you but our perspective normally change when we see in writing that some problems are not really worth worrying too much about and yet some problems also needs quick action on our part ❤️ this might help as well see the link take care ❤️ ,0
sounds like you need to visit the doctor you seem a bit confused you could be bipolar but youre not actually very clear about what youre saying go and see the doctor and have a talk,0
i think she wants to know shes not alone and that someone cares maybe get some advice from others in similar high stress situations about how to deal everything shes going through ,0
shes speaking about her battles & looking for some comforting words if not suggestions to help her situation compassion never hurt anyone every person who is a part of this page would appreciate this i find your comment unnecessary "if you dont know what shes asking if anything" dont comment if it were on my post id be upset!,0
i would just say to you it is very early days and it is normal to be looking at the service sheet etc you are coming to terms with your very sad loss and you are probably in so much shock you think it is a nightmare you will wake up from you dont want it to be real if you are struggling then contact a bereavement association or councillor its never weak to ask for help it is our strength that permits us to admit we are struggling even medication can help you through but remember it is very early days a week is no time at all,0
yes i had sever post-partum depression after my second child it was the scariest thing i ever went through i did not have this when my daughter was born i have always had depression but when my son was born it was unbelievable i had thoughts of wanting to kill my own son! i wanted him to be another girl i knew that this was not me but i could not stop the thoughts from coming luckily we had a close friend that was a neurologist that told my husband to get me to the doctor right away it still took almost 8 months for me to recover on meds i could not remember how to write my own name if i showered i could not remember if i washed my hair or put on my conditioner please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away it can get worse it is dangerous for you and your child or children feel free to message me if you need to talk dont wait to care for yourself you need to care for yourself first so that you can care for other s later,0
that pretty much sums up my ptsd & anxiety!,1
funny these all fit we are more anxious due to the fact that we see and understand more of what we see going on around us and it stresses us,0
seriously i have always thought my ability to think reasonably clearly in very chaotic and stressful environments was a very minor superpower i thought it was due to being brought up by doctors and nurses but this suggests my neurodiversity might be part of the reason (recent add diagnosis added to anxiety and depression),1
adhd anxiety and depression whuuuut? why am i not the best damn person in the world yet? xd,0
creativity comes in lots of forms its not just about drawing or playing piano (anxiety depression and add mean i am a compassionate and creative problem solver),1
it really is  i have had personal experience of this its very frightening !!!,0
panic attacks anxiety attacks is not good im just thankful my medication works cause mine get so bad i end up at the er,1
thanks sagaren lm so happy that you found the strength to conquer the feelings of insecurity and lack of self worth i pray that through your post above many will see a seed they can plant and are able to implement the three steps to self healing we need our meds perhaps for the rest of our lives but as with diabetes or hypertension our minds may need these too these various chemicals are critical to stabilize the much needed balance and hopefully we find that balance the rest is up to us and even more critical l believe we have to stop all the inward-directed thoughts i have i have i have (sorry everyone) sure we have but with the practice you outline above we can begin to make even one small shift in our minds one small shift of mindset today followed by another small shift next month followed by more and more and bringing some small degree of happiness to ourselves! all by ourselves what an achievement! go tell your doc/psych what youve achieved tell your family - no show them the new you! you have the power it lies within the mind that makes you dwell on the negatives try hard to be kind to yourself learn to love yourself find the happiness and joy that lies within you sending everyone struggling and hurting all my love i shall keep you in my prayers love and showers of blessing film <3 <3,0
ill ask a question to answer: do you notice any thought patterns activities times of day places you go where you notice your mood shifts dramatically? or is it more sporadic? i believe (do your own research) that the former is normal in people with bpd and features in bipolar ii not as familiar with ptsd yet but im starting my own research on that one however you would know yourself best and if this feels different or worries you that it feels worse than usual hit up your therapists & medical team for advice,0
amen to that i have bipolar pstd ocd anxiety panic my brain is full :(,1
yes i had sever post-partum depression after my second child it was the scariest thing i ever went through i did not have this when my daughter was born i have always had depression but when my son was born it was unbelievable i had thoughts of wanting to kill my own son! i wanted him to be another girl i knew that this was not me but i could not stop the thoughts from coming luckily we had a close friend that was a neurologist that told my husband to get me to the doctor right away it still took almost 8 months for me to recover on meds i could not remember how to write my own name if i showered i could not remember if i washed my hair or put on my conditioner please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away it can get worse it is dangerous for you and your child or children feel free to message me if you need to talk dont wait to care for yourself you need to care for yourself first so that you can care for other s later,0
i had it and anxiety too some people with post natal depression dont bond with their baby but i did but you feel youre all alone and letting your baby down you feel youre not a good mother you think that everybody thinks youre a bad mother you cry all the time my anxiety meant i would not let my baby out of my sight i wouldnt let my husband take him anywhere alone if he did i would be pacing up and down unable to rest till he was back crying all the time he was away from me i felt that i would never see him again that something would happen to him because i wasnt there to protect him i hid it all away from the midwife and health visitor because i was frightened theyd take him off me it was three years later when i was medicated for it i had taken my son to the doctors and she noticed i didnt look right and asked me it all came flooding out and she gave me some prozac to help so please dont leave it like i did go see your gp straight away before it gets any worse my son is 22 now but i remember the nightmare so clearly hope you feel better soon good luck x,0
meds love them or hate them one needs them like a fish needs water or a diabetic needs insulin or blood pressure meds or anti inflammatories for arthritis so whence the hate? change that to necessity be creative i hate the packets i have two small lunchboxes one with a sticker of a little girl watering her plants (am) and the other with her in her nightie (pm) i typed a list of each lot of meds plus how many and glued it to the inside of each lid (in case family needs to know) i keep the tubs at the table where l watch tv and over the years have learned (after stopping twice) and suffering the awful outcomes that l need these little things in order not to melt into a pile of bones i know i need them during the day but especially at night to help me sleep sometimes l get into bed and just cant sleep then l realize ah ha! i forgot my evening meds so make your meds containers pretty accept that you have to take them truly this will help you wishing you much happiness and stability <3,1

yes there are depression causes stress stress causes headaches i do body scan meditation and that helps me relax,1
steps to loving yourself and living with this monster refuse to give him more power over your life i hope you dont think me presumptuous with my posts but lve been in the darkest pit but am gratefully coping okay nowadays when something bad strikes it knocks me down hard and i fear i may not be able to rise again but by the grace and power and by faith l manage to crawl back into the sunshine and oh how glorious that is wishing you lifetimes of sunshine <3 <3,0
been in both the jaws of this monster both of them very frightening but praise god and the help of two very inspirational people who constantly shot at me with bullets of powerful positive reinforcement  and gratefully the correct blend of meds and very patient listeners one day i thought to myself l have to change the conversations ld been having with myself change my internal dialogue i was advised to find at least three things about myself that have merit/value or things i liked about myself tough one 1 even with the terrible highs and lows my superior at the military hospital where l worked once told me l have a charming disposition wow it stuck with me my ingenious and artistic gift :-o and my voice over the pa announcement system which gifts do you have? write them down beautiful hair beautiful smile? personality? the gifts/blessings must be there i promise people? those who love you matter and those who dont understand or love you? make like a duck and shrug them off your shoulders and out of your life dont waste a single moment trying to explain things be strong and resist reject every single negative thought  get up tomorrow morning forget every yesterday of sadness refuse to allow your mind to poison you anymore tell yourself out loud that i want to get better you can pick up the pieces little by little and take small but positive st,0
i wasnt trying to blackmail you im crying out for help i did cut myself i just didnt show the police and didnt want you to worry im sorry i just missed you,0
ok yes i get this but i have one point to make and please dont get too mad at me for this sometimes giving up on someone even someone with a serious mental health issue that is in no way their fault it the right thing to do not because the person isnt worth the time or effort to support and help them in any and every way you can but because being with that person whether being their friend or significant other is physically or mentally damaging for you i knew someone who had some serious issues that were in no way his fault + i wanted to help him and did everything i could to try and help him but being with him was seriously damaging for me my mental health is in no way as bad as his but i still have issues with anxiety and depression and being in that relationship messed me up more than i could cope with so i ended up giving up because it was the only way out i could see where i didnt end up killing myself (something id been close to at times because of this persons actions) tldr im not saying you shouldnt do anything you can to support people with mental health issues and be there for them to help them but if it is physically or mentally damaging for you then you shouldnt sacrifice your own health for someone elses no matter how much you want to help them,0
yeah but people without a mental illness dont seem to get it they say they understand but their patience dissolves into frustration which no doubt its frustrating but how much more is it for those with the illness its like with any illness ailment disease disability or limitation its hard to put yourself in that persons shoes but its always worse for them,0
that is so wonderful you have someone who understands and is supportive i have bipolar disorder 1 as well as major depressive disorder ptsd and panic attacks beyond normal my husband has been by my side the entire time and has even gone to classes to learn more about my disorders we are lucky to have such wonderful partners ,1
usa for you 1 off the most ill countries on earth and take more drugs than anyone else my friend was on strong depression tablets and he was so sad and down all the time i told him he will always be the same untill he quits them he was unsure at 1st he went down little by little ending on a quarter of a tablet now on nothing they have there social life back go out and is happy again,0

i will always be on meds for my bi polar 1 and my anxiety and ptsd too til i die,1

then babies need u not another person taking care of them i have bipolar ptsd anxiety still here yes i get to the point i also have e3little ones i have to get up for and depression i do it cause no one can take mamas place ❤❤❤❤get the meds working please,1
this zee person obviously doesnt know a single thing about the reason/origin of the causes of the various conditions of the mind they are extremely complex in origin and after all the centuries of medical investigations and expertise the medical professionals can still only hazard a guess and experiment with the thousands of drugs available to try to obtain a combination that works single parenthood??? most certainly not its easy to be judgemental until it strikes you! so i would tread very lightly before another careless word is typed here it could just cause the push over an edge that for some of us is a very narrow one i am bp2 after a severe head injury as a teenager and it changed my entire lifeand has worsened as the years stresses and misfortunes have taken their toll so the stresses and misfortunes caused by the illness exacerbated the condition which caused more impulsive and wrong decisions which led to more stress and misfortune so please be careful what you say to someone words once they leave your mouth cannot be taken back and the effects they can have on many may be an eternal sentence of doom but i forgive you for your comments ignorance is bliss but be warnedyou may need our advice someday,1
sorry zee im the 33 year old i was married for 9 years 3 babies to that one man too may i add just in case bipola is caused by having kids to different men my mother and father have been married for 41 years last feb and she too also suffers depression and anxiety my father always by her side no matter what so that marriage shit you can put it up your nose n blow it outta your bum dumb things that come out of some peoples mouths can and will one day push that suicidal person over the edge got nothing nice to say keep it to your self hope to god you dont ever be in a place not only am i in but 1000s of people too,0
actually thats not true i was a single mother with my oldest son for a while  i was so happy i cant ever remember being more happy now i have two sons n am with my youngest sons father he loves my oldest like his own takes care of both the boys and me hes amazing  but im miserable relationships can take a toll on bipolar people sometimes its better not to be with someone kids or not,0
what so ever  i strongly believe that the problem with her is that she have kids without father single parental kids and their father or mother which one is living with them often spend disturb lives,0
i have been on bipolar meds anti-depressants anxiety meds sleeping meds adhd med etc spent time in amsterdam (where its legal) found that marijuana treated all these problems they are even more affective than what big pharm has to offer now that you dont have to smoke it i cant see any reason not to use it medicallyexcept its illegal even if you qualify the clinics need your other drs approval i really dont see that happening too often most drs want to keep you as a repeat customer so most drs arent going to give approval,1
i suffer from depression and anxiety usually lasts about three weeks but i try to focus on family and work before i got on meds i was a complete mess,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a decade ago and i used to self medicate until it almost killed me now im taking a more holistic approach meditation has helped me immensely and is proven to lower stress levels and a ton of other benefits thats the only thing i can recommend but i too sleep a lot and find it extremely hard to leave the house but the rage has definitely decreased a lot and i know its bc of the meditation i do i need to be more adamant about making it a daily practice instead of waiting til im way far off kilter and have to meditate my way back to sanity but it does help to some degree i just dont know if i can do the whole lab rat thing anymore ive been on probably 40 + different meds over the years sometimes 6-8 prescriptions at a timeand meditation has helped me more than any of them i can only speak from my own experience but i think everyone can benefit from meditation and its worth looking into you might be surprised by what exactly meditation isas well as what it isnt best wishes <3,1
honestly my best resource has just been youtube i would start with a video called something like "buddhist monk explains meditation" its a really good place to start bc the video explains exactly what meditation is and isnt if you cant find the video im speaking of let me know and ill find you the link meditation is a deeply personal thing and i think it should be customized to what serves each person best and the great part about it is you can literally do it any time during any activity its more about retraining your brain rather than trying to clear your mind of all thought feel free to add me as a friend and ill help in any way i can i know the struggle and if i can help lighten the load for one person or help them find some hope and peace that would help me as much as them <3 hope you find this helpful,0
yes my thoughts exactly i am on a lot of medication and live with the side effects everyday because my 4 kids need a mum who is semi- functional if i dont take me meds woaah- scary stuff can happen,1
not many drs prescribe lithium anymore as there are "better newer " ones my boyfriends on lithium and the change has been amazing! we naturally have lithium in our brains but a lot of depression anxiety etc comes from our lithium levels being outta whack should definitely see a dr and ask to get his levels checked and hopefully start him on it!,1
i think it will be the best med for your boyfriend without a doubt ,1
amber i understand when i was first got sick and a few times in between the road is quite bumpy its not a good journey and very scary you are probably the first person that he lashes at because he loves you and youre the closest person to him you need to take care of yourself as well especially if you suffer with depression sometimes you will have to distance yourself if you can for self-preservation the best medication for me has been lithium plus amisulipride and duloxeteine i think the lithium is a universal med and available in the us it is one of the older types of medication but it is reliable and it works well maybe it will be worth having a conversation with the doctor tomorrow about it ,1
you can take natural stuff for the aches and to reduce the inflammation in your body you can take ginger in a shakeor tea sperilina activate charcoalbathes with epson salt essential oilswhite willow bark accupunturemassage stretching very dayhot yoga juice fast but still take your meds on the juice fast sanas steamroom meditation  there a couple that the stuff that has worked for me i not a doctor but i reaserched alot about depressionand all that stuff has worked for me hope it helps,1
for me massage therapy works wonders on my body getting regular massages can really help with the pain associated with depression/anxiety drinking lots of water can aid in the muscles not being as tight when the pain is bad and i cant get to a massage session i take ibuprofen but be careful as too much can mess your stomach up oh and get a new doctor this one that you have is wrong,1
i get intense deep muscle aches all the time its not in my head either its the worst part of my anxiety disorder i have over the counter wrist braces for when my fingers burn and those help i use a lot of icy hot and that helps for a bit as well i reluctantly take aspirin but it does help a bit too those are the only things i can do anymore myself i hope this helps you a bit its not in your head an it may not even be the medication depression/anxiety does take a physical toll or as i had one doctor explain to me "all pain is biologically in your head pain is real",1
ive found bath& body works stress relief helps it comes in bath and lotion form ingredients are spearmint and eucalyptus,1
i get an irritation feeling in my body like someone scratching on the chalkboard i also have fibromyalgia and i take a pain pill or tumeric tumeric works better than pain pills get a medical doctor to test you for fibromyalgia my body aches when i get stressed or eat too many sweets,1
i take welbutrine to help with the irritation trazadone helps with insomnia,1
interesting michelle that you mentioned that you get that irritation feeling in your body bcuz im experiencing that! i didnt know a good way to describe it but thats it! im diagnosed bipolar (last year) and general anxiety - i currently take 150 mg seroquel 40 mg celexa 20 mg paxil and 1 mg xanax at night (but i just stopped taking the xanax a few days ago) but now im wide awake anyway i have that same odd sensation i was going to mention to my dr next week,0
fibro and bipolar/anxiety/borderline here turmeric as in the spice like my dad used in pickling stuff!? ive never heard of that stress and temp changes (overly hot or cold) are my main triggers stress has been off the charts lately due to new medical issues being diagnosed so fibro has joined the party big time,1
i ache all over it takes me about half an hour to rev my joints up i find sport relieves my aching painful body but it takes real self motivation to do as i doubt my ability then the anxiety and headsweats kick in but i have to do it to keep supple and i feelat my best when i do sport,1
i have the same issue my old dr moved away and the new one doesnt get why after 10 years he had me on vicodin and xanax because nothing else worked trial and error of psych meds nearly killed me more than once i cant take ibuprofen or gabapentin due to pancreatitis but new dr is so worried about them being addictive and high risk for resale if my old doc trusted me for so many years with never missing a follow up test and never asking for more or higher doses why not give me what we knew works?!,1
first get a new doctor because a doctor thats telling you that its all in your head is a piece of shit second i take 1200mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day i know its a lot but thats what it takes when things get really bad like from my ra my doc will give me a single script of morphine or vicodin ive also found that weighted blankets are fabulous for body aches i have one that weighs 25 pounds and believe it or not it helps calm anxiety attacks too,1
if i try to go without it  i need to do it three times as much and trying to restrain myself drives me nuts and i think about it all time church didnt help it just made me feel guilty 24 /7 thank god i just masterbate alot to cope with it to keep the cravings down  i love masterbating  i think everyone does,0
thank you! thats been the only way for me i could not go out there to find satisfaction for it would weigh heavy on my conscience i would never be able to forgive myself for *using* another for my own personal need/gain i do not judge others to each his own right i just wasnt brave enough to try it wouldve been more satisfying no doubt there was also the fear of being rejected i dont think that would have happened but the fear was always there but for me my butterfly is my favorite ( the urgency can and has happened away from home) tmi - my apologies,0
my sex drive has gone to litterly nothing over the last 2 yrs i am 35 i feel sorry for my husband in a way but i cant give in to his needs because than i would feel dirty used etc and i refuse to do that to me yes i do hear about well back when you were a teenager or in tour early 20s you enjoyed sex or he threatens to go elsewhere and i have started to say ok go if you need i am working on me right now and clearly you dont understand what i am going through i have aniexty/panic attacks sever depression bipolar ptsd ocd chronic fatigue,0
i have almost no libido at all and i am diagnosed with bipolar depression (bipolar ii) i also have other mental illnesses as well like panic disorder and terrible anxiety but could also be my meds either way i dont think that one symptom overrides all the others get a second opinion,1
i agree this is something that no one talks about because you get called names what people dont understand is that its really a sickness and an overwhelming addiction it ruined my first marriagepraise jesus he helped me through it ive been a faithful wife for 5 years on my second marriage ❤️,0
and the guilt is excruciating,0
the guilt nearly crucified me and like you say no one to talk to i totally empathise here have felt exactly the same if this was a closed group i could talk more feel free to pm me if you want to talk x,0
more scary than anything my period started and didnt stop for six months (pergesterone stops your period estrogen makes you ovulate) and because testosterone is produced elsewhere i now have alot of unwanted hair across my body which im insecure about and that definitely doesnt help the libido issues but after that all happened they tried me on lithium which made me overly suicidal so got taken off it and they dont want to try any other meds because of the issues so have had to do a bunch of therapy to teach me other ways to cope and try to control the swings and recognize them etc its hard and definitely not easy to be with me just hoping we can sort out our issues and fix things before its too late,1
im so sorry that sounds miserable :(,0
do not ever give up your medication as this is only complimentry as well as it cant get rid of the chemical imbalance that it is always take meds when its a very serious mental condition it was an horrendous time when some stupid new dr told me to stop taking some tabs and try others but stopping straight away after 20 odd years of taking them all hell broke loose panic attacks every day:( eventually after quite a while tbh they finally found the right mood stabiliser as they said i had been on anti depressents that just made me manic more they never diagnosed bi polar till 11 year ago:(,1
lamictal saved my life started on 25 upped very slowly to avoid rash now on 300 mg been on it 15 yrs im bipolar 2 psychiatrist has had to adjust antidepressants over the years to keep depression at bay but mania is controlled perfectly and the constant roller coaster of moods is gone i used to cycle a lot my daughter is bipolar 2 as well and is on 200 mg lamictal also,1
i found it took months for lamictal to kick in and i struggled for months and still do if youre concerned talk to your doctor because there are other stabilizers out there i waited to talk to my doctor until i was on a stable dose because it keeps going up until the doctor thinks its appropriate to stop upping the dosage,1
i can relate to what youre going through im struggling right now too just had a bad reaction to a new drug i recently started yes it gets extremely frustrating at times but please know youre not alone i have struggled with most of the available mood stabilizers in fact there is only one i havent yet taken i dont respond well to these meds so my psychiatrist recently recommended genetic testing thats been a real eye opener and finally explained why there were problems taking certain meds i recommend to anyone who has been unsuccessful with medications,0
talk to your dr about this there are other pills than lamictal finding the right combo of pills can be horrible but youll get there!,1
if reaching out to me is something you feel may helpim here and ive shut many out on my journey and been so scared its like ill never walk out the door living alone trapped for many monthsso i mean it when i say im here for you,0
i didnt like this stuff my anxiety was horrible and anxiety medications didnt help much i am off all medications now (cause im pregnant) and feel much much better i hope you feel good soon ❤,1
unfortunately getting the right dose and playing lab rat sometimes is needed to find the right meds at the right doses it took me 18 mths to find that lithium mirtazapine and olanzapine worked for my bipolar i and anxiety i know all to well the limbo you feel you need to speak with your psychiatrist and tell them how you feel open honest communication is key i keep a mood journal and practice cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness there are plenty of resources on the web and mindfulness apps for your phone take care,1
do you take anything extra for your anxiety?,1
yes but i got diagnosed with anxiety along with depression and the anxiety meds made all the diff!!!!,1
yepmy depression makes me angrysadand impatient,1
yes all the time  so easily overwhelmed,0
please find a new doctor who will address your liver failure that is scary do not let that go on,1
dont worry dear things will take its path im bipolar my both daughters are epileptic and both are studying to be teachers we are also going through a bad tym their father is unemployed and we dont hv an income but we use each other for strength thats wat helps us through im sure u hv yr family so draw yr strength from them you will get through it god bless sweet heart,1
i have taken it for psychiatric purposes it didnt agree with me but i think im more of the exception than the rule a friend of mine that has als takes it for her als it can be used for nerve pain as well lyrica is the best for nerve pain however lyrica induced depression in me ive heard so many uses for it although i also have never heard it prescribed for anxiety dont be discouraged by my experience i have met plenty of people that it works well for stay in close touch & be totally honest with your dr be patient its well worth it in the end:-),1
just remember everyone is different they gave it to my adult son for anxiety and for some nerve damage he had it helped no side effects and didnt have a hard time getting off of it unfortunately it is trial by fire for all drugs but it is also a process of elimination too god speed,1
didnt work for only because maybe ive been on benzos for ten yrs nothing is better for anxiety then benzos they ate addictive tho ,1
i just started it two weeks ago i also take prozac and geodon i have bp 2 so far it makes me feel like im in a fog i have a hard time waking up several nights ive confused dreams with reality and vice versa ive not been bothered enough by the side effects to stop taking it,0
i take gabapentin for fibromyalgia but my anxiety is still really horrible i didnt even know it was prescribed for anxiety,0
seratonin syndrome put me in the hospitali felt horrible and had terrible side effects,0
ive been an rn almost 25 years but havent been able to work almost 2 with all 5hose years nursing and my own psych history i can honestly say 5his is the first i have heard of gabapentin being prescribed for anxiety i am very familiar with it for neuropathy im not knocking it because docs prescribe meds for other than their intended purpose all the time just saying this is first i ever heard of it weird ive taken some of my boyfriends trying to ease this nerve pain im having that docs dont believe i have and i can say it dont do shit for my body bad nerves or my anxiety either so,1
horrible med!!! i just detoxed from it i was only on it for a few months and the withdrawals were bad!! not nearly as bad as all the side effects tho i thought i had ms due to all of them messed me up neurologically,0
my sister is bipolar and has horrible anxiety like myself and she is taking gabapentin and klonopin and she is down a few doses of her klonopin i take gralise which is gaba extended release and it helps me some ,1
if anyone else wants to try gaba you can order it from "thorne research" i take the "pharma gaba 250" they make a lower dose as well for sleep i take l-tryptophan capsules at bedtime i also take gaba with it puts me to sleep & the next morning im not groggy or hungover feeling gaba is calming if i feel anxious i take 1 or 2 gaba capsules i have xanax at my disposal yet its a good idea to substitute gaba for xanax when possible gaba doesnt make you tired like xanax or other benzos it decreases anxiety though:-),1
i was put on it in my hospital has to stop not helping with my anxiety it made my speach bad and very blurred vision  now im in bluspalits worked very good,1
i took it for migraines didnt work for me i ended up in the hospital with serotonin syndrome bc the side effects were so bad i ended up in the hospital i would call your doctor tomorrow and tell them whats going on it made my depression really bad to where i was crying and had bad thoughts my anxiety was so high i kept on having panic attacks,1
i take it for nerve damage my anxiety is still shit tho,1
i love my got a pad at work good for my pain and my anxiety,1
they gave it to me for my anxiety and depression and for the nerve damage i got in a wreak it helped nothing and made my anxiety and all much much worse,1
gave me horrible migraines,0
i careworryetcjust have no strength i guess to get up and do anything just dont know what to do,0
how can i sleep though when all my anxious thoughts come rushing back at bed time ttatt,0
i dont have a problem now thanks to a week at a time day and night pill box and phone alarms piece of cake the pill boxes are less than $10 simple and effective,0
 always happends to me for the most part i blame the fibro fog because of the fibromyalgia i have but it isn very risky and annoying when i cant remember if i took my antidepressants or no to ,0
sucks horribly going through these especially in front of my eight year old little boy it scares the crap outta him ,0
these suck and unless you have experienced one u cant relate to the horror,0
sitting here reading these messages with tears in my eyesive suffered for 17 years with it and depression and panic attacks i feel for each and everyone of you i dont no wht being normal is anymore  ive tried most things to try and help me but not 1 thing has worked so if anyone has any helpful tips on this plz tell us ty xx,1
mine hide pretty well i can be freaking out unable to breathe and still function still keep working im shaking unable to breathe eyes dilated feeling like i need to run run run im terrified of something i cant consciously see but i keep working i keep moving i cant sit and break down sometimes i can separate myself and work on breathing but usually i cant my zoloft helps control those better so i havent been slammed with these attacks in a while,0
hi ally so sorry for your dilemma it mustve been hard dealing with it i know its not easy anxiety involves feelings of uneasiness nervousness or worry because we live in an uncertain world bouts of anxiety can overtake any of us however please dont give up ❤️ id like to share this with you that might be of help; as it already did many others please take care ❤️ ,1
first: i know exactly what i get i dont need you trying to explain it second: this post specifically says anxiety attacks maybe read first before trying to look down on me,1
basically you get anxiety attacks the post however describes panic attacks,1
lol how can you read my comments on here?? i dont care that you can but can others? im brutally honest on these sites because o feel like there is no judgment and i dont know anyone lol my attacks are causing me to question do i need mental help? like im terrified to be one my own what happens when my anxiety hits am i going to be able to care for my kids properly?? my head is a mess my thoughts come and go so quickly and mix with each other im like unable to function some days i feel like im rocking the world and then other days i feel im letting the world down and am a huge failure to everything i have tried in my life i love my kids but i question my strength im tired of feeling this way i want to wake with energy and filled with life i dont know how i have people telling me how and it sounds great and something i am interested in but am i strong enough lately i dont have the strength to run to the mailbox ,0
the past few weeks have been horrible for me im getting paralyzing panic attacks they are horrivle and almost always hit me as soon as my eyes open before i can even think of anything my heart is racing insides turning to liquid and quickly escaping my body uncontrollable shaking i feel my heart racing like im running for my life and i start to tyr and control my breathing i feel so broken im a mom of 2 who is pretty much single so when these happen i feel like im not even good enough to be a mom i am doing therapy but im not sure what else can help or how much longer i can mentally handeling having these,0
i feel like that myself for weeks and today i was shaking and cryingits a horrible feeling and my anxiety level is over the roofdont feel like doing anythingso i know exactly how you feel,0
now thats a real anxiety attack! i have had to pull over on the side of road or in a parking lot to call my mother because she knows exactly what to say to me to calm me down,0
it takes time i have been on it for 10 months and mood swings have settled down just make sure you dont hav the shakes or any other sise effect too it took a couple of adjustments to my dose to reach where i am now,1
this has been the hardest for me i used to be a fairly outgoing social person now making a phone call to my daughters school leads to a panic attack and rage it is so tiring,1
wow!!! i never knew in school i would literally try to make myself as small as possible so as to not be touched publicly i have always hated shopping alone or paying for stuff alone i get all red faced and embarrassed i really hate eating alone as i feel extremely fat not just a little bit but like i am suddenly triple my size i cant even go christmas shopping without dragging a friend along to keep my nerves calm heck 1 time even with them i wound up sitting on the floor crying for no reason and all they did was sit on the floor next to me and talk me through it then we were able to continue,0
90% of the above its horrible,0
im a bipolar doctor never met a borderline i didnt like and admire  my last partner of 2 years was borderline volatile and explosive at times  a strong intelligent independent and humorous woman despite some difficulty i gained much from our relationship and we remain good friends be proud of who you are embrace your different ways of operating no shame you have endured much and tour and best is in front of you persistence and look to take the chance to be kind whenever the opportunity arises john x,0
lol i had to laugh but its so not funny living like that on a regular!! so dysfunctional and irritating!! especially when youve been you doctors medication guinea pig for several years and still no progress!! then they wonder why the only time i leave the house is to when i have to do something for my kids,1
future problem worry about the now sweet lady!! ,0
i dont doubt your grandfathers wise words its a matter of my anxiety making it difficult to believe that,1
a piece of advice i was given by my grandfather that always held true was 99% of what you worry about never happens if you can just try to go by that your thoughts should start to settle down,0
thank you sometimes its my way of closure but sometimes it can be my down fall my major problem is that it keeps on working all the time so many thoughts and no breaks within my mind im always thinking my mind is never silent and its always about things that most in the world dont think about nor worry about thus making me feel like i am slowly going insane i feel like i am stuck in a world of people that are unaware of the hidden dangers amongst the many i so rarely find people that think the same as me and view things truly open minded i am self aware of my own faults as well as others its a blessing and a curse all together,0
i can really understand and feel the way its a daily struggle! you just wrote everything i go thru n feel! i have anxiety ptsd bpo i self harm alot more then ever now cuz all i hear is how im not good enough and i cant do anything right!,0
it could but the horror of it all is that you carry this darkness around all the time and there are many moments when all of that stuff doesnt matter to you anymore i understand everyone has some type of problem in life but i would honestly rather be homeless and starving than deal with the shit that goes on inside my mind 24/7,0
another small gem given me by a beloved friend that my attitude is more important than the facts and its not about what happens to us its what we do with what happens to us which will determine whether we go up or down and something lve struggled with for awhile up to last friday our negative thoughts create our own reality and the best little cliche lol our attitude determines our altitude! find something to laugh about read some funny jokes online watch a funny movie take a walk on the beach see all the beauty surrounding us rejoice! and you shall rejoice again one day you shall again know happiness and peace each one of us holds the seeds to our own unhappiness within us but we also hold our happiness there we are left to make the choice and remember that our happiness doesnt lie in our partner or in things lets choose to be happy bless you <3,0
oh wow i know all about these feelings as described above each and every one of them they used to hound me every minute of every day until i lived in this awful vacuum that was slowly sucking me in and sucking my life out suicide seemed the only way to escape the pain the frustration the black clouds surrounding me the black pit that was my life threatened to drown me in its slime my daughter had by now completely rejected me but i can understand why there was so much hurt from emotional abuse ld suffered from the men in my life (l was unable to be all l should have been in my marriages because of the awful love/hate l felt for my verbally abusive dad) diagnosed bp ii in 2008 after a severe head injury and full left hemiplegia motorcycle accident 75 l struggled to keep going but the anger and rage poured out on my elderly late husband every night ( dangerously stressful job with severe discrimination harassment and sexual harassment for ten years ) i was severely suicidal and told my very wise and wonderful sister of all my problems i was shocked stunned ive never seen her like that she told me that shed wanted to tell me for a long time she said "stop feeling sorry for yourself!! youre healthy physically you have eyes ears and all four limbs stop being a martyr stop all the me me me me me and get a life!!! think about all you have start being grateful she loves joyce meyer and loves her popular phrase "stinkinthinkin get rid of it!! find something youre passionate about and do it whatever it is help others less fortunate than yourself climb out of yourself start being kind to yourself start loving yourself spoil yourself stay on your meds change your life only you can well thanks very much missy lm older than you how dare you speak to me like that??? but you want to know something? today l live a wonderful positive peaceful and happy life whenever negative thoughts try to creep in l say out loud move back on out l wont allow you to destroy me again speak to god he is right there to help you and he will we screwed up in paradise and that is why we have illnesses to try us but through the lord we can and will overcome may god bless you in your new mindset love felicity,0
sounds like its time to say when i was desperate for my marriage to work in the process i now see i stayed too long dont waste anymore of your precious time on your husband if a person cant meet you half way then find someone that will im so much happier all alone than i ever was when i was married some people arent marriage material know that you cant change that,0
i know for my fiance and i we struggle with communication so theres always a point where we sit on our bed and just have a talk i let him go first and he can vent and talk about how he is handling things what hes stressed about etc then i will chime in dont blame him for the way he is feeling or anything like that just focus on trying to understand each others thoughts and feelings i am so sorry that you are experiencing this i really hope i was able to help at all,0
im type 2 also and with high anxiety be patient and kind to yourself it might take a while to get the meds thatll work for you but you will,1
the meds antidepressants make me paranoid remeron lexapro,0
have you changed meds? some of the side affects are dry mouth and that caused some dental problems for me have a dental appt tomorrow and im anxious about it,1
such simple words - doubt theyll ever help me ,1
agree and i think that is why some of us worry so some things are simply out of our human control!,0
most of what not to say has been said to me by my family who from the word go had decided that they werent going to acknowledge my ptsdsevere depanxiety issuesit is during this time that i needed them the most  that they decided not to be there for mea couple of years on now and they still dont support me what so evernever even ask me simple things like - do you eat regulardo you manage to sleepdo you manage to get any support-just nothingwell what i learnt was family isnt always loyal,0
no your not you can talk to me anytime you need yes i have anxiety depression ocd ptsd panic attacks and i have all kinds of medical issues that go with that oh and lets not forget my favorite id love to beat myself up you know i dont need anyone to say what i should or shouldnt do i do a good job of that myself but really if you ever need someone i will be the most least judgemental person you will ever meet my name is amy and you can reach me through my facebook page or just by instant messaging me,0
a lot of people have no idea what its like to have severe depression they are very fortunate but because they once had a bit of a low period they think theyve had depression and judge it on their experience they have no idea how debilitating it is you just get looked at like youre talking a load of crap and exaggerating its the same with anxiety its pure torture and they dont believe you because they once had a bit of anxiety and it wasnt as bad as youre making out would love to see how these people would cope with severe anxiety and depression theyd never judge us again,0
what if youre too afraid to be in public?,0
you could try to meditate go on youtube and put in guided meditation for bipolar or for anger insomnia anxiety stress any of these things i used to walk away and go and meditate initially up to 8 times a day make sure its guided though and not just the music the breathing is important my personal faves are jason stephenson and the honest guys good luck so hard without meds change doc as soon as you can once your finances are sorted but do not let him win by having self doubt keep your studies up,0
i hate the term(just shy)and a lot of people with mental illness have drug problems from self medicating years before they seek helpi dont like this doctori hope he doesnt discourage you from future helpgood for you for tryinggod bless,1
i struggle with bipolar everyday i was diagnosed when i was 9 its hard at times especially when youre in a despesive state ive learned my own coping methods like if i want to say something rude i think of my favorite song or i take a deep breaths ive also noticed if i have something in my hand all the time like a stone or anything small i will rub it constintally and it helps a lot to keep me calm and focused,0
my 34 year old son has come up with his own techniques when he is angry he holds up his hand like stop and that is our cue not to talk to him when he returns to us and starts talking then we know its safe to talk to him again when he gets anxious he rides stationary bike paces a lot does other yard work etc he used to write a journal which i do think is a great idea hope you can get to another dr quickly if you are in the us you might try calling mhmr here in texas or at least where we are they will treat you for free,1
mindfulness is a godsend for me to help dealing with my anxiety and anger there are plenty of resources on the net explaining what it is and what to do there are even apps for your phone dont get too caught up on a diagnosis keep a mood journal so when you can see another dr you can show them to help diagnosis take care,1
i know the gym has been mentioned i gone to the gym for 19 years it the best angry release start off slow if you cant join a gym youcan always take long walks you can adjust your diet too it makes a big difference try meditating it will be hard a first but your mind will get used to itput on some relaxing music it well calm the mind take baths cover your head with a beany  they say that some mental illness are due to some abnormal swelling in the head go in side a sana or steam room try taking coconut oil ginger  sperilina omega to help with the swelling of the head if you can get accupuntureor massage to reduce the tension  yoga  steraching journaling has help me track my triggers i just send my self text message to track my triggers and talk about it with a therapist aroma therapy essential​ oils to calm the mind,1
ive had the same issue and all my life - im highly sensitive and my family life was a chaotic mess as my parents were narcissists and bipolar i went through hell ive learned a few things to share 1) eat healthy food at regular times per day 2) avoid sugary and fatty foods as they fuel problems 3) write letters daily to yourself write out your pain fear and anger put them in a safe place also write your goals dreams and things youre grateful for 4) listen to happy or classical music - proven to change brain chemistry 5) read about anger - its a message that something is wrong change what you can and accept what you cannot 6) be really compassionate to yourself no judging 7) learn meditation - online is fine hope these help!,0

just shy i use to hate people saying that to mei dont take medication this is my own choice my life is strict its very scheduled and and i have a psychologist i have regular sleep hours very important but what has helped me massively is my gym workouts i work out alot could you see a psychologist ?,1
i am on it too and works how and again but have anxiety attack today couldnt even go out,0
how long have you been on it? is it possible that you need a medication adjustment? i found i was worse on the higher doses sertraline than the lower ones at 50 i was ok but anxiety wasnt controlled was upped to 100 and had multiple panic attacks a day generally unwell hang in there medication can be frustrating ive been messing with mine for a year and finally have an apt with a new dr for evaluation,1
i find anxiety to be debilitating controlling & terrorizing all at the same time ☹️☹️,1
it usually "blows"through high blood pressure or bleeding ulcers better to to find "relaxation response" or a "funny movie" ,1
take your husband to your doctor when you next go if he`s a decent doctor he should make him perfectly aware of how serious an illness this is that is nothing to be ashamed,1
thats shameful of yr hubby to speak to you this way love to you ,0
my ex husband is a narcissistwhen i confront him of every day issues like getting health insurance for our baby when i found out i was highly pregnant he said we would pay cash when and if needed to i then realized he did not want children i spent 2010 working with him to make our future 2013 married him2014 gave birth 2015 divorce due to my ex being a narcissist im recovering from depression/anxiety due to me giving up my life for my ex husband who is all about himself he has nothing to do with our child unless its court ordered it may be himand not you,0
thats a crock! shame on him! he is not helping you,1
i suffer from depression alsoi have anxiety pills with me all the timewe i take them whenever i need them apparently your husband doesnt understand how it works and his words were harsh even though we know your not a junkiei would have said to him"yea im a junkieso what" and turn around and leave the room dont let it get to you! dont let it keep going around and around in your brain take some deep breathslet it go! and pray to god for answers,0
i lost my job due to my mental health so my husband walked out he said i was a lazy sponger he doesnt understand what it is to feel so hopeless but i suppose i only have myself to worry about now,0
probably sounds really dumb of me butare there classes where the family members can go and learn about it? so they can educate themselves a bit personally if i was the family member and had a mentally ill loved one id go to book stores libraries the internet and educate myself on my loved ones mental illness study and write things down when you truly love someone youd do anything to help them feel at ease you would love them support them listen to them and they will love you back love both ways if someone loves you they wouldnt act this way im so frustrated about them not wanting to educate themselves or find a book or something so so many dont bother thats not love i have full blown panic/anxiety attacks and take my meds to calm me down i guess im a "junkie" too a junkie is someone who is addicted or dependent on drugs or meds and cant stop sorry this has happened darling,0
he needs to realize the difference between maintaining mental illness with meds and a junkie someone that is mentally ill wants to get better so they can maintain a quality of life and be as "normal" as possible and medication can help them do that while a junkie takes pills and meds to help them avoid dealing with life you sought help and ate getting more help that doesnt happen for someone that is faking it im wondering if you talk to your doctor about maybe explaining things to him he needs to realize that you need his understanding and support and negativity wont help you,1
hi i was put on zoloft 300mgs i feel they dont work that much but everyone is different & i do have alot of stress in my life atm which doesnt help,1
depends on your diagnosis im diagnosed bipolar 2 and mixed features zoloft made me very irritable and brought out the rage of my bipolar my psychiatrist said zoloft for bipolar is a bad idea because itll flip you into a manic episode (which it did),0
you mentioned bad thoughts many people with bipolar disorder have psychosis at one time or another during their life they put you on an anti-psychotic medication (usually temporarily) even though it feels embarrassing taking an anti-psychotic medication it takes away the bad thoughts & made me act normal again i realized the bad thoughts werent caused from my depression although it did make my depression worse the underlying cause was psychosis its hard for bipolar people to keep regular sleep schedules lack of sleep can bring on psychosis,1
ive take ablify along with zoloft ive bern on zoloft about 18 mths and had no probe previous to that i was on effexor and before that many others started ablify due to paranoia compulsive self harming thoughts/ behaviour,1
my 13 y o is on that combo and it works for her bp and anxiety - shes been on it for many years - she was also a zoloft baby - as i took zoloft throughout my pregnancy bc back then they deemed it safe - same with my son - he was a zoloft baby too and he has been on zoloft now for his depression anxiety for almost a year :(,1
if ur bipolarnot a good med imo my daughter was recently prescribed it and she went into psychosisit was awful at just 25mgsshe had horrible withdrawals from zoloft too which surprised me because she was only on it for 2 weeks at the lowest dose,0
i worked in mental health care for 10 years and was very good at my job but between mental illness job stress and events in my life i was rendered a mess that can barely take care of himself yet alone others im disabled now all i can advise is to get a support network of friends and family and get meds and therapy and try to work through this i havent lost hope that i will get back to where i used to be,0
its not your fault and you arent "stupid" it is not your fault i work in an incredibly busy pharmacy and i know it doesnt come close to the stress of nursing but i managed to force them into scheduling me only part time and at night its okay to work with anxiety and bipolar i have bipolar 1 and ptsd and anxiety disorder they say that working with these chronic conditions is how we can get through them theyre never going to go away and that isnt our fault granted i dont do anything at all anything on my days off i just said alot of words but the real thing i want to say is it is not your fault [heart],0
anxiety is a monster not sure what you do about it as i never found the answer and no one ever seemed interested in treating that aspect of my illness; they only wanted to focus on and treat the depression i wish you the best,1
i feel that way alot but im sure my job is half as demanding as being a nurse people dont understand what it takes to get out of bed get in the car  get even to the edge of the driveway the stress and anxiety the constant thinking going on in our heads negativity and shaming constantly i understand everything you think  everything you feel you are not alone i wish i could stand up and say i cannot work if they only knew how i feel every day great job standing up for yourself  you are awesome,0
yes and like you i feel so stupid for allowing myself to get in such a state of panic and dread around situations that other people find easy ive lost jobs and interviews due to this in past and even socially i find it hard there are many techniques but it isnt easy to just suddenly become confident smiley individual take small steps,0
sounds like anxiety,1
such a fear of medication screw ups ha cant even think of the right name for it smh bottom line is i couldnt live with hurting or worse killing someone!,0
yes i was a janitor at my kids school it slowly changed into a para too then one of elementary schools closed and became a special education building they wanted me to stay and have a couple of "goffers" to teach daily living skills ok no prob the starting of it was ok until it morphed into 3-4 classrooms of 30-40 spec ed high schoolers! the panic set in i dont have the skills or training for this other than my own two! the sit down plan did it! come to find out one of the young men that was a "goffer" had a heart condition too and should have never been doing some of the things we were doing!!(iep wasnt shown to me until the sit down) and his daily para was there pushing!!!! that was it i was done! no way i could have lived w/myself had something happened to him! i walked away from the school systems miss the kids but not the stress or worry! i have not worked in several yrs,0
yes it happened to me i always worked full time two jobs single mom of the year and then like a strike of lighteningit was like the flood gates opened and my whole life fell into my lap at once i have bipolar 1 ptsd anxiety and borderline personality disorder i started medicines that seemed to help then i lost my jobs because of my irrational behavior and tardiness that was last june i literally went from being wonder woman to a shell of wonder woman i still want all those things job money social life friends and family but im crippled with irrational fears and anxieties i stay home with my kids now i try to stay busy so i dont feel so worthless i craft i force myself to make 1 phone call a day so that im not completely alone i try to make the best whats right here in my comfort zone,0
i cry over anything and everything i think sometimes that i am way too emotional but then people who dont show any emotion kind of scare me!,0
interesting point before i got treated i would list all the things weighing on or annoying me what i learned was that it was hormonal and brain chemistry caused i dont discuss my chronic anxiety or depression with most people i have a therapist to help me with that i do discuss my pain and exhaustion due to fibro because that disables me more visibly,1
if youre struggling and your people are just sitting there watching you struggle theyre not your people so be it,0
caregivers must be well in order to properly look after their loved ones seek the treatment you need and though it may be hard cast aside any guilt for seeking treatment because there should be none you dont need your familys consent or their approval to seek treatment forcing yourself to suck it up may make things worse in the long run cant offer people something to drink if your pitcher is empty  do what you have to do for yourself for your well-being and for your future,1
pray ask god come into your life its satan thats doing ths to u hes giving u a horrible life god will heal what satan scumbags damaged do it now you will have peace love contentment keepin u in prayer xox,0
go back to the hospital seems like everyone is focused on their well being you should do the same its not being selfish or anything of that nature but how do they expect you to tend to your mom if youre unstable how do you think that youre able to so? my family puts pressure on me knowing im not doing very well almost like they tend to forget at times i honestly feel they dont care about anything but what they need or want and then i end up relapsing i have learned how to distance myself from those type people to prevent having any setbacks every situation is different but if youre feeling that bad i pray you find it in you to go seek help immediately!!! god bless you and i hope all turns out well!,0
exactly i fear not being on meds it took many many years to find the right ones but now i know how good i can be with the help of my meds and counseling i never ever want to go back to depression,1
i take zoloft i was told by my doctor not to stop even though i have horrible migraines i feel tired sleepy i dont see the energy she said id have i dont like this medication and i do want to stop taking it,0
i have depression and anxiety but okay? i choose to deal with mine naturally medication isnt a solution for everyone was my point and some things are better managed by vitamins exercise and whole foods,1
i was really bad about not taking my meds after i start feeling better and every single time  weeks or months later i crash and burn for the past 3 months i have been taking me meds everyday like prescribed and i havent crashed and i feel "normal"  what i think everyone else feels like i knew better than to stop taking them i knew what would happen i dont know why i would do it there are side effects of the meds but i would rather deal with side effects than live without the medication and depression anxiety and mood swings,1
listen everyone is different how they are with things with bi-polar for genuine then you must take medication to stop this horrid horrid feelings and panic attacks you get if you do not take them ive had the lot nightmares every night and disorientation when i never had meds deep depression horrendous anxiety but when i found the right meds i was feeling great so dont start throwing these meds away its dangerous if you feel ok without meds well you havent got genuine bi-polar or any genuine mental illness i followed what my psychiatrist said and never looked back,1
i take all my meds as prescribed sure they dont cure me however they do stablize my moods i am productive almost every day i still have days where i dont want to get out of bed other days i talk to fast or get irritable for the most part my days are good i dont think my meds are a miracle cure they juts enhance my ability to enjoy life,0
medication doesnt feel fine medication makes you want to go get a rope and go out the back yard its better to live with your insanity and not want to breathe & living with your demons is the lesser evil even though both are misery lol ,0
had to breath slow and steady all day anxiety all day,0
and ofcourse islam islam has a bad influence all those terror attacks are credited to muslims with a mental disorder,1
anxiety and depression is a killer,1
oh my gosh that is scary wish i could start sleeping regularly,1
i feel the same way about my anxiety sometimes i cant explain why im feeling anxious because i dont know why,0
in my dreams i cant ever read the chalk board writing its like its shorthand it makes me soooo depressed and i fall into a deeper depression i wake up crying and shaking and i pick up something and read and feel better,0
i sorry you have been suffering you probably have bipolar 3 where you dont see thing  you have extremely high where your funtional then you have a drop a low of a period of depression it goes up and then it goes down you need to be on a ant- depressant for a period of time enough time for it to work  we as a society take ton of meds but when it comes to mental illness we refuse to take anything bc your afraid it will make you look weak or be judged the all person by that is judging is our self bc that what are mental illness does to us your fine  you will feel better soon our brain tricks us constantlyi had clinical depression anxiety ptsd bipolar 3 obsessive complsive desorder  for years i lied to my self and refused the help because i had my highs but we i got therapy meds and tried everything to read up on the illness i began to be consistent  i get accupunture and  massagetherapy emdrmedsi workouttake vitaminjucice coffee enamas saunabath  with mental illness there is abnormal inflammation in the brian so i take omega coconut oilgingerwhite willow bark i cover my head while i take a bath to warm up my head like with a beany i meditate i tell people i have a mental illness and the dont believe it bc i so funtional dont be scared of it just try to find stuff that helps u i make art and pottery for me creating things is an outlet maybe try a new hobby i not a doctor but i hope my suggestion helped,1
im embarrassed to admit this on mothers day i fell asleep (dont even recall lying down) i didnt wake up till 8:45 pm we were supposed to have dinner etc i missed all of it nor did i call until i woke at 8:45 the worst part is that im 40 years old i absolutely felt like crap possibly ask your mom if she could teach your daughter to do these things i was raised by a single mom as well it never occurred to my brothers to get my mom a card & gift once i took them out shopping for her they got the hang of it i do feel for you though it must really hurt to not even get a 99 cent card on mothers day:-(,0
the most awful feeling is being estranged from your children and when youre bpd/ptsd/anxiety/ocd/adhd etc that feeling without your family is magnified by 100x its the worst feeling in the world youre not selfish you just feel more than others take your daughter to dinner- tell her happy mothers day- without you; she wouldnt be here tell her you love her and just enjoy the moment- doesnt matter what day it is youre still m❤m remember: just as you suffer from these debilitating titles so do our children- they are hurt by our hurt and relationships are affected by the slightest be patient and selfless time is on your side happy mothers day!,0
no i felt the same way yesterday no acknowledgement no gift nothing it was a horrible day,0
i almost forgot it was mothers day personally i have no relationship with my own mother and my youngest son is entering his last week of his freshman year of high school my horse gashed his forehead open my a&p class started i had served on a major criminal case jury the week before last my oldest totally took over everything for me while i was stuck at a courtroom for 12+ hours a day so we all forgot until my dad reminded me saturday mothers day isnt a big deal to me my kids appreciate me every day of the year they have been known to give me fathers day cards too in the past because i am a single mom and play both rolls i dont hold one thoughtless moment against them much they are teenagers teenagers are notoriously selfish (its just how their brains are) doesnt mean she doesnt love you or appreciate you yes your mom could have done something but she didnt and why get upset about what could of would of should of? its really not worth the energy my ex never did crap for me on my birthday mothers day any holidays and i spent a lot of time being miserable and letting him ruin it we run into problems when we expect people to treat us the same way we treat them rather than accepting that people do the best that they can do even when its far from acceptable to us ive worked hard to learn how to not rely on others for my happiness,0
i am astonished by this conversation i have no children by birth but 3 grown adults for whom i have been a special "mom" i am acknowledged weekly with love and appreciation for the contributions and nurturing ive given through the past 10+ years i do not selfishly look for this it comes as a result of building and sustaining a strong relationship i have no "anxiety" over the issue whatsoever and personally feel you have blown this way out of perspective and are creating your own malcontent experience,0
its far from selfish hun its just the way youre feeling at the moment and something so small that possibly wouldnt bother you has become more prominent and its upsetting maybe have a little word with your mum as to how its made you feel im sure she didnt want to make you feel this way its good to talk hun xx,0
on my very first mothers day after years of infertility my husband never even got me a card my son is a teenager now and it still hurts i didnt suffer from anxiety or depression back then so i dont think youre being selfish at all its still hit or miss some years with hubbylast year nothing this year cards gifts and dinner its not about the gifts its about feeling loved and appreciated we all want to feel that regardless of our mental health,0
i dont think your being selfish ! maybe anxiety & over thinking too much about it  im not saying that in a nasty way to you  my kids are in their 20s & forgot mothers day too but ive never encouraged mothers day / fathers day etc just another day for me  xx,0
its true and i lost that when my mumma passed away been a year and a half of struggling alone with no support and it sux,0
im sorry its the things that bother us even though we feel like they shouldnt keeping a very detailed journal for your therapist will help more than anything its so hard to say what you want to in the short time you get it is a difficult challenge to do and when it happens the distress makes it hard to write or remember keep something on you at all times to document i wish you the best,0
i felt the same way up until last year my dad took me to a krav maga class and i learned how to defend myself the first time i had to hit the other womans padded bag i broke down in tears the instructor came over and encouraged me to hit and keep hitting i was sobbing the whole time but it really helped now i know where to hit an attacker what will bring him/her down quickly it was so empowering that im now able to leave the house i still get some anxiety when coming home late from work but i remember what they taught me muscle memory and to immediately react if attacked,0
i do this its like i have a bubble around me that shrinks what you need is a distraction the fear isnt really your environment its in your head,1
i moved to portugal and for the first year i was too scared to go out alone as i didnt speak portuguese now i can so feel much better im so sorry youre having this problem but i can relate for years i was afraid of the night because thats when our grandfather would get drunk and chaos reigned i was also afraid of teenaged boys for years due to harassment youre doing the right thing by talking about your fear i hope you will be able to share with your dr hugs,0
taking what youve posted on this thread already should give your dr or therapist enough information to be able to begin a treatment plan to help you overcome your fears of being alone do you think you could possibly have a deep seated fear of abandonment? that was a disorder i had to deal with because of issues that stemmed from my childhood when my parents divorced no matter which one of them was taking care of methe other one was absent in my lifethis was what set me up to feel abandoned when i was left alone in my adult life with the right treatment plan medication & learning how to cope i was able to overcome those desperate feelings of abandonment,0
as others have suggested if you feel uncomfortable verbalising things then write it down infact what you have posted is exactly what you should show your dr so that they can make a proper diagnosis or refer to specialist etc,0
idk but try searching about paranoid personality disorder and maybe when you know more about it you can comfortably discuss it to your doctor or therapist,1
i suggest you write down everything thats going on everything that scares you how you feel better copy paste what you just posted and hand it to your doctor he has to know so that he can help you with the right medication it works for me i have problems talking and i cant talk on the phone neither let your feelings flow on the paper it will work take care,1
if the doctor and therapist dont know they cant help please let them know my son can be alone but cant sleep in his room upstairs he is 34 he sleeps on the couch to be nearer to us but we can go overnight about twice a year and he says he isnt scared has 2 dogs that is what helps him,0
i did this too writing everything i was experiencing when i went to a psychiatrist the first time i hate meds but i have a lot of things wrong there are some that are out there and it would ease the anxiety i think after that your behavioral therapy would be easier that is my opinion like everyone seems to be saying you need to open up to your psychiatrist or youre not going to get the right help youve suffered enough! tell him everything and how it makes you feel thoughts and prayers,0
you probably have severe anxiety and anxiety can come form anything high stress  or some childhood trama if therapy is going to work you need to be honest with your therapist in order for them to help you you need to be able to except there is a problem in order for you to address it and get some coping strategies also there lot of defrient anxiety med  tracking trigger will make you feel more in control tell your family even as silly as you think it is they will support you and cope better try exercising an order to burn off extra energy from your body be kind with your self one step at a time,1
use this religiously it can be bought at wal-mart cvs walgreens this little bottle is about 6 bucks  i bit mine at walgreens because its bigger i use it every time i shower where my hair grows (i can shave now) and *embarrassing * under my fat roll no more sores,1

ive gained 30 lbs due to mental fog and meds i dropped lyrica as it made me angry and fat i totally get what youre feeling im ashamed of my body too its depressing! hugs,0
yes i am going through this i have gained 100 pounds in just a few months from medications that make me hungry and depression because the pills arent helping me so i dont care what i eat im trying to get control and trying different meds thats one reason mental health problems suck so many drugs they put you on then there are new side effects and its just a never ending circle ive also developed poly neuropathy im sad i let my body go but depression makes you not care you will eventually find something that has less side effects dont be upset about your weight it will come off please stay positive about yourself ,1

i just love when people say you have to be strongum let me see you live with this illness work raise kids alone deal with everyday life struggles cry your eyes out almost on a daily endure tremendous emotional pain that gets so bad it becomes physicaland still smile never tell a survivor of mental illness they need to be strongonly the strong can keep going and never give up no matter how much theyve gone through people live their lives trying to avoid feeling uncomfortable or only understand grieving when they lose a loved one or get divorced or any life tragedy people with mental illness get to know what that pain feels like alreadyand we still are trying to survive warriors is what we areand to be a warrior and survive this illness takes more strength than most can even wrap their mind around,0
ive got bad anxiety problems im glad i have my girl she may not understand but shes always there for me ❤,0
4-7-8 breathing technique shown to reduce anxiety by 65% ,1
i use mindfulness it has been a godsend there are plenty of resources on the internet explaining what it is and what to do and there are even apps for your phone a simple eg is colouring it helps you focus on one thing so you change your mindset like i said its a simple example its something you need to practice everyday so you are ready when your anxiety starts to take hold take care,1
if you have a generalized anxiety disorder it might not be possible to come up with a reason for the anxiety or anxiety attack- i usually lose my hearing and most of my sight in a panic attack and i find the take an ice cube in each hand and squeeze method to be very effective my psychologist told me about it - just hold an ice cube in each hand tightly and it really helps i think it cools you while slowing something down and distracts your mind with the sensation once i start to come back down to earth i start repeating to myself you are here you are safe and push your feet into the floor and feel the sensation look around and notice things to remind you that you are safe in a safe place i use these they are simple and they work for helping me gain back my faculties especially,1
i just learned this in order to identify your anxiety you have to know what feeling your having and then figure out what feeling made you have that one example: had a great day found out both my teens had plans today i immediately went from happy to sad to angry to self destruct mode and in reality i was just truly hurt im told its a learned behavior which still i dont know from where i can see why i believe it comes from a mix of being abused and people being mean and eventually being taken advantage of its very frustrating i know and it just plane sux!!!! but if your able to do that it will help took me about 5 hours to see that and a lot of talking and distracting myself will i remember for next time? i hope so hope this helps somewhat!! best of luck!!,0
deep breathing is the absolute best way to handle anxiety take a deep breath in through your mouth hold for 5 seconds then release slowly as if you are blowing through a straw repeat multiple times you should also look up progressive muscle relaxation its a very useful tool where you tighten parts of your body and release sounds weird but is very credible and works,1
i have shared this words so many times ill share it again if an incurable disease has invaded your life refuse to let it touch your spirit your body can be severely afflicted and you have a great struggle but if you keep trusting gods love your spirit will remain strong,0
omg! the struggle is real,0
i no the feeling its horrible,0
your partner is insensitive and causes you more stress than needed  i was in some unhealthy 6year shit i fuckin dipped no your worth,1
many people (including me) suffer from this and its apparently part of anxiety i googled for it and a lot of links came up i personally looked at them as biochemical errors and did not worry about them however i did seek and continue treatment for anxiety which made my life so much more pleasant others cannot see your thoughts but i think you are suffering greatly from this problem and its totally desirable and worth seeking professional help you are not strange youre perfectly human!,0
hello no i get more anxiety on this medication,1
hehecharlie brown actually calms my anxietyiguess he worries for me,1
if i dont have something to worry about my mind will definitely find something more to obsess about and then some,1
there is light at the end of the tunnel its a struggle but worth it ask your doctor to change your meds i am on venlafaxine and stresam and all i can do is praise this wonderful combination also meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy worked for me too perhaps try exercising too i took up golf a great tiring walk with a purpose good luck remember you have people who love you,1
you are not alone ive had some very dark lows myself i have c-ptsd with anxiety major depressive disorder and repressed memories ive been to that dark numb place where everything that could harm you reminds you of how much easier it would be but dont give up it may be that you are on a medication that doesnt work well for you or the dosing could be incorrect i went through a dark period for weeks feeling like i just wanted to end it all i was numb and felt empty i didnt have any real good support around i finally got back to my doctor who adjusted my medication and a few weeks later i started to feel better it wasnt perfect fast and believe me i still have really bad days but you are not alone i am here if you ever need to talk,0
please feel free to express and even if you dont want to just dont do it pretending everything is okay is tough not only tough i think its just disgusting so stop it its you and only you who knows how u feel what kind of chaos going on in ur mind i had spent almost 2 years in bed just like doing nothing at that time only thought i had was as if am gonna pass away soon anytime hated everyone who tried to symptahize or help me then there came something and i really dont know where it came from i mean the confidence that i can be normal again will smile again and it took years to that nothing is permanent you are in same situtaion like me the soon you want to get out of this shit the worse it gets so be patient medicines do work but it takes time meanwhile you better quit seeing normal people do not loose hope after all we all fall down and its not our fault you just need to stop worrying about everything not only your illness but everything in ur life,0
iv been there been on citalapram for years also got propananol for panic attacks i often wish i could have a heartache or something to get help its hard to get ppl to understand how it feels i struggle with feelings about selfharm and suicide when im low but there is another side i try my hardest to tell myself tomorrow could be better or the next day fight it take care of yourself even if you have to be selfish the medication might help but 4 wks is probably not going to be long enough to notice any improvement i also find writing things down gets it out you can read it later and see if you still feel the same or just bin it xxx,0
i have never admitted it before to a group i suffer every day i was diagnosed with "manic depression" back in 1994 now they say its a bipolar disorder ive got? idk what the hell i "have" but it is hard as hell to go through each day i was a cutter i did the suicide attempts and gained a bad liver and kidneys from it ive smoked weed and it helped but i would slip into these funks and it is so hard to get through them especially when im full of fear shame and self loathing during these times it is so hard to let people see me that way ive been struggling pretty badly today thats why i happened on here its a little easier knowing im not alone everyone who posted here reminds me of myself in one way or another keeping focused on the small positives helps sometimes i hope you find strength and hope each day in little and large things i always have to remind myself that i have control over my life thank you for sharing your story i understand how hard that probably was and how brave you are for reaching out idk about everyone else on here but when my loved ones watch me going through my episodes i just wanna hide or disappear sending hope and good vibes,0
yeah i dont want the world outside to exist sometimes like im trapped in my own head its hard to explain but 2 of my kids are still young & i find myself setting them up with activities to keep them busy and hiding in the shower stall crying because im so depressed and i cant snap out of it the doctors think i may have an ocd too and that feed my anxiety during my episodes the feelings of no control add to the flames of depression and i spiral out of control other days it turns me listless those days i find someone to take care of the kids so they arent contaminated by me sometimes just seeing people happy makes me depressed cause even when im happy i dont feel happy or it doesnt last sigh thank you for sharing a part of ur world it really really helps to know that others understand me even if my own family and support group dont truly understand my struggle ♡,0
i agree with so much of what you are sayingi was diagnosed bipolar 20years ago now l have far greater problems with depression than maniastruggle to get up every day and totally hide away wont answer the ph or door push everyone away hate been seen wont reach out or go to dr just inside trying to distract myself with books puzzles film and feeling totally worthless,0
its going to get better your doing everything you can right now  your going in the right directioni felt the same like you  i actually had 3 sucides and i cam back from all of them i happy now i got treat with the same meds your taking if there not working ask for something eles if you dont do anything all day it ok you are doing enough by surviving try baths or massage i could not even leave my house bc of my anxiety i pretended for a long time to be fine  therapy and meditation combo helped,1
take a deep breath i have experienced everything you have mentioned at one time or another make sure you stay in close contact with your dr i lived in constant fear that tomorrow would bring something that would cause me to give up nights are hard for me so i made me tell myself "itll all be better in the morning" i know it will never be better but concentrating on only making it till morning seems to be manageable,0
that you are reaching out to us is amazingits not that caring isnt in you its just that everything in you is fighting to survive and youre exhaustedjust as this is terrifying for you ist is for those who love you too so use what you have left to not pull away from them going into hosp as a voluntary patient may be you answeryou can leave anytime it feels wrong and if it does work you will at last be able to let go and healallow any med 10 days then change if not workingbut ask for the side effects beacause we can be allergic and need to come off as fast as possiblei believe you can heal :-):-):-):-):-),0
ive been living with bipolar disorder chronic depression extreme anxiety adhd insomnia ocd bpd ptsd and self harm since i was 5 i am now about to turn 34 i have no memories of a "normal" life because i was born this way and it showed up early in my life i have been on every medication i have had unsuccessful ect i have been hospitalized a few times and seen countless therapists and psychiatrists the side effects of meds have almost driven me insane i used to be embarrassed about my mental illnesses but am trying to become and advocate for it i am resistant to all treatments i havent found much of anything that helps but i have seen people get help and i have seen people be able to cope with it! be as honest as you can with the friends and family you do have i have been torn down by so many people i love but i am choosing to be a warrior and fight this damn battle until one of us is dead! its scary cause even as i write this i am suicidal and have a razor in my lap ready to make some more scars i know that sounded not hopefully but its meant to show i have a long way to go but look how far i have come!!! everyday is different and a struggle and honestly just plain hell panic attacks always feel like your dying no matter how many you have! medications can be helpful you just need to find the right combo for you specifically its a challenge but hang in there see your psychiatrist regularly and keep a journal of how you feel everyday not just oh good or bad rate your anxiety from 1-10 and your depression etc then you can see what maybe is working and maybe what is not see a therapist often especially in the beginning talk about any and everything no matter how dumb or insignificant or embarrassing it might be you can learn some coping skills to help aid the meds i believe in you! you can do this! if i can you can! it seems to me the people with mental illnesses are strong they just need to find that strength within them!! hang in there recovery is a process not and event!,0
and you know what every morning i wake up after 15 mins my vision gets terribly disturbed i litreally see things moving where actually there is no movement at all but the only thing i know is one day it will be free of this shit,0
i know as impossible as it may seem right now these feelings/thoughts will not last forever dont give up as hard as it is to feel this miserable you have to take it one day at a time hang on to one thing you have to live for for me it was my kids even though i truly believed with everything in me that they would be better off without me the pain they would live with kept me breathing never give up ,0
im sorry you are going through so much turmoil i know it is awful it is definitely worth getting better you can start enjoying g things again and get a regular sleep schedule it will aso help with your desire to self harm that doesnt do any body any good if i were you i would go ahead and go to the hospital it really does help there is nothing to be afraid of or ashamed of the help is there for you take it before its too late,1

ive gained 20lbs i absoutely hate it ive recently been going to the gym and trying to eat healthier sometimes i think i look okay im only 410 but then sometimes i can really see the weight its frusterating i know i need the medication to help with my anxiety and depression which it has but its difficult sometimes looking in the mirror,0
exactly there are times i will worry about my weight but i have to take other things into consideration i will work out like crazy and lose twenty pounds at the most and plateau ive just accepted it,1
i replace breakfast and lunch with diet shakes and im losing small amounts of weight not a great deal its really hard,0
i lost 180 lbs after my divorce i lost 30 lbs and 150 lb man when i became happy again i gained 30 lbs back not sure if its the meds but it is horrible,0
it has for me ive had a falloff because change of meds for anxiety re stepping back onto it before i managed to lose 15kg just by controlling my calories i am back where i started however i know its possible using fitness pal to track all you eat is essential and helpful also big motivator to curb snacking on high calorie foods :),1
im fine hun honest dont worry babes xx,0
girl i just got out of a marriage with someone that didnt get my anxiety at all it was hard but i left i would rather be by myself and wait for the true person that is going to love and accept me for me anxiety and depression and all and not going to get mad in the middle of the night because i need to breathe and need help because there is someone out there like that being alone and figuring out how to love myself has been such a great journey know your worth beautiful dont accept less than bullshit,0
im so sorry to hear that its horrible to be in that situation hopefully you found something to help if not writing do you draw? or something else? sometimes the distraction is the best thing for coping in the immediate if hes usually like this might be time to move on trust me when i said i made the jump and you dont need someone to survive you are strong in yourself and if youre worried about being lonely if youve got the time and resources maybe consider a pet? my cat is my saviour when im not doing well she knows and comes and gives me cuddles also your parents have no right telling you that you have to fix things when its causing you severe distress to be with him they should support you making the best decisions for you!,0
sometimes all a person can do is battle with suicide on a minute by minute bases with each passing minute there is hope within that help my be foundits lack of hope that kills its such a disgrace that so many service personnel are used to defend the country they love and sent to do what the political elite have not the stomach for but on their return when they suffer with so much trauma physically and mentally they are now of no further use to such political elite they find themselves discarded like one puts out the trashworthless and throw away  a real democratic society is judged by how it treats is disabled and vulnerable i guess a lot of so called democratic societies should really now start to look at how the genuinely really do treat their citizens in time of need,1
if you struggled with voices illusions suicide and huge stages of depression you would do a lot of blow drinking and drugs to have a little sunshine in your life too bipolar sucks live strong,0
i did sober 4 years its still a struggle tip find other ways not to self medicate i stick close to the program pray meditate and have professional help it works mostly,1
marijuana speed (amphetamine) and alcohol have always been my struggle drugs are old issues now but i need to consciously make the decision everyday not to drink,0
im part of the 60% but over a year sober now! the real struggle for me tends to be finding ways other than drinking to cope with mental illness ,0
all of those saying they dont struggle are the 40%,0
i believe this is true because substance abuse comes in all kinds of forms its not just drugs it can be tobacco shopping gambling drinking porno anything a person can turn into an addiction to try to mask the pain of this diseaseand i believe bi polar disease goes hand in hand with stress our society over taxes our bodies with more stress than ever before,0
i dont struggle,0
that depends are you part of the 60 percent that are likely to use drugs or the 40 percent that dont have substance issues? note the terms " expected to struggle " just because you have the cravings doesnt mean you give in to them it just means you struggle with them you pious sanctimonious self righteous little prick,0
i struggled for 24 yrs with substance abuse  i clean now 7  10 yrs clean,0
thank you paul its been a true struggle after i quite i was diagnosed bipolar 2,0
hyper-mania would be referred to as just mania mania is considered worse than hypomania as the severity of paranoid delusions hallucinations etc are much worse in my personal opinion that are both just as bad hypomania is consistent with bp2 which is harder to diagnose as the milder symptoms get dismissed or overlooked,0
i have had unwanted thoughts in the past and found them disturbing id read that they can be due to nutritional impoverishment or emotional abuse ill go check it out online and report back remember always that you are part of humanity and your experience is never unique many have similar experiences hugs,0
bless you i used to be high flying multi tasking superwoman now i get overwhelmed with too much work but you are young and need to stick at this so personally i would take my medication and i would listen to some motivational getting up for a positive day guided meditation i would listen to another one at lunch or break time and then another relaxing sleep talk down at night good luck i love my work again now but am just not as speedy as i used to be good luck and dont let it beat youxx,1
im struggling myself,0
i have been forced to take time off work sick for up to a yr at a time due to my bipolar type 2 im bk at work now but some days i get going no problems other days i battle with myself to get out of bed i struggle to keep going and working can be so hard and drain me but if i didnt force myself to go to work id be stuck at home feeling worse its hard but keep fighting ❤,0
due to my schizo effective and bi polar i havent been able to hold a job for over 10 years it makes me feel horrible like why cant i be a normal functioning adult and mom at the same time it took a long time and the people who love me and the greatest man i met two years ago to help me realize that i may not be able to work like everyone else but i do a damn good job being a mom and taking care of so much more thats way more important than being a "normal " adult and holding a full time job i got a job only working 3 hours a week and had a panic attack over that but im slowly working on getting there and its helping youll get there too but first thing comes first and that is you if one thing ive learned is you gotta take care of you first i still struggle with that but im getting there and you will too hugs,0
i struggled with the same kind of thing whether it was school or work i eventually ended up going on ssi,0
i dont know if i have bipolar 2 but i have been struggling with depression and low self-esteem for a long time depression and anger cost me a job i only had for two weeks back in 2014,1
up until the last 3 yrs i had worked full time as a primary teacher then i had 2 yrs when i took a significant chunk of time off due to this last year i started full time and had an acute episode in april and havent been back full time since i tried part time but this yr 2 days a week but have yet to have success have been given till the middle of the year on sickness and will go from there it has been horrendous i have so much guilt from not being able to contribute to the family income but i cant teach if im not even in my own body lol,0
totally get it depression and anxiety have always been constants in my young adult life i had a mental breakdown back in december and i have been out of work ever since it wasnt until january that i was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder the mere thought of going back to where i worked brings on a panic attack i constantly obsessed over what my coworkers thought of and were saying about me behind my back i always worry about being good enough suicidal thoughts plague my life and i have been hospitalized once for them there are times where i just want to wave the proverbial white flag and not wake up i have a really difficult compartmentalizing and dealing with stressors both positive and negative sometimes i get so overwhelmed that all i can do is cry endlessly most days i feel like a failure and a burden im only 27 and i am currently looking into disability options,0
i find my bipolar 2 is kind of cyclical i can be very high functioning or unable to cope at all did the student/job/kids/exercise for a couple of years and then after a life change shifted back into bad habits and then a depressive episode where i cant cope again just take it easy on yourself the transition from student to employee might of set you off so practice as much self care and eliminate as much stress as you can im pregnant so was going off of work this year anyway and could use that as an excuse with my employer and keep my good reference without that circumstance though i would have chosen to focus on another area of my life to cut out some stress you made it through school! you will transition and have a great career once you get through this depressive part of your cycle!,1
ive been told by my doctor i am "unfit to work impossible at this time" house bound a year and 3 months wont step outside at all i freak out severe depression severe anxiety panic disorder borderline pd avoidant pd bipolar 1 cerebral palsy poor balance i keep busy by doing chores and keeping my house spotless and i sleep my life away im 29,1
jennifer ager okay so idk if its okay to tag you in but i immediately thought of you & im super fucking sorry if this upsets or offends or affects you negatively,0
i am bipolar 2 ptsd add anxiety and depression i take lamictal 100mg and adderall 20mg a day ive been on lamictal since i was 16 and ive never had a problem with it i actually like it cause im not on a super high dose so i can still function the adderall is new but the two together im ok with i use to be on zoloft with my lamictal and that combo worked as well,1

im pretty scared up but some i cover others i dont,0
i disagree hannah nicole lamberth their name includes biopolar which does not if you say lead to self harm conversely depression and anxiety might not all thank goodness as the group says suffer the same but please show support and sympathy if not empathy for those sufferring bipolar/depression/anxiety open page says it all they are an open page i cannot comprehend all thses illnesses but as a carer any information is helpful just as a person too i have no idea who i will meet or what i may become,1
my bad when it said "bipolar/depression/anxiety" i assumed it meant all that comes will the illness not everything everyone else brings to every other illness clearly this is an all illness page and seems its doesnt more then support these bad vices ,1
afraid thats mental illness for you a right sod!!,1
not me im afraid! been waiting 10 months for my appointment! not a new fangled mental health issue!!!!! where did that phrase suddenly appear from! it would seem everyone has a mental health problem! does anyone know the cause of this supposed problem! would be interested to know! what nonsense best wishes,0
thank you brenton gandy i dont ever want to be back where i was before my diagnosis when my doctor told me i have depression and anxiety i got with my family ( kids and husband ) to figure out an action plan  when my son was diagnosed a year ago with bipolar and syncophenia we put in an action plan for him as well  he is almost 22 ,1
thanks for the share never feel ashamed to be doing what is best for you and know you will win the battle,0

i can speak for only myself i dont understand what its like to be blind so i fear blindness i dont understand what its like to be deaf so i fear deafness what i dont understand i fear or learn to hate or ignore mental irregularities are the scariest of all maladies and the least understood i know how to help a blind person i know how to help a deaf person i havent the foggiest idea how to help a mentally ill person thats scary,0
its just pure ignorance they judge far too much they would have to go through it only then would they realise how cruel they have been to people suffering from a mental illnessive been suffering from depression for many years and yes ive tried to end my life several times im not ashamed of myself for being mentally ill but what has shocked me and deeply hurt me is that some people have turned their back on me yet ive always been there for them,0
some have supportive families i am one that does not i have 4 chikdren and of the four only 2 speak to me and tney are unable to helpme in any way the other two well one is an addict and the older is embarrased of me as her mother i was forced tolive with my oldet sister this past feb and ahe just dont understand what is going on with me and has no interest in learning she is verbally abusive and i feel very enslaved in her home im not allowed to have a bad day and its getting harder to fake being happy in her home my stress level is through the roof thank god for a good therapist and a even better psychiatrist that is steadily getting my meds increased to a threuaputic level my highlight daily is checking the mail awaiting word from social security to hear about my disabilty please pray that i get out of this situation soon!!! and god bless the writer of this post for coming out of your darkness!!!,0
i was very afraid to share this most people didnt know to the extreme i went or even that i was suffering i felt stigmatized but then i realized that there are so many out there that feel all alone like i did and a guiding hand or a shoulder to cry on could help i want to be that person it was therapeutic to share my story i cried in relief after i wrote this so much weight was lifted i pray others can have strength to keep fighting like the warriors they are,0
thanks for sharing your story i too am in that tunnel of darkness and confussion are you lds? i am and im so thankful for my blessing and church but i too keep pushing it away just from the fear anxiety and depression ive got myself on a horrible ride and i just cant get off good luck to all of us in peril,0
im crying i read this all the way through and i am where you were im scared and so alone and i cant ever stick with treatment because i cant keep up with copays everything is way out of control i hope there is a life after where i am i cried from start to finish and through comments,0
there is!! oh honey hang in there the road is hard but youre not alone im here even with whatever distance is between us i understand that spot of fear and unknowing i lived it for longer than i thought bearable you are so loved!! im not just saying this i really will be here for you message me if you need to vent let me hold your hand ,0
from the sounds of it she lives where i live and that will be no help they may possibly give her 1 dose of an anti anxiety med and send her out unless youve attempted suicide you get close to nothing they will call her med seeking and not help i was not suicidal but wanted to harm my childrenwent in immediately to be hospitalized they put me in a hall on a bed for 12 hours in er then sent me home because i was no danger to anyone and they couldnt waste a bed on me,1
i got free help at a state run facility while i was in utah i let slip that i was considering suicide a few years ago my mom saw and got scared she called my university health center they called the cops the cops paid me a visit and go me in not the preferred route but i got the meds i needed and the only thing i was required to do was to go to a group therapy session once a week didnt matter which one i just signed in and it counted i would highly suggest going to the nearest department of health and welfare and explaining the situation it may take you a few days it may not to see a doctor but theyll get you squared away do you have any family the kids can stay with in the area? it might be better for them; they wont get lost in the system you can see them whenever and they wont have to see you go through this theres also the possibility that during one of your drunken moments you hurt one by accident (i dunno if youre a mean drunk or not) you have to ask yourself do you really wat you two precious little kids to see you do this to yourself?,1
yes from all the comments here there are many things you can do check with your state to see what mental health services they offer most will have free meds for you and you can call their emergency number which is listed on the state website some states do use the first call for help line of 211 and hospitals will help you will not lose your kids as long as you show you are getting help social services may visit you in the hospital to see how you are doing but thats ok as long as you have a stable and safe clean home they wont take your child most of the time they dont even get involved unless someone calls to make a charge so dont worry,1
yep i am off my meds for 6 months miserable and not functional to go see a new dr with no insurance is ridiculous,1
u will not lose ur kids if u get help thats absurd if anything it shows ur taking care of urself i live in the states as wellive been hospitalized a few times and still have my childthere was never a threat that i wouldnt so please dont let that deter u from getting help,0
shes the one who said she was afraid her kid would be taken away so i assumed the dad is not there and from what was written it seems she can have the meds if she goes to an appointment but she cant afford to go to the appointment ie no car or no gas money which is why i suggested medical transport we have it in mi but i do t know about other states we also have your ride which is similar but you have to pay for it and its like 2 bucks,0
cut them off! it is what i had to do with my family they knew knew more than i hospitalized twice in my teens and no one would tell me what was wrong chose instead to demonize me for using drugs (really didnt want to see me without them) knew i was sick yet chose to judge me as a horrible person and dope fiend when i finally found out and that they know all along i cut them off i dont need them,0
i have excepted what i am my worst fears i see it in my kids and dont know what to do to help,1
colleen ill listen to you ive struggled for 20 years and girl ive survived you can too!!!,0
and! just to top it off ive lost all confidence in my gp who doesnt think im bipolar how can i express how i feel when i have to judge peoples response before i even open my mouth? well!! guess what?! i havent been able to " pull myself together " or "give my head a wobble" for over twenty years my world gets smaller n smaller every day but i go on fight struggling along with something no-one sees,0
their life is not my obligation i owe them no debt i will say what i will if what i say hurts you it is your obligation your duty to avoid me if you cant thats not on me that being said there are people that use it to garner attention or that do it as a fad i have met plenty,0
i always feel better after i have done it feels like a release of pressure not done it for a long time now i have my son to live for now i think those days are gone for me now,0
i exercise hard now instead but no for me my self harm (cutting and burning) was cathartic it was the only way i knew to reset my brain when it got overloaded with negative thoughts or i get stuck in my analytical loop it was how i started breathing again mine was also hidden on parts of the body that werent seenso yeah defo not for attentionbut i find working out or doing yoga actually helps the burn in my muscles helps in the same way :) but im not bipolar i suffer major depression and anxiety,1
i use to do this for those reasons rub the scares when i get upsetpromised i wouldnt do it anymore,1
alcohol and drugs will not only interfere with your antidepressant it is potentially very harmful to your unborn child to be honest your post come across as being a bit blase you need to take to take some responsibility depression and anxiety are not excuses for being aggressive towards other people has anyone mentioned anger management to try and find more positive ways to deal with your emotions and anger dont know how old you are but you sound fairly young are you really ready to be responsible for another human being? it doesnt sound as if you are particularly as you are doing things that could harm your baby seek support from your family friends or social services as you are going to need it however you also need to work towards better health it doesnt just happen by itself unfortunately wish you good luck,1
i would recommend to see therapist also maybe change your meds also energy drinks trigger anxiety and depressiondrinking with meds wrosen your simtons  it also think you might have bipolar 3 borderline personality disorder i am not a doctor or specialist​ but i been treated for over 12 years so i seen tons of therapist and take natural meditation as well as western medicineaccupunture works for me massage meditation i also stress levels cause change to your depression  not having a job allows more time to think try to keep busy if you can go for a walk take a bath juice fast my work too you can do 3days coconut oil reduces inflammation in the brain omega too helps the brain function better ginger  like i said this is all the stuff that has worked for me i am not a specialist try talking to a therapist sometimes when you voice the ideas you have in your brain it loses it power writing  pick up a new hobby till you get your job dont worry on the thing you cant control do small progressive thing around the house stuff you can actually control dont rominate about stuff thing eventually work them self out  i had 3 suicide and i was revived from all of them i happy i was i have done a ton of wonderful thing and picked up a ton of hobbies i getting to see my daughter grow up your son needs more then you think you cant replace a parent  one thing at a time  maybe the pressure of becoming a new parent might of triggered your depression but taking your life is not the way out you need to see your son grow i been through 2 divorces and i have survived there been dark times but i kept doing thing until i got better exercise has helped me alot also i wish you luck and i hope i have helped in any way having a mental illness is not the end of your life learn to except it and finding new ways to deal with it like any disease its not the end all your life is just beginning,1
sweetie get on different medication does your area offer anger management classes or anxiety classes,1
i know you are right i just worry about what they would think of me,0
what if your struggling and no one knows how to help when you wake up from a dead sleep feeling like youre drowning when ppl tell you how to fix your situation but you cant bring yourself to do it for what ever reason im lost i dont know what to do,0
you need to get help that deep of depression osnt something you can help him woth you need a pro but i agree with eveyone else if the threat is real you need to tell someone or get him to a hospital,1
i suffer from bipolar mdd ptsd psychosis and anxiety/panic disorder i suffered since age 13 i tried every medication out there i got so bad in october i did 16 rounds of ect it was a life changer for me then it wore off so we tried lithium and vraylar quetiapine and prozac and it brought me back up there is a treatment and medication out there it takes time to find it i researched alot myself and luckily my dr was listening to me and was willing to try new things keep trying never give up hope it took 25yrs to get to where i am at today,1
if hes threatening to take his life you need to call for help all threats of suicide should be taken seriously,1
my husband also suffers from depression and to be honest i found that just being there next to him whether its sitting in the bed just reading or being in the house as much as i can is a great comfort we arent all capable of expressing our feelings and at those times i just leave it until he is up to talking being bipolar myself i know how much i can give him before it affects me and i feel no guilt about it a weak me is going to be no good if he is weak too,1
if hes threatening to kill himself the threat should be taken seriously if hes got a therapist that person should be notified (at the least) if hes on medication it may be failing and something new may be needed at the worst he may need to be hospitalized again which (im sure) is not something either of them want to hear if hes a danger to himself his health and welfare is more important than anything else the poster may want to help their boyfriend but the truth is that they likely dont have the necessary skill set to do it and are too close to the problems an informed professional might be able to give him a better perspective on things the boyfriend needs to be talking to a therapist or needs to be in the hospital right now if hes gotten this bad thats the only advice i have sadly :(,1
i recently completed a 6 week treatment of tms for my depression and has worked wonders i completed the treatments about 2 months ago and havent been on medications except for my anxiety meds since almost the first treatment,1
you sound an aweful lot like me i was diagnosed with bipolar 16 some years ago and went through a really bad depression/high anxiety bout about a year and a half ago ive been treated like a guinea pig over the years with one med after the other which has made me very hesitant to change i also deal with low sex drive and my husband was (and still is) my biggest supporter but i finally found the right combination of medication therapy and ive become a facilitator for dbsa where i can help others who are still struggling i know changing meds can be scary but you owe it to yourself to be 100% the person you can be,1
i know how you feel i felt thst way since i was 13 years old its crippling and you lose hope and faith i suffer from bipolar mdd psychosis anxiety/panic disorder and ptsd i was put on everything from the moon at back i finally underwent ect with keto mine treatment 16 rounds it wore off 2 months ago fearing i needed more ect i went back to my dr and we went with lithium vraylar quetiapine clonazepam it has been a great success i regained my hope and faith in life it took 25 yrs but i cant remember the last 6 years of my life which iam ok with there is still hope never stop looking try old medications with new ones theres something out there if it gets really bad try clozaril its not just for schizophrenia patients they treat hard to treat depression with it hang in there,0
i so know where you are and what you are feeling sadly there are no easy answers when you are at this point of distress and frustrated you need to go back to basics start again and stick to your medications to work if you are not experiencing the worst reactions it takes 6 weeks to be effective  trust me i know 100 tries later for me there are new meds now that are terrific called 5th generation bipolar depression  im on a assortment plus this new one i in 40 years feel great please ask your doctorthese are all systemic of our disease and it sucks god bless you,1
ive been able to skip the self harm lately very hard but still go thru the shame/grief from just having wanted to do it,0
i am self-diagnosed bpd and medically diagnosed with bipolar ii social anxiety and major depression i know i have bpd unfortunately every time i try to being it up to my therapist and my psychiatrist they push it off as just my bipolar,1
its a struggle daily not to self harm  i hope i made it through this day,0
all i ÷ver hear is how crazy and psycho i am i just cant take it anymore after 8 years and many ups and downs we have decided to split up i know in my heart it is over i am so terrified i am going to fall into depression or mania which she predicted and some other very harsh things im just tired of the stigma and falling in it sometimes it sucks thanks for the rant,0
that person is most likely a narcissist and would find a way to make you look guilty/bad regardless of your mental issues trust me on this #narcissismsucks,0
i agree its so damn irritating one person said yo me your meds are making you mad really!!!!,0
its hard ive been there many times if you have a good day you must be manic if you have a bad day youre depressed if you get mad or upset with someone for the way they treat you youre crazy and need to get your meds in check i wish i knew the answer,0
i use to have that problem but now im on tygretol and wellbutrin and a new anti psychotic called sulfris not sure if i spelt that right and have had no weight gain issues there is no associated weight gain with any of those and they work very well my diagnosis goes between bi polar and schizo effective with agoraphobia and high anxiety but those meds seem to keep me very stable i was over 300lbs and yes i had help losing 175 of it but since then and the new meds ive had no issues with weight gain,1
i take lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine for bipolar psychosis and anxiety yes they mean weight gain over the past 3 yrs ive managed to lose 35kg ( not sure what that is in pounds) which isnt a lot but its still a loss i replace breakfast and lunch with diet shakes in particular optifast which i really like) and i have a small dinner trying to avoid carbs if possible i have chronic pain as well so moving is very painful but i manage to walk 2 20 min blocks 5 days a week to and from work and the train station im lucky that i have no choice to walk if i want to work its difficult and can be demotivating at times but it is possible take care,1
im afraid to get one what if i get tired of it? im so indecisive,0
oh yeah after my first miscarriage i spiraled down a dark depression hole i hadnt been down in a long time almost destroyed my relationship with my now husband i needed to mother something so when i brought up getting a kitten my husband jumped on it and agreed ended up finding a bonded pair siblings we couldnt separate so they both came home with us they pulled me out of that hole and saved me and my relationship my boy is currently curled up on my hip as i type hes always near me and knows when im upset or sick and he takes care of me,0
never say cant i struggled since a young age with schizoeffective disorder and borderline personality disorder been hospitalized many times and tried to kill myself twice i received healing and if i believed that i could not overcome this horrible deepest darkest nightmare i probably would not be here today the struggle is real but there is hope,0
a daily struggle,0
identify specific worries work to change what you can leave what you cant change with god,1
the struggles r real prayers huggz n lovz with groovy vibes of peace joy hope n faith wrapped up in groups of kindness ☮️,0
im sorry thats not true and whats more the bible doesnt teach that and it wont back you god is merciful and kind and the book of proverbs speaks repeatedly of his understanding the bible shows many who suffered from different illnesses and sense then many more plague people furthermore the letters to the congregations and the apostles in the greek scriptures share more detail of how we should console the depressed dont use the bible to crush the helpless i live in a family plagued by this illness and trust me if it was all in the head fearing god wouldve cured it a century ago you should stop talking and you are still quite ignorant,0
if societies expectations and institutionalisation wasnt so limited we wouldnt be suffering from these mental states we are not born into this world to be trained and taught how to live in only one acceptable state we are here for a purpose to share our natural positive gifts that cannot shine or enlighten us in a blinded high society that corrupts all that is natural and beautiful in ourselves and our beautiful world of abundance created to sustain us and all living things instead we bow down to monarchy and legal chaos to survive not intune with the divine essence of our human race but the disgrace of hypocricy and uncertainty of ourselves,0
dont think im anxious anymore more fucking angry than anything else but now on meds and feel calm and at times depressed,0
i cant even read it because of the red background the contrast will trigger an anxiety attack if i force myself to read it,0
what others do or think can make us hesitate to take a stand until we realize god holds the now and future in his hand,1
i live in aust and work in this system firstly get your keys back  even if it means police involvementmake your self safe the unfortunately until he actually hurts himself or someone you cant do anything so gently with someone there for support tell him he cant come to your house making threats and treating you that way  because of his age and reguadless of his age you cant do anything unless you are his legal guardian then he cant get a passport without your signature but its a lot of legal stuff and he needs to agree unless deemed unfit  but none of this will happen without him having an incident that called for legal interjection the law is very definitive for people with disabilities and mental health if you are threatened again or frightened lock yourself in the car or go to a neighbour and call police this can initiate the process he needs proper support from professionals maybe even a stay in a locked facility because you cant force him to take meds and even a group home isnt gonna help him in this state esp if hes violent  there are lots of rules in group homes you need to get the police involved have him sectioned to a ward for evaluation for fear of your and community safety its really awful to go through but please put yourself first and be safe ,0
just remember the page you are on and the people who are giving advice you are all he has and now the his mother has passed he is surely lost the trauma of losing her is most likely horrible for him as it is for you try to find this woman and explain the situation if you can  maybe just maybe she is ignorant of his disabilitys,0
he definitely needs professional care so hospitalization may be best he is clearly not capable of taking care of himself and while its good of you to worry and obviously try to help it is beyond your ability especially if he resorts to violence putting yourself in harms way to try to protect him is doing no one any benefit,1
if you are worried about your physical safety him having your house keys and all call the police and make a report then call mental health services in whatever state you live in and the police report will help fast track your brother to being seen and evaluated cant imagine what youre going through but the outbursts and threats/ physical violence are a priority in this situation,0
two points: 1 dont bring him to america 2 a hospital stay can only help dont fear the unknown- its all trial and error,1
since hes 30 can you even commit him to hospital without his consent if hes not currently a threat to himself or others? id call someone for legit advice hospital police if he is violent or let him make his own mistakes maybe he will learn about himself and the world if he goes to america,0
with his history he must be well known to services or have a case worker? if you have contact numbers ring them as soon as you can he is your brother but he is not your responsibility it is never easy to do this he is vulnerable and needs protection as much as you and your family do,0
you need to get him professional help he needs it for himself and for the women he threatens dont feel bad youll be doing the best thing for him,1
yescall a hospital because he is a vulnerable adult he is mentally incapable to make such a risky plan he also needs to get his his violent temper under control before he really hurts themor maybe even kills them i know he is your brother and you love him but only tough love will help him call hospital!,0
you need help call for help dont feel guilty just do it and live your life protect your self and him call for help,1
i have a nephew like this he has thrown stuff hit us his grandmother included wrapped his hands around our throats till finally we had to literally choose did we want to live in fear of what he could or would do to us and/or others after battling years and him physically attacking a police officer the courts understood our plea and put him in a mental institution its never the ideal situation,0
dont do nothing for me or my anxiety 400 mg 3 times a day im start to only use it once with my xanax when i have a bad panic attack just because,1
i believe this person is describing mindfulness it is a great tool in keeping in the moment and not obsessing about that which you cannot control rather it is a means of acceptance of yourself and that in which you can change,0
i am on gabopentin for anxiety and it knocks me out i sleep all night i have never been able to do that with any other med,1
i am on olanzapine/zyprexa for psychosis mood stabilising and anxiety including anxiety induced insomnia i sleep petty well now the thing that is disturbing my sleep is pain now but when that is under control i really do sleep well i also take lithium and mirtazapine i have bipolar and anxiety,1
have you considered using cannabis for stress and anxiety?,1
i have about 7 years of success with zyprexa for bipolar for anxiety for insomnia (to some degree i black out for 5 hours during which im said to be sleeping then up and down almost every hour since going back on the ambien too 10mg of zyprexa isnt touching my insomnia),0
zyprexa doesnt help me personally with sleep or anxiety i use ambien a few days then lunesta for sleep,1
i took ambien for about two years and it started doing that to me i too cannot figure out what works for sleep i wish i knew it is awful to have a horrible day and then lie in bed all night having panic attacks good luck to you a low dose of xanax helps me now but that also comes with its own demons wish i could help you more but i am in the same boat,1
i suffer from bipolar and anxiety and i take lithium and quetiapine plus diazapam,1
does it not affect anxiety more though does it chill you out ?,1
my advice would be to seek advice from a professional read about different anti depressants and their possible side effects - dint think anyone who has responded to your question as referred to anti depressant which is what you are asking about many antidepressants are also good for anxiety ocd etc too any drug has side effects ranging from minor to more severe and very common and rare sometimes you need to weigh up benefits of a drug against side effects and accept themas long as they are not severe,1
zonisamide followed by lithium both are mood stabilizers with agents designed to swat anxiety!,0
i use olanzapine its a mood stabiliser antipsychotic and it provides a calm from anxiety im also on lithium and mirtazapine all 3 can cause weight gain so im not sure which one or all to it but it has been the best for me outside medication i also use mindfulness it has been a godsend its easy to do you practice while you are feeling ok so when you start to feel anxious you can use it check it out online you can even get apps for your phone,1
thanks sue i dont like to see guys treating people in an adverse way it gets us all tarred with same brush her guy has issues but she is not the cause if anything he is the cause of her anxiety   i hope she gets support via this group who will put her in the right direction of realising her true worth once she accepts how important she is she will be able to then choose who she shares her life with and not feel she has to stay with a manipulative jerk because he has made her lose her own identity to support his    ,1
your guy is a control freak and using what is known as projection techniques making you feel everything is your fault he is incapable of thinking of you as he is a narcissist and wants the world to revolve around him you need someone who will support you when youre low and share the bad times as well as the good and not lay the blame at your feet   you are worth more than he is but you need to show him this   tell him to take a hike and come back when he appreciates what your feeling what depression and anxiety is and how low it makes you feel once he has had a taste of you not caring about him and concentrating on yourself it may teach him a serious life lesson if not your better off on your own   dont allow yourself your feelings or emotions be manipulated by a fool that doesnt support you!   good luck ,0
my mom does this to me sometimes my partner and i chose to get married abroad and she decided she didnt want to come blamed money but we had offered to pay for her flight and she found an excuse anyway two days before we were due to fly she rang me and said that i didnt see what i was doing that it was because i was bipolar and depressed that i wasnt considering her feelings and we should essentially be doing things on her terms it upset me massively thing is it wasnt me i had done everything to include her and she had refused it was a means for her to try to gain control over me we went ahead with the wedding and didnt let her stop me you might love your partner lots but you have to ask yourself why he is doing this is he trying to control you too? x,0
yup we make up being depressed fearful manic so much fun! we love messing with people starting fights being told its all in our heads im sorry if a doc diagnosed us then they arent the ones that are wrong but our family and friends that treat us like liars are,0
the problem with those with mental illness is they can easily be taken advantage of and people can easily manipulate them make them feel like they are crazy at fault all that time because they refuse to take responsibility for their own actions the gaslighting mentioned by alice sounds a lot of what hes doing if he refuses to see that you are ill and making an effort to get better and be supportive i know this sucks you dont need him its not healthy for you to constantly struggle to be better so you dont lose a relationship that is not doing well because your partner is manipulating you into feeling worse focus on you your health and mentality is all that matters right now not him,0
and it seems like her comment is gone talking herself up like she chose help and we dont "im a success story im not a victim your opinion is your own im going to continue to better myself" saying we arent trying we sit in this group and play victim oh and we are insecure apparently shes all perfect now because she doesnt get mad lol and because she chooses to love and have confidence she made me feel like a piece of shit! well if shes all better she can leave she was a piece,0
ah it is genetic folks and a huge struggle ,0
struggling to do things people consider normal on a daily basis is tiring af eugh anxiety u cunt!,0
im so with you there i dont even go to the shops or for a walk i dont even go to the mail box anxiety is exactly that kayleigh,0
im pretty familiar with ssri meds if i had to guess this is probably more for anxiety or sedation medication i have been on seroquel before dont believe i was on the xr as far as being worried because ssri dont agree with you this isnt of the ssri medications,1
i did on on seroquel xr and celexa which is am anti depressant or just wasnt the right fit though and i kept having breakthrough episodes mostly of hypomania and i had to stay on my anti-anxiety meds but i tried it for almost two years so it didnt have any major side effects,1
ive been on that combo for about 4 years now its honestly the only combo to work for me ive been on almost every med they make and was diagnosed bipolar 2 when i was 13 i also have 3 children the seroquel xr wasnt for me it made me feel like i have restless leg syndrome i hope you find that it works as well for you,1
ask for sertraline taken in the morning it keeps u on track in the day and its effects stil help u sleep in the evening i do not have bipolar i have suffered from differing degrees of depression and anxiety son and of since i was 15 and am in a good place now with this medicine i will be 60 this year i hope they finally find themedicaton that will help you ,1
thanks for sharing! med changes can be way scary checking in with family and friends and your therapist and other team will help in this timei so appreciate you sharing this,0
also? if youre worried about drug interactions drugs dot com has a great interaction checker i use it before putting anything new in my mouth ever,1
in australia prescription medication isnt allowed to be advertised only the over the counter stuff it would annoy me using actors although a person with anxiety and/or depression might be too anxious or depressed to actually do an ad what would be good is if they consulted with people that are affected by the illness and maybe had people say what its really like so am actor had a small understanding of what its like,0
talk to her we are all different as for me i dont like to talk to my husband about it its embarrassing so i just want him to leave me alone and give me space when i cry,0
just be understanding my wife left me about 4 months ago because she didnt know how to handle my anxiety and depression because it was so hard to explain to her how badly it changed who i was just be supportive and listen if shes worth it to you keep fighting and know shes not doing it to upset you,0
let me first say that i think its awesome that youre reaching out to see how best to handle this situation and the love that shows you have for your fiancee i have been with my husband for 15 years now married for nine of them the best advice he would give is never minimize or make fun of the way shes feeling something bipolar people in general feel things more intensely people in the hypomanic (bipolar 1) spectrum feel things even more deeply we are prone to be more angry fearful and hurtful to those closest to us in my case i would constantly question why anyone would want to be with me do not take this as a personal attack against you it is more indicative of how we feel about ourselves gently make sure she is taking care of herself--meds proper rest proper eating etc when im in a depressive low my husband has to remind to shower read and educate yourself on the disorder triggers and symptoms so you can help see if a cycle is happening even if she gets angry with you do it anyway most importantly remember that she is a person not a mental illness and thats who you fell in love with in the first place good luck to you both ,0
ive read a lot of posts but i eventually cried over yours and i began to feel sick to my stomach that i had nothing rightful to say to you in the moment so i shut my phone and ran an errand got my composure back and me back and eventually returned to you i think you have to call upon your son and open up write a list first of whats wrong and then give it to him to process you must give your son an open door to possibly collaborate to help you it would be absolutely cruel of you to take your life without giving him a chance to earnestly help you hes your son he loves you more than words ever do second there are people called life coaches this ties in to you wanting to get back to your old self these folks have seen it all nothing to be shy about try it youve got nothing to lose i do happen to believe that serious depression benefits from mood stabilizers since anti depressants can make things way worse talking lithium zonisamide type drugs with a sprinkling of antidepressant and force yourself to write down a list of what you know you enjoy even though you arent doing it share it with your son and the life coach collectively youll gently come up with a plan no more talk of suicide or those thoughts for at least a month just barr them from having any power over you not an option i just gave you a slew of things to do my friend!! xxxx,0
emma peetz nelson meds cant fix everything dear friend ive had these thoughts for years and when they seem overwhelming i seek more intense help it is what is some days/weeks/months are better than others love you peet!,0
i have very few friends and there is nothing wrong with that go for quality over quantity meeting new people is not a problem trusting them is so dont try to stop worrying about other people if they really dont like you they will soon be out of your life but try to enjoy their company as they pass through it some will stick around and will be willing to wait for you to "open up" in a few months/years/whatever you may actually feel different towards them and feel more trusting and secure i know it is difficult im going through this process myself but im slowly giving up a life of isolation for a life with a few acquaintances who may one day be friends and im winning as im not so isolated any more still have no friends who i totally trust but maybe that will come but as i say im already ahead by being able to join in with company start with little steps one after the other and see how far you can get,0
personally id set an alarm if at all possible set the title for the alarm as "breakfast" or "remember to eat" its something i do on my days off work because i tend to get preoccupied and end up just having little to no food or fluids setting an alarm has worked wonders and now i eat on or around the time the alarm is set naturally because im so used to doing it,0
stay on your meds see your dr and get a good therapists im in the same boat exercise some way it alleviates depression and anxiety,1
after my visit to docs today to be told " ive been seeing that docs place for 2 yrs and should be normal now and taking my meds not trying to lessen or zero my meds and still have anxiety days" i felt like telling him my anxiety has been with me for over 2 decades and have always done what everyone wanted me to do to get better not what i needed to do to get better and in the last year or two i have had improvements and what the hell is normal im different not broken im me i would rather be interactive with my mental health plannot complacent and just take what im told,0
effexor and latuda are my perfect combination for panic attacks and depression,1
have you ever had anxiety attack where you think your going to die cause you cant take a breathe,1
heather marie awan a nice read crazy tho i go to bed late and wake up early in a panic,0
karla kremer breister me to a t bleh stupid anxiety,1
anxiety drains the life from you,1
serious therapy medication if that doesnt work and you still worry about being a danger to yourself or someone else hospitalization i was terrified of what that would mean but admitting myself to the hospital saved my life,1
glad to hear you are going back to therapy that is the first step you may also want to concider medications if you are not already; they have helped me a lot (diagnosed at 8 as well) in the meantimeif you feel a mood swing take a step back remove yourself from the situation and breath slowly concentrate on your body limb by limb slowly and relax; meditation can help too it sounds silly but it can work the self harm will be more tricky it helped me to keep my hands busy during triggering situations i took up knitting crocet and drawing it also helps distract from the anxiety giving you something manual to concentrate on,1
if it gets bad go to the hospital dont fuck around i cut my throat in november and was hospitalized for 11 days got out family abandoned me wife left lost job now im trying to rebuild my life dont wait too long if youre feeling suicidal go to the hospital now i have a nice scar no shame in going for help,0
you are ill you know you are ill and are trying to get help that in itself is difficult and very brave of you for the first time ever ive been in the same situation and to be honest ive felt shame but that is the illness shaming because you and i have nothing to be ashamed about things get so overwhelming and out of control and for me i self harm to change my focus because im clearly not taking care of myself and it forces me to do that im not sure what your reason is but changing your focus is important but finding a healthy way to do that is even more important especially finding something to keep your focus that you enjoy doing art colouring reading watching tv cooking for friends asking for help dont be afraid to ask for that im not sure what relationship you have with your family but if you are close to them they will understand if not find other avenues of support you need to surround yourself with people who will stick with you and realize how difficult that level of control is or can be if you want them in your life write them a letter or sit down and talk to them tell them what you need and why tell them that you need them that you love them doing that is all you can do and sometimes knowing that you atleast tried is all you can do focus on you and your health i wish the best for you and your struggle ❤️,0
its definitely not 100% preventable  way to make people feel even worse about themselves and more guilty,0
i fright it everyday just to try to have a good dayi have the morning sickness with mine am sick of haven morning sickness you get thinking you are pregnant with all the morning sickness some people think its funny because you have depression panic anxiety and bipolar when you have a spell people laugh cuz i think its funny well its not funny it really hurts people that have it some people even miss a lot of things in their life because of it,0
i have more than just dogs and my only current dog is my service dog i am more worried about my various reptiles who need various things because they are rescues and come to me as special needs anything from every few hours of hand watering and a few times a day of hand feeding to just giving meds once a day the issue is i have their trust a lot of them could seriously injure who ever watches them i also have birds and rodents and cats too one of my cats is a diabetic until i can find someone to take care of all of them i cant in good conscious ever put myself first and cost is one of the things that holds me back i have a vet who could do all of them but it would likely cost several hundred dollars for all of them just for 24 hours i would rather put that towards their vet fund i feel there should be a simpler answer but i guess there isnt thanks for all the suggestions everyone,0
if to feel people start to play games i stop them mid sentence saying your comments are making me feel uncomfortable would you like to clarify or should we just agree to stop the conversation? its usually the same people so if they hear that enough they tend to stop it takes abut of courage but you are courageous just getting out of bed and facing the day so find that courage to stand up for yourself it builds your strength,0
do you have a closed group? im not worried about talking openly but ive noticed you get quite a few anonymous questions in which people may benefit from also having a group thats closed so that we can ask better questions about their situation to respond without guessing unk parts if you do id like to join (or if you start one) i believe with closed groups friends and family cant see what groups theyre following or the conversations thanks,0
bipolar/anxiety/depression open page,1
when i took lamictal i would have severe anger then the next minute i would be crying uncontrollably for me it was the worst med ive taken my dr took me off immediately,1
first of all why would we compare them? theyre both horrible and unacceptable but if we are going to compare them - physical abuse can become murder and it almost always comes with emotional abuse emotional abuse alone is dreadful and i wish no one ever experienced it but i cant say its worse again why compare? stop them both!,0
chronic persistent emptiness and low mood is one of the characteristics of bpd when i was much younger i used to overdose like you every few weeks partly as i felt so bad i wanted to be in physical pain but also to cleanse and start again as i would try to do things get on with my life but things would always just spiral downwards every few weeks at the time i dont think i had insight but looking back i do still self harm i hadnt for years up until past few years when things have been bad again im in the uk and i was diagnosed with bpd about 25 yrs ago at a time when it wasnt even thought to be a proper mental illness and as a result no treatment i have since been diagnosed with bp2 and also suffer from depression and anxiety things have changed since then and it is recognised as serious mi and therapy especially dbt which is a form of cbt is the most beneficial so far as medical records i dont think anyone has ever mentioned bpd or any other of my diagnoses in any detail gp or consultants and oh always write in very general terms in what they say they may refer to underlying mh issues but they will not specify diagnosis i have always worked in my adult life and have been on long term sick several times recently 3 months and 11 months 2015-2016 and 8 months in 2012-2013 the medical line from hospital basically says nothing and gp will ask what you want put on your line is stress depression etc i have never really had specific therapy for my bpd so it has been always underlying everything theres no specific medication for bpd but depression anxiety commonly accompany bpd or as a consequence of how it impacts on your life even on the medications especially antidepressants which i know help i still struggle with feelings of emptiness and pointlessness and feeling worthless but i can tell when im also severely depressed and when im not of course you may not have bpd but it isnt to be ashamed of and unless you tell people no one will know,0
thank you i sometimes feel like my thoughts and sadness are just in my head and i need to just snap out of it but ive tried to "just snap out of it"it doesnt work so i just kind of "coast through life" with the fake smile and the "im oks" then i feel guilty because my issues arent "real" issues then im angry for feeling like this and then the pretending like its all ok the never ending cycle of ups and downs i sometimes feel like im living "groundhog day" over and over and over how do i deal with this never ending feeling of hopelessness? i just cant no matter how hard i try or how much i read about it or how hard i try to lie to myself that it will all be ok,0
if your niece doesnt know about what has happened to you and what youre going through i can understand that she puts herself first and is probably a bit hurt that youre not going to her wedding this said i dont think you should go to the wedding cause if youre not upto being around your stepfather which is totally understandable!! you shouldnt put yourself in such a position ever! especially not if you have a saying in it which in this case you do! if you should feel guilty towards your niece you can still pay her a visit to wish her good luck if she doesnt appreciate the gesture thats her problem! try to find at least one person who accepts you for who you are where you can rely on and understands that youre not always upto being around people  it makes a big difference if you have "a person" then you wont feel so alone you are worthy of having someone who you dont have to explain yourself to just being you should be/is enough! big hug to you!,0
take care of you dont let anyone guilt you into doing anything that will make you more sick when you are stronger and healthier talk to your family with the helpful of a therapist to educate them you are beautiful you are amazing dont let anyone tell you different,0
yes put yourself first i know this is hard but my brother got me this book that was titled"dont sweat the small stuffand its all small stuff" mind you my sister nlaw told me after my brother killed himself this past september 22there is 10 months and 3 days between both suicides my dad was my abuserand my brother only months before told me he knew why my dad did to me(a blessing) since i carried the nightmare since i was young and now i 50 it was hard to tell myself its all small stuff after i was the last to talk to my brother before he killed himselfbut he was sick and he isnt suffering with esphogaus and stomach cancerwhich he got from being in the marines/ camp lagune nc drinking contaminated water the whole military base waslife is really hard for most of us out there and you have to take time for yourselfto healwhat you are troubled about hopefully you will find some peace hopefully you have a friend you can talk todo you have an animal who needs you and can give you some unconditional love i have too tried many times to kill myself but we have unfinished business if the father doesnt take us i can say a dog can be real medicine when we are strugglingdont give up and im not a cat person but there are so many critters who need a home and they never leave us when we are in need just know others struggle and we need to support each other when possible,0
you do what you need to do absolutely put yourself first if they cant understand well that isnt your problem its theirs i am flying out of state in a week to go to my little brothers wedding my bipolar depression my agoraphobia and anxietymy borderline ugh its all flaring right now im really pushing myself to go because hes my only sibling and i helped raise him i just really want to be there im not going to let my mental illness stop me but thats my situation if there is an abuser in that scenario or your mental health is too overwhelming right now you have every right to not go do what you need to do to stay safe and stable you cant help what you have and it isnt your fault dont let anyone make you feel guilty for something you didnt chose to have in the first place i hope you are able to slow down and settle for a little while you will get back to where you need to be huge hugs <3,0
put yourself first i wouldn´t go if it triggered me this is one of those times you need to cut out the toxic people in your life if they can´t understand what you´re going through than you don´t need them to bring you down either they respect your wishes or they don´t it may seem like alienation but you´re trying to survive with mental illnesses you can´t control the way your mind is they will come back around when they realize you´re trying to make yourself better seek therapy and stay in it it´s hard for people like me with borderline to find a good therapist or stay in therapy i highly suggest dbt that´s a good therapy for borderlines we are our greatest enemies it´s okay to say no don´t worry about pleasing everyone your sanity will thank you for putting you first those people have their own issues they need to work on themselves yoga helps writing in a journal helps dbt helps replace negative thinking with positive thoughts find positive quotes online and write them down start with one little thing that´s positive and work on that you´ll see a slow change,1
great advice! i agree! im on my 3rd week of group dbt therapy and was hesitant at first but its actually comforting to know im not alone and now with a caring group of people not knowing her whole situation (whether the niece knows or not) she may be trying to show she cares by insisting for her being there maybe not knowing? if she knows then she should definitely be more understanding if not its good to know she cares enough to want her there i know not being wanted is a bad feeling as well its a shame abusers go unpunished in a perfect world shed be able to attend and that jerk would be banned sad,0
medication is only part of the solution i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder i would strongly suggest seeing a psychologist/therapist while you are waiting do some research on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness they have been a godsend therapy along with the right meds mean i can hold down a good full time job now i have my bad days and i tend to collapse on the weekend it i still feel i have a purpose medication can be a lot of trial and error it took me 18 mths to get the right combo also be careful of xanax you can either grow dependant on it or you can just get used to it so you need more to give you adequate relief chat to your dr about your meds and therapy it can and does get better it just takes time,1
i was on latuda but it levelef out after awhile im off of it now im bi polar too with anxiety and a touch of agoraphobia (thats not wanting to leave your place) i have to force myself to go places sometimes im on lamictal and am on welbutrin busar for anxiety i still have not much energy but enough to go about my daily things which alot are a regular routine all i know to do is tell my meds dr about whats going on and whether you think your meds are doing you any good try n stay positive,0
i have autism spectrum disorder whatever that means anymore i hardly talk to many people about it because the main symptom of it is adhd which everyone seems to have these days but the big one im dealing with right now is depression and anxiety that i have had for years and years,1
muthafuckas like to mumble about your struggle tell everybody they know what goes on with you laugh at me as if its something funnywow fuckin humans,0
i dont think anyone really understands how strong you are you are the ones who struggle daily to get out of bed and face the day and even those days you stay in it is a fight keep fighting you are true warriors,0
its hard i find it shameful being in this position im a strong womani shit myself off,0
im not ashamed of mine however i choose not to talk about it as openly as i have in the past because i believe it scares people & pushes them away learned that the hard way (no true friends) pushed everyone away i only have my immediate family now & im completely fine with that they understand me & actually care someday ill have a friend who truly cares until then im good! ill occasionally mention my mental illnesses but only to empathize with others so they know they are not alone im me thats all i can be no more no less just perfectly me ,0
having a mental illness is a hell of a battle i have depression and anxiety,1
i understand completely i have depression and anxiety,1
especially when they avoid eye contact while being your partner ,0
for me it depends on the person texting/calling i see the number or name and panic most times i just dont answer i have a few hard calls to make in a couple of hours been up all night worrying,0
this is exactly why i avoid making phone calls or any kind! & i hate talking on the phone regardless of who it is i get super anxious,0
well done that is fantastic what youve done you should be proud of yourself that took some guts and courage x i understand what its like its awful im laid awake now worrying about tomorrow and im on holiday its my first night its been a big worry for me to even come i had hoped it would get better when i got here im with some lovely friends were touring scotland it should be exciting but it isnt my anxiety is soring like you say a manic day would be a lovely rest but then it would be spoilt by the depressions afterwards what a lovely life we lead hope you keep up the driving its a big accomplishment x,0
thank you for your comments im sorry your anxiety didnt give you a break hopefully to get to enjoy your time even if its for a short time at a stretch take care,0

having a mental illness sucks its impossible for others to understand unless youre showing physical signs it is no different than cancer heart disease diabetes etc all these conditions require medication in order to get better the mental anguish we go through is hell its frustrating not to be understood or express ourselves i take it one day at a time i cant predict whats going to happen tomorrow or how im going to feel i know how you feel ive been there and live with the fear of being there again in the meantime you do you screw everybody else you come first your mental well being comes first you are important to us and we care about you or we wouldnt be replying find something that makes you happy each daydont worry about tomorrow hugs,0
underlying factors “much of the decision to die is in the construing of events” says kay redfield jamison professor of psychiatry at the johns hopkins university school of medicine she adds: “most minds when healthy do not construe any event as devastating enough to warrant suicide” eve k mościcki of the us national institute of mental health notes that many factors—some of them underlying—work together to lead to suicidal behavior such underlying factors include mental and addictive disorders genetic makeup and brain chemistry let us consider some of them foremost among these factors are mental and addictive disorders such as depression bipolar mood disorders schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse research in both europe and the united states indicates that more than 90 percent of completed suicides are associated with such disorders in fact swedish researchers found that among men who were not diagnosed with any disorders of that kind the suicide rate was 83 per 100000 but among the depressed it jumped to 650 per 100000! and experts say that the factors leading to suicide are similar in eastern lands still even the combination of depression with triggering events does not make suicide inevitable professor jamison who once attempted suicide herself says: “people seem to be able to bear or tolerate depression as long as there is the belief that things will improve” however she has found that as the cumulative despair becomes unbearable the ability of the mental system to restrain suicidal impulses gradually weakens she likens the situation to the way that the brakes on a car are worn thin by constant stress it is vital to recognize such a trend because depression can be treated feelings of helplessness can be reversed when the underlying factors are dealt with people may react differently to the heartaches and stresses that often trigger suicide some think that one’s genetic makeup may constitute an underlying factor in many suicides true genes play a role in determining one’s temperament and studies reveal that some family lines have more incidents of suicide than others yet “a genetic predisposition to suicide by no means implies that suicide is inevitable” says jamison brain chemistry too can be an underlying factor in the brain billions of neurons communicate electrochemically at the branched-out ends of the nerve fibers there are small gaps called synapses across which neurotransmitters carry information chemically the level of one neurotransmitter serotonin may be involved in a person’s biological vulnerability to suicide the book inside the brain explains: “a low serotonin level    can dry up the wellsprings of life’s happiness withering a person’s interest in his existence and increasing the risk of depression and suicide” the fact is however that nobody is destined to commit suicide millions of people cope with heartaches and stresses it is the way the mind and the heart react to pressures that leads some to kill themselves not just the immediate triggering causes but the underlying factors must also be dealt with so then what can be done to create a more positive outlook that will regenerate a measure of zest for life?,1
please dont end your beautiful life sure things are bad but just right now anything can happen at any moment dont lose faith my brother committed suicide and it has truly had a lasting effect on my and my familys lives i have attempted suicide many times still here i am 51 years old and still struggle with suicidal thoughts you have to start thinking differently you are responsible for your happiness dig deep and build yourself up and find a reason to move on i care about you i want you to be here on this earth with me and everyone else who knows exactly how you feel be strong my friend,0
many of us can relate to your hurt frustration and fear very few of my family/friends know about my depression i think its better that way because they dont understand cant expect them to im not looking for sympathy and often thats what happens or like many say family/friends look at you different and think its just a "phase or situation" we have to take one minute at a time with this cut out toxic people and situations in your life even if it means "being alone" i find its easier that way god is my strength,0
please realize lots of us out here are sufferingi lost my dad and brother to suicide theres 10 months and 3 days between both dying my brother left me september 22and i struggle with the loss of my brother as i was the last to talk to him i am sorry that i didnt say the right thing just saying please dont give upnever know what you will see next month or next year and miss out on,0
no matter how much we want our families to understand what we go through they never will the only people who have true empathy for us are our fellow survivors i say survivors because we have to battle our brains on a daily basis but we survive maybe we go through this to be able to help one another ive been fighting this battle for over 40yrs my life is chaotic on the inside but its still a life worth living most people fear what they dont understand and will lash out and we scare the hell out of them all you can say to them is that "this is what i need to do to live my life your approval is not needed but your help would be appreciated" seek out a support group as a place to vent your daily problems feelings fears etc so you can see that you arent alone in this when we isolate ourselves and only use our family for support it will amplify the pain suicide usually happens in a moment of helplessness and darkness it sucks at that moment but it will pass find something right now that you have a passion for it can be anything that makes you feel happy and alive if you need to loose yourself in books movies video games searching the internet hiking listening to music going out with a friend etc go for it just tell the illness that you need a break and delve into something you want to do its a part of you but not the only part of you just know that you were born this way because your soul is strong and can find your way and all the people who commented are sending you support acceptance of who you are and love for a fellow human being we care about you and the pain youre in we see you you are not alone,0
my family is horrible also since my illness diagnosis they have only made things worse is there anyway you can distance yourself from them? getting away from them any way you can might be the best thing right now do not let them or the illness win! battle on because you are worth it even if nobody else seems to know or get it!,0
please put your fear and doubt in the lords hands he will see you through never lose hope prayers for you always,0

my anxiety attacks came on when things were fine people need to realize they arent caused by *stress* they pop up randomly and theres still not any explanation why,1
stig we have all heard it!!! i heard it most from a mom whose sick made my sick sicker (if you can understand that) it took me a lifetime to understand my illness and the things that are triggers i am 45 for my mother to accept she had a mental illness she believed she was admitting to being "crazy" that great old stigmatism! she might take medications for a minute but when they started doing what they should she was " healed" and would quit taking them i learned unfortunately i am a much healthier (still bi polar still have ptsd anxiety panic attacks) but much healthier me with out my sick mom in it heart breaking as i have not spoke to her for over 15 yrs but i learned i cant fix her i can only fix me i do this with meds therapy and staying out of situations that can set me off ( its like a pitch black roller coaster ride never know which way its going to turn) its ironic right? my sick mom telling me i should be normal i was acting out for attention my fav its all in your head that one was right just not the way she meant it im doing great i do what i need to do to be healthy i cant say that for my mom her life is very sad i work hard to not be that person,0
i understand what you mean but cant you keep a v basic contact with ur mum she did give birth to you of course you need to keep stress to a minimum but i think her life maybe sadder without contact from you all mothers miss their kids its just a suggestion but it wud be better than having regrets later and if u agree she ill then her comments prob stem from that i myself have a difficult relationship with my mum i try to keep basic contact,0
when i was still at school i had another student ask me "why arent you normal" i asked him "define normal" and he just looked confused for a couple seconds before walking away,0
i attempted suicide at age 13 my mom shamed me got angry w methen i became aneorxic and lost 35 lbs in a month she didnt noticethen she died suddenly of a stroke while we were on april vacation from school she was alive when we went on vaca dead and creamated when we went backno one knew it was awful my life was awful after that for sooo many years i truly thought she died to punish me cuz she didnt love me so i hated myselfit was awful its been 40 yrs now and m much better but it still hurts,0
thats bc the brain isnt fully developed and alot of depression or anxiety symptoms are simple side effect of youth and hormones and they may not handle it as well as others i fucking death in the family makes you depressed for a timei was born depressed no event made me that way do some research,1

you make me very sad i know what it feels like to feel as though that is the only answer to feel like it would make it easier but friend you can be happy there are ways to end all that pain without taking your life you cant control others you cant control their behavior or their feelings or how they treat you you can only control you push away from those things or people who make you miserable and start again i have found when i walk away from those things that make me unhappy it is a relief they say you shouldnt run from your problems but there is nothing wrong with letting go of toxic things and toxic people if you want to talk you can private message me,0

self harm does not generally mean that someone is hurting themself in order to kill themselves - people who self harm generally do as a copies mechanism to deal with distress hurt pain or to actually feel something it doesnt mean they are at the point of suicide  these are things that can distract until the urge or compulsion to harm calms down rather than burn or cut yourself for instance and leave permanent damag or harm its to try and find something that does not cause permanent damage such as ice cubes drawing on arms with red paint or excercise etc,0
i know the struggle take care and please try to find people to surround yourself that are understanding compassionate and supportive family relations are important but if they are unable to be there for you you may need to distance yourself to find what you need to be well take care,1
no source offered for the picture could just be made up or a picture of a brain of someone stuck in traffic could also be a picture made by sanding through multiple layers of paint on a used car that aside: everyone is good and worthy of love and humanity irrespective of similarities or differences illness heritage skin color etc normal is something fearful conforming boring people call themselves when faced with creativity diversity and psychology strive to be a great you be thoughtful be open minded and you will realize that normal is only an illusion the universe is better with you in it,0

thank you cathy allen and i have to retained a lawyer and unfortunately is not the best i could have got have been denied once and waiting for a decision now and am about 3 months in to that decision only makes me more anxious,0
i worked in non-clinical jobs for our local hospital for 23 years i worked 2 years longer than my psychiatrist wanted me too i am now seeking disability i have bipolar disorder ptsd general anxiety and on the physical side fibromyalgia i was out of work for about 8 months before i could really look back and see how stressed out i was i believe i was close to a breakdown i have my disability hearing in july after being out of work 2 and a half years,1
i think you might need to try a less stressful environment with predictable patients and hours- could you work in an office? like a physicians office? or have you thought of applying for disability? it is not much money but after two years you get access to health care,1
even recovery rooms can be extremely stressful some patients do not come out of anesthesia well at all- having screaming and violent episodes (through no fault of their own),0
those can be very stressful environment- do not suggest there,0
take a step down from rn think of being a school nurse less stressful,1
consider going that four hours youre more valuable than your illnesses itll work for you ive found in 60 years of depression/anxiety that the right doctor can make a huge difference!!! do it!,1
i run my families life cuz i carnt be on my own in the house or out cuz of panic attacks c,0
i agree with susan bates i know what you mean about good days and bad days the bad days can be miserable if we allow them to find more positive supporting friends activities hobbies your family sounds very supportive allow them to help you when you are overwhelmed you are not a burden to anyone god bless,0
no you dont ruin every thing thats youre depression and anxiety telling you that your family wont think that at all they sound like they want to support you so let them they love you and want the best for you its very hard to see when youre not well you are very lucky to have a caring family embrace it and take strength from it when youre feeling a bit better have a think about it think how youd react if it was a member of your family that had your illness youd probably want to be there for them its difficult to see whilst youre ill fighting the demons suck to living life out of you and youre unable to think rationally like you said you feel on burden on everyone you know but were not take care i hope you have a good period soon listen to your family then x,0
this is your damaged mind saying this not the true you you want to live life and see your children grow but the illness makes it difficult try not to feel guilty or have shame over what your illness is doing to you just keep living life and seek help if you can surround yourself with a support network and believe that one day you will pull through this dark cloud,0
i feel exactly the same my son is 22 now now but i feel ive been a terrible mother and he deserved better hes had so much to put up with from such a young age he was 10 when i got diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar i talk to him about it which is usually when im depressed and he always says ive been a fantastic mam and that theres no need to worry about it he said he had a really good up bringing and couldnt have been more loved ive been a single mother from him being 6 your children will probably say the same to you one day were good parents but just have more to deal with than other families x,0
i constantly struggle with the fear that i will never be happy i have a loving caring understanding wife and an amazing intelligent creative and very loving four year old daughter i should be strengthened by their presence in my life yet i still feel crippled by fear and doubt ive been actively working on improving myself over the last six years and i feel like ive barely made it to where i should have been at 22-23 im 28 now being an extreme introvert and having an anxiety disorder ocd poor impulse control and fibromyalgia makes it feel impossible to be my best and be happy financial insecurity is also a problem sorry if this was just an unhelpful rant basically i struggle with happiness and have been told i dont know what joy is,0

i am on both hydroxyzine and seroquel i dont really think the hydroxyzine helps with anxiety it does make you sleepy and i cant sleep if i dont have the seroquel hopes this helps,1
hydroxyzineit is not a strong drug but works for anxiety serequil is hard core and hard to get off hydroxyzine is also used for itching basically its a benadryl on steroids,1
hydroxyzine calmed me but also put me to sleep it was fast acting the seroquel i just stored taking because it have me the worst restless legs ive ever experienced but as they have all said its different for everybody all you can do is try it and find out,1
god not seraquil also named quitepin they hand them out in old peoples home to keep them quiet when u first take them u feel like u have been brainwashed horrible nasty drug,0
seroquil scares me  i stopped taking it because it was making me sleep walk freaked me out,1
hi i have been on citalopram and sertraline for severe clinical depression in the past neither added to the quality of life and between them the side effects werent good recently i have been made reundant and also threatened with homelessness all within a month my anxiety and depression is through the roof my gp suggested i try an snri instead of the usual ssri he put me on venlaflaxine for both anxiety and depression after 3 weeks i feel in a much better place and apart from a mild headache during the first week i have had no side effects at all and that includes in the area of your life that ssris usually spoil ,1
i have taken both seroquel caused me rapid excess weight gain (40 lb over 2 months) vistaril (hydroxyzine) did not help with my anxiety,1
im on seroquel have been for almost 10 years i love it its a mood stabilizer and given for sleep im on 600mg now but find that i wake up feeling refreshed didnt like the extended release because i felt like i had restless leg syndrome but the regular release works awesome before seroquel i would stay awake for weeks with no sleep in sight,0
hydroxyine (vistaril) is an antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions nausea sickness and tension and anxiety as it has sedative effect seroquel is an anti psychotic not an anti depressant and normally prescribed in addition to an anti depressant if person is suffering depression,1
oops didnt mean to send that yet hydroxyzine works with my minor anxiety but not much else good luck,1
i have taken seraquel for years and it helped with my agitation i take it at night and sleep good now that my anxiety is better before i took trazdone for sleep it works great but as my anxiety improved it would make me tired,1
hydroxyzine works great for my panic attacks and calms down my anxiety,1
hydroxyzine is amazing for pain or if youre going through withdrawals from drugs or coming down from drugs and seroquil worked for maybe 2 weeks for me i took it for sleep but then i started getting restless leg syndrome and muscle spasms would be up all night you also gain a lot of weight on seroquil so be careful!,1
im in between medications i accepted my diagnosis in 2014 when you see the worry in the faces of the people who love you you realize that theres a problem i have bipolar i borderline social anxiety ptsd and generalized anxiety disorder i dont want to see that look of worry and panic in their faces again its nice to silence the noise in your head ive probably battled all my diagnosis since i was 10 i can remember acting out of anger and frustration for so many years now that i lived with them for 27 years im still here ive learned to find artistic outlets to keep my mind busy i will always have that struggle but its up to me if i want to go back down that dark road again i choose not to let my mental illnesses take over my life im lucky that i have an accepting family and a wonderful husband it doesnt matter how others feel about me as long as i have my family in my corner i can face anything i know this sounds hokey but its true i want to defy the odds so many therapists list that i cant do this or that i want to prove them wrong it takes a lot of time to realize it isnt really you its just your brain is on a different wavelength than so called "normal" people but who is really normal anyway?,0
vitamin d is helpful for mood function and niacin is also supposed to be a great supplement as well fish oil and a regular diet help too! dont be afraid to lower your stress level for your own peace of mind! (cbt and meditation are also amazing check out meditationoasiscom for guided meditations too,1
yes i take supplements but my lamatical as well i struggle to comment on these pages because everyone is so different and i dont want to send a wrong message i had to find what worked for me for me its working on mind body and spirit,1
ive got borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder its nothing like did what i personally do is google things when i need to get info if you arent getting many answers here (because maybe we dont know either) google is good :) just start off with "what is the difference between?" or you could ask your doctor?,1
if you try it please let us know how it is cause im thinking of using it myself but am shy cause i never enjoyed pot,0
will be end of june before i start as im going to amsterdam that month so im going to look into what strains have high cbd/low thc and then go from there will keep the group updated though,0
talk to your kid do they know if his parents are supportuve types and hes hust afraid they wont accept him for being gay? or are they assholes? if he isnt already being ostracized by hus parents for everything go to them dont say anything about gay but let them know you are concerned about his cutting,0
could your daughter maybe invite him for a sleepover giving you chance to talk to him and get help? i imagine if hes gay and afraid to tell his parents that hes feeling very alone and could make a huge difference to know he does have support and people that care x,0
i totally agree his parents need to be told you arent the childs guardian if something does happen you may be at risk of blame which could mean a trip to the courts,1
you always have someone  even though you wont feel like it a boy is a boy  boys are dumb and never know a good thing before its too late dont be sad  it just means he wasnt the right one you dont need anyone you have the love within you to be all you need all you need to do is bathe in the glory that is you everyday no one is better than you no one is below you  we are all just as confused as you take each day as it comes be it good or bad and get out and spread your sunshine everywhere xx,0
amberlea amberlyn you have some good wisdom i too have survived suicide unlike my brother and now feel the world needs all of us who struggle daily to live our pain allows us to understand others who feel hopeless the fight is worth the reward hang in there there is a great man in your future one who will idetify with your struggles and understand your pain i hope you keep fightingyou are in my thoughts and prayers you are important to me please post and let us know how your doing from time to time,0
hang in there when a guy i loved rejected me i was shattered he had made me sign up for okcupid to see how compatible we were we were a good match but he walked away im glad he did because several months later my now husband started to chat to me yes life is a fight and you will struggle but you are not alone and there are amazingly good things and amazing people who are waiting for you so hang in there and fight because in the end it will be worth it,0
i suggest vipasanna meditation also known as mindfulness meditation for the reduction of anxiousness look up some scientific papers on the subject it works for me,1
im an alcoholic which makes treatment extremely hard i am diligent with my meds but it is very hard stay sober and take meds that dont seem to get me stable or drink that seems to make things ok i made the choice (horrible) to do my meds and its working not saying i dont want a drink but the benefits of just meds has helped me tremendously got a job did well got a car too im doing better but the drugs are harder to fight i wish i could help ,1
it does take time to find the "right" therapist for you you have to be able to trust that person and be able to build a repore a relationship between the two of you sometimes it takes a while to find that right one there is patient/therapist confidentiality if you did anything to this guy stopping short of a felony you shouldnt have to worry about it i found it very helpful to write down my story pour your mind and heart out on sheets of paper read it feel it know that it is you on those pages holding all your anxiety bottled up will do nothing but eat you from the inside out as it is now its ok to see a therapist once or twice and decide if you are comfortable or not they will not take it personally it took me several years to find the right therapist who had the right modalities and approach to really set me free from my issues it may take you some time to find the best fit but dont give up!!,1
ive tried all the write it down and burn it bullshit i hid it for years and functioned for somewhere around 10yrs or so un til something else happened in my life all that happened was a fing diagnosis of ptsd even more meds and extensive therapy and the thoughts of death on tbe daily please just go to therapy now get it out and move on with your life while your young dont end uplike me basically living in a 10x12 bedroom coming out only to exercise your dog and go to doctors appts live a good life and dont end up with social anxiety because of some asshole from the past,0
i think you suffering from guilt and years of keeping a secret to yourself i know exactly what you going through till this day i have not opened up not even to my therapist am also in my 30s and everyday is a trying day its so difficult to exist all the best today,0
it took me awhile before i met people that i trusted with some of the horrible abusive stuff ive dealt with my main issue is i dont like being looked at with pity when i need support youve taken the first step by mentioning some things here over time i find it becomes easier ive forgiven those who hurt me realized it made me who i am i still deal with feelings of self hate but talking about some of what happened to people that are struggling like yourself is easier we are all hurting in some way the best way to move forward is let it go by crying writing about it typing it in groups like this its not a sign of shame or weakness but strength,0
you will only deal with this when you are ready to not before then the only way around the anxiety is head on into it the decision needs to be made as to which is going to hurt you worse talking about it and being brutally honest with yourself and your counselor or letting it continue to eat you up inside who cares what the counselor thinks about it personally you are paying them for their professional advice but it helps to find someone you feel comfortable with in the end you have nothing to lose by talking about it you are the one causing the anxiety to yourself not the event memories only have the power that you give them and truly cant hurt you take a leap of faith i had to and my life is so much better for it you can do it,1
it can take a while to learn to trust a counsellor what i found helpful was writing everything down and taking it to my sessions i have it to him to read and he would pull things out for us to talk about it seemed easier that way they are there to help us so there has to be some give and take oh and have you tried mindfulness for anxiety? there are plenty of resources on line plus apps for your phone it teaches you to focus your energy on anything but the anxious feeling look it up it has been s godsend for me take care,1
i went through a trauma in 2011 and had to wait months before i could actually admit that something was wrong and then open up to mental health professionals about what happened i havent told anyone other than my current mental health nurse exactly what happened to the full extent - and it still haunts me even though ive been through emdr for ptsd - but i have convinced myself over several years to be more open about how im feeling and how things are affecting me if you can find a good therapist or mental health nurse you trust and try to open up to them even if its just a little bit at a time its important to get things off your chest so you dont hold on to all that stress and cause horrible damage to yourself like stomach ulcers and cysts,0
i have a number of mental health issues sever ones ones im not willing to admit publicly but i will say they impact my life greatly and the relationships i have i have sever anxiety amongst them how do i cope? truth is sometimes i cant but i have a beautiful little boy whos face lights up the moment he sees me and runs into my arms who says daddy 300 times an afternoon just because i have him that day just because his with me i live for that i fight all my problems for that i use my little one as my grounding source whenever i get too bad i think if him or look through my pictures of him remind myself life isnt all bad theyre are little things that make it all worth while my son is mine what is yours?,0
all that anxiety you are holding inside of you is a result of you not talking to someone let it out (to a reputable therapist) cry dont hold it in its better than any medication trust me,1
if someone has threatened you call police yes ive been in this situation,0
i took it and it made my hypomania worse i was evil ive had sleep paralysis in the past and its terrifying,1
you can always call a distress line mental health or even go to an er,0
hi yes i have experienced the sleep paralysis on this drug it lasted about 2/3 months on & off the events are so real you would swear on the oath that these events you where feeling or hearing are real the realness is unbelievabley real & increased in severity to the point that i was worried about going to sleep then all of a sudden they stopped & i havent had an episode for about 4 months now but when they are happening it was one off the scariest things i have ever gone through,1
i have been on it for years and same dosage as well and never experienced those symptoms i am sorry you went through thay so scary on do many different levels praying for you,1
i recently started taking this and on several occasions had nightmaresi havent had then since i was a kid so very scary,1
ive been on lamictal and never experienced side effects that extreme/terrifying you def need to get back in with your doc and possibly try another mood stabilizer,0
dont be afraid the demons arent real its just your brain misfiring,0
im on 100mg lamictal twice a day and really took my time building up to 100mg from 25mg my side effects are similar i do tend to "hear" things (not voices) and even with my fan going i still "hear" things i do get paranoid and sometimes i have to get up to look around just for my sanitys sake i also experience something that i can only describe as "evil" and feel like im being watched in my sleep as well as in my dreams i always wake up freaked out and i have to go get out of bed and read a book to help me calm down,0
wish you good health and peace  those were some distressing symptoms ,0
taylor beebe im sorry i suffer as well i guess im in between manic and depression been diagnosed bi polor im so sorryhve took many of their drugs and im on nothing at this time my insides are shaking when im not sleeping as ive had to do without meds for 17 days im tired im so sorry,0
i dont take lamictal but experience those symptoms way too often mine is a case of hypnogogic hallucinations hypnopompic hallucinations & sleep paralysis its very scary to experience but is a result of how my body falls asleep and wakes and is not related to any psychosis this may be what is happening with you too glad you got ahold of the other doctor though i hope the seraquel helps,1
ive been on seroquel for almost 10 years and i love it but the extended release are for the birds makes me feel like i have restless leg syndrome,0
i take 2 mg klonopin and 150 mg of seroquel at bed time and its lights out no side affects but do need to be woken up dont even hear the alarm prior to starting seroquel i would spend days awake then finally go to sleep for like 30 hours so its working for me,1
when i took lamictal and trazodone together i would have terrifying dreams within dreams about being attacked in the middle of the night i never knew when i was awake or asleep,0
same thing happened to me 2 weeks into taking this med i was having horrible hallucinations at night and weird dreams then shortly after i developed a full body rash i didnt know the rash was connected to the medication at first and was misdiagnosed at the first urgent care visit as just having a basic rash later found out i was allergic to the medication and spent a week in the hospital with liver failure my enzyme levels were in the 500s,1
yeah i was warned that theres chances of a life threatening rash luckily that didnt happen to me,0
i think it sounds like you had a sleep paralysis side effect and then you had an anxiety attack because of it when you are panicking you can experience lots of weird sounds feelings and ideas,1
holy wow that is seriously scary ive experienced sleep paralysis once but nothing on the level you have and i still have major insomnia problems,0
ive been wobbling a lot lately but didnt want to admit it felt guilty for feeling low when i have so many good things in my life but it spun into a vicious circle ive got help though so ive broken the circle now,0
without a doubt a dog is definitely a best friend my daft old mutt sensed me having a particularly dark and grim episode and she got up off her bed to come and lie next to my chair while continually looking up at me like she was reassuring me that she was there for me this may sound stupid to some but i for one believe that dogs can sense owners mood and wellbeing,0
yeah i had a look last night such a shame when so many people would benefit greatly from it,0
will be your hero tomorrow as well my baby boy feels what i feel then i feel so guilty then i assure him that mums okay and he can go back being a dog my baby is oscaryour babys name is?,0
cats are very intuitive also mine stays with me when stressed or depressed she is a rock,1
my boy is the same when i have panic attacks i couldnt be without him,0
dont know why you think this is weird to be honest obviously it is going to be hard for her seeing her ex and you together it would be unusual if it didnt make her feel awkward howerver it is really her issue and only she can move forward and accept things you dont say how long ago they were together - im presuming they had split before you and he got together as long as your cousin is not deliberately making things difficult for you both i would just carry on as normal thats really all you can do,0
me myself the self journal helps alot this works on my spin downs keeping busy with even small projects keeps my mind contrasted off lifes coursemind games seem to work when im hipper inside im just learning this candy crush works  also i have been doing a lot of research on different ways of help i am on medications and in therapy of 14 yrs now soi could go on and on anxiety with burst of energy can be used wisely your in the right dirrectionmost wait to long to ask for advice good luck you got this ,1
lithium is horrible i hope it isnt as bad for you as it was me!!! only good thing is i felt normal well as normal as i can after i got off that was a terrible medication experencr for me,0
its horrible out h get with insurance lose your job lose insurance they just passed a bill where anyone with pre existing condition is denied insurance through government our its so expensive we cant afford it im just praying,0
lexapro (escitalopram) has helped me tremendously with both my dpression and anxiety i take 20 mg,1
lexapro worked for me for 10 years and i think the only reason it stopped working was because my life became more stressdul7,1
struggling to its been a long time,0
i hear you honey x struggling myself ☹️,0
has taken me 20 + years to accept this still feel guilty sometimes,0
im going to try and get him to meet with me as well we im south africa if u not on health insurance the waiting list to see any doc is so long im afraid it might be too late i myself am bipolar and attempted suicide for times the fourth i pray was my last,0
take him in for awhile  if he afraid that his parents wont love him become the parent he needs  try to talk to him and communicate if its really horrible call 911 n get him help ,0
ive been on numerous medications also- idk specifics about you of course area dr insurance etc but i had a genetic test done - paid for by insurance thankfully and turns out my "body type" can only respond to 4 types of medication none of which i had tried- currently in trying the third one on the list- and it helps for the most part- the test also told me about interactions with sleeping medication and how actually my body works against them i dont know much about lithium but i know its an option to avoid - anyways genetics testing might be an option for you- good luck -,1
ive been indoors over a year due to people and terrible anxiety id rather someone throw a net over me and drag me out of here ,0
im from australia and get free or heavily subsidised drs and subsidised medication i just cant believe that in this day and age in a 1st world country a person has to worry about withdrawals due to not being able to afford meds it infuriates me im so sorry this has happened,0
if your withdrawing off all of these at the same time them you are going to be in for a hard time its not going to be pleasant and that is speaking from experience i would recommend withdrawing in a facility where you can be monitored as i have anxiety depression ptsd ocd bipolar 1 boardline personality disorder eatly onset psychosis as well as chronic pain fibromyalgia and ive done the withdrawl process in order to change meds and when i wanted to have my son but in all honesty its not going to be pretty please dont do it alone,0
i lost health insurance recently too and it took calling around to 10 different pharmacies to find pricing to where it was manageable for my 3 meds without insurance ive done cold turkey off my meds before and i dont recommend doing it i was stupid and angry at the world and manic at the time and didnt care until withdrawal came when it comes to your meds i would suggest that you see if you can get samples of seroquel if they still do them keep the lamictal and prozac if you can call around to different pharmacies and do a price comparison my doctor stressed in my situation lamictal was important to stay on,1
as many have stated take a deep breath pharmacies can get you in touch with companies that will either get you samples or coupons for discounts if you have a costco in your area they have the best discount program and good prices but check with your state mental health website it should give you links to the counties where you can get free care it will take time to qualify for the aca your area or any state benefits i have been where you are i have slogged through the system and know what to do after 39 years of trial and error it can be very frightening but do not go off your meds!! pm me and i would me happy to walk you through what needs to be done hang in there!!,1
i refuse to get started on therapy to lose it suddenly its a real threat to not have the coverage! there are ways to manage,0
call the drug companies they quite often have a plan that will work for you if nothing else they will reduce the cost of your meds then go to the state and stay there until someone listens to you!!! withdrawals are horrible and if it gets too bad head for the er their social workers usually have someone or something that will work for you god bless my friend ill be thinking of you,1
you need to find somewhere that you can detox safely especially from the klonopin i had a doctor abruptly take me off klonopin did not tell me that i could suffer seizures that could possibly kill me from this withdrawal and the withdrawal was absolutely horrible from what i understand the type of medication is one of the worst withdrawals almost,1
seroquel is going to be difficult for me i had withdrawl symptoms for a couple of months i had horrible itching and had to take benedryl to take care of it klonopin you might be moody for awhile i dont recall withdrawl symptoms off of lamictal same with prozac i dont recall because i was on that too many years ago but i remember i didnt tirate off of it im sorry you are having to face going off of your medications that just really stinks,1
i have depression severe anxiety ptsd and major ocd i havent taken any pills in over 10yrs and cannabis helps me :),1
you might struggle to sleep,1
yeah i just came off lyrica and sereque l dont want to scare u but it was horrible u cant not take your meds u must see your dr they can bulk bill u and the chemist can set up an account for u just tell them your circumstances if not go to hospital maybe there is a social worker u could see if u go down hill u have to be treated good luck hun,0
im on olanzapine was 30mg now 10 as well as lithium and mirtazapine all 3 can cause weight gain ive managed to put a halt and starting to lose some weight 34kg by replacing breakfast and lunch with a diet shake and only carbs 2 nights a week otherwise protein and veg or salad its tough and boring and yes i do cheat occasionally but its all worth it because this is the first time i have felt like im in control of my moods and anxiety,0
i dont know of anyone who has used it either however the psychiatrist i work with has seen it quickly bring patients out of very deep depressions from my understanding you do not run the risk of permanent memory loss with it either as seen in electroconvulsive therapy another treatment option for resistant bipolar,1
i suffer from bi-polar 1 i keep a written list of 101 things i love when im depressed i look at it and try to do one or two things like have a cup of tea or light a candle play with the dog it doesnt make the depression disappear but for several minutes im engaged in something else besides my own mental and emotional misery,0
do they have service animals for people with bi- polar and anxiety disorder having both i feel it could be beneficial,0
you are so right i have basenji mix ! jhe is my heart &suul he lifts my spires & will never leave my side! i have had cronin dep&anxiety disorder this can be disabling all the folks who that have been cried crippled by some opioid that is great ! if you are able to take correctly but some drug cos have pushing like oxycontin so hard &some drs pushing this for 20 years & other similar medsmost of the drs will miss lead by drug companies in1998 i opened a refrigerator and there was a huge white cakewritten across the top was oxycontin in nice blue letters! this is only one in sense my god how can thry sleep! ! after so many lives have been seriously affected by cartliosly huge cos & tricked drs telling them it wasnt sdic sorry adictedingim getting tired taking mrntal health insurance away it should be doubled! !! so il,1
it took me 15 years to even start to come to grips with my illnesses (bi polar social anxiety disorder ptsd and agoraphobia)  for ur case i hope u can learn to cope and come to grips sooner rather than later u have a proven medical condition imbalance in ur brain and its nothing to be ashamed of i was ashamed for 15 years still am but i am making progress as for meds i just always accepted i will be medicated the rest of my life never really had to fight with it cuz i know what im like off them and its not pretty good luck,0
bipolar disorder is a chronic illness & is not curable there will be times in your life where its well managed & there will be times where its unstable like any other chronic illness you need to learn about it; you need to know what may trigger an episode & also the things that help to make it easier to live with [for me] i found group therapy and peer support helped me to realise i wasnt the only one living with bpd and then to accept that to live my best life i had to take some responsibility for staying well it was my job to: ☆nourish my body with quality food ☆take medication ☆exercise regularly ☆get enough sunlight there will be times i can do all of these things & times where i find them a challenge having at least one person who truly gets your illness is imperative; you need to be able to vent & unload when youre struggling & also have someone to prompt you to reach out if youre not coping give yourself time to get your head around it all - mental illness is not for the faint-hearted you will discover you are stronger than you think you are blessings ,0
check your vitamin levels!! vitamin b12 turned my life around!! a deficiency in b12 can lead to depression and mania tablets are available but i get injections because some people dont absorb it properly vitamin d has greatly helped my irritability as well,1
yes to so many of these ideas practicing mindfulness everyday even when i dont have a panic attack lowers the number of days i have panic attacks overall support animals have been a lifesaver for me writing in a journal even things like writing what im upset about onto construction paper using a map pencil and then tearing it up gets some of the energy of it out - an actual physical expression walking yoga or even just stretching and progressive relaxation all help me you can find guided meditations for free on you tube or podcasts and yes deep breathing too and other grounding techniques oh! and yes supplements-wise valerian root and 5-htp are good 5htp is basically tryptophan- the chemical from the turkey that makes everyone want to nap after thanksgiving dinner chamomile tea can be relaxing and the essential oils lavender and cedar wood are both known to promote relaxation/sleep,0
i have bp2 mdd and general anxiety i dont take meds for the anxiety because i dont like the feeling i use breathing teqniques meditation listen to music (like when im on the bus) and some yoga to keep things under control my therapist also has recomended tapping and body relaxation though i havent tried it,1
breathing exercises when you become overwhelmed with anxiety your breathing can become more rapid and if you can control it/slow it you will find yourself calming down some practice visualization to help fool your brain when you become overwhelmed with a situation example: anxious on public transportation while going to work you visualise yourself where ever you feel calm and with practice you can maintain that image easier,1
its really hard and u r very brave i have to struggle everyday to get out of a house oh sweet i lot because of my anxieties so i do feel sorry for you just keep on battling all the best to you,0
weed can make anxiety worse and bring on panic attacks go to your gp and tell them (dont ask) that you wish to be referred to the mental health and you then get medicated good luck and take care,1
put yourself in the middle of good people and let them show you they care if no-one does then stop worrying and start learning you accept you and try to be happier,0
i do breathing exercises grounding exercises i am a rockhound so i take long walks looking for artifacts fossils etc anything to distract my brain from the anxiety,1
i think i get anxiety a lot when im overwhelmed then feel worthless when i get nothing done because im so in my head i think it would help to schedule out your day & go crazy on simple "to do" lists that way you can take your day one step at a time & feel good about the things you get done hope that helps,0
this gonna really sound crazy to some but an adult coloring book and listening to your favorite music it helps me totally takes me out of the situation however i am nedicated and still have extreme anxiety at times my dog also helos walking or plaing with her just find soething to keep you busy,1
i have bipolar i and anxiety which doesnt respond to meds i was introduced to mindfulness and ive never looked back look it up on the internet and there are also apps for your phone its a way of refocusing your thoughts of course if you can get to a psychologist/therapist then that would be great but try mindfulness it has been a godsend,1
yes animals help a great deal there is a product called valerian root you can get it at pharmacies and at gnc helped me some maybe it would help you also try to talk about your feelings with others and try to start a journal hope you get to feeling better soon anxiety is horrific but it can be managed good luck and take care,1
i know someone is going to blast me for this but i started the keto diet sometime back my xanax use has dwindled im not saying this has solved my anxiety problems by any means but it has definitely helped a lot,0
my dog helps a lot hes not a registered support animal or anything but he definitely helps ive also found some of the most random things that help like listening to an audiobook of harry potter helps or i found out that fantastic beasts audiobook really helped because for whatever reason the tone of eddie redmaynes voice is incredibly calming to me (who knew that would be a thing ha) but in all seriousness animals are the best for anxiety,1
if you can i think some form of exercise would take the edge off the anxiety and relieve some depression,1
i wish i could help but i was wondering how i can be able to cope lost everything because of my bipolar disordernow im just struggling to get through everything each day im tired of fighting not sure if i can fight another day not sure if i want to,0
i exactly have this sometimes going outside even for 5mins helps or fun music while i do a small task like unload dishwasher also i dont set expectations for myself at these times because if i cant do them ill feel guilty in addition to what im already feeling!!!!! try tell myself that itll pass and it gets better,0
i always put on an alarm on my phone the name on that alarm is meds other wise i forget half the time just a suggestion,0
candice alexis my aunt has also had this treatment and her memory has been blown she cant drive because she forgets what the colors of lights mean stop go and caution its incredibly scary and she is not even close to the same person with or without depression hang in there! it took years and years of med trial and error i feel ok with the meds im taking now but i hoped for more improvement i guess push forward an keep on keeping on!,1
is ect eclectic therapy? what do u know about it i have severe depression  anxiety  ptsd bpd  bipolar  im starting to get (agoraphobia?) i can barely leave my house without a panic attack im not taking meds atm (i have before but none ever worked so i thought id try more natural methods didnt work and waiting on a referral to try new meds again) i had an aunt get the electric stuff done (i always called it electro shock but its not called that anymore not sure what exactly its called) but anyway my aunt had bad mental health as well and they suggested it so she tried it shes never been the same she cant remember her phone number or bank info n pin numbers  she has bad memory loss and is often delusional about peoples intentions shes extremely paranoid and has very bad self care  this turned me off to the whole treatment and i cant understand why its still used is that not the usual reaction ? id like to know some more information if possible,0
gabapentin has a withdrawal syndrome associated with it though it is denied by the medical community people are sufferings alone without the support of their medical providers all the time the symptoms we suffer are only recognized to happen if they are abusing their medicine i am here to tell you that people taking their medication as directed are suffering horrible withdrawals the clinical trials headed by dr scott rueben for gabapentin/lyrica and 21 pain meds in total was proven in a court of law falsified data and he was sent to prison however his data is still what the fda and the medical community uses as a trusted source suicidal idealization  extreme anxiety akathisia seizures and more your not going crazy you are indeed suffering withdrawals ,0
im sorry to hear of your husbands condition any med change can be scary i also take gabapentin 300 mg 3 times per day when needed for anxiety if you live in a medical state why not consider mmj it could be a quick alternative until he can be seen by a doctor they are using it for ptsd just my 2 cents,1
usually used for restless leg not mental issues va is notorious for mismanagement of mental health issues,1
he might have wothdrawal like symptoms because his anxiety is rising over the lack of med and upset caused by the doctors lack of care seek out a new doctor if possible and report this one,1
it is i was on it for bipolar depression and anxiety it didnt work for me,1
unfortunately i have not heard much positives about veteran hospitals and doctors im sorry youre going through so much im sure its overwhelming for you and the family escalate escalate and escalate for a refill and/or an explanation of the prescribed dosage be clear and let them know they made a "mistake"! ask for a director who the dr reports to and update the dr of your actions they usually hear " mistake" and respond your husband should not have to suffer through this also he might want to contact he general practitioner to inform of situation i wish you luck and a quick resolution ive been in the same situation,0
everyday is a struggle try not to go to that dark placejust pops up ,0
i struggle every day i am getting better though,0
i think that you are really going to have to be straight with yourself!!! sounds like you are in self destruct mode you want so desperately to feel better but then on the other side you do not love yourself or even care if if you live or die you are being pulled in both directions thats such a hard position to be in sweetheart you have to make a pact with yourself!!! you must be compliant with your medication!! what do you have to loose? be honest with your doctor and tell he/she about your non compliance ans see what suggestions they can recommend do you live with someone that can ensure they can take responsibility for them to dispense  watch you take them and monitor your compliance? please try and stick to it have faith in yourself its only up to you to make the right choice! live or die ?? you get one chance at life i know it can suck im in that place right now myself but there are also so many opportunities also to experience joy love happinesss and peace dont waste your only chance at the gift of life :) i know it can be shit and it can also be a wonderful experience too only you can create your own future xxx good luck beautiful girl!,0
cbt has never helped me i have had more positive results from ct/rt or emdr therapy cbt is more or less a "one size fits all" type therapy and is only effective for anxiety and depression (even though it did not help me very much) explore some other therapies and find which one will benefit and address your most prominent mental issues before committing to a therapy,1
theres a nootropic you can buy inexpensively online called phenibut it affects your gaba receptors like benzodiazepines do when i take it my anxiety is gone and i sleep really well,1
i cannot move if i dont take my meds im so scared i go completely off my rocket im too scared to try and not take them and believe me i drink alot im also diabetic so injections as well ,1
if my anxiety isnt really bad i use a decider with essential oils and just lay on the bed and try to relax but if my anxiety is really bad i cant keep still and find it very hard to sleep or relax ive no advise on when its really bad because ive yet to find one x,1
if you have a good friend or family member ask them to sort an appointment for you medication was the only thing in the end i am bipolar general anxiety disorder social phobia stress how i coped initially was by training in cognitive behavioral therapy on a distance learning course this showed me techniques to stop over thinking and how to handle dysfunctional thoughts you can probably go on to you tube and google a session of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety the other thing i used a lot again found on you tube was guided meditation for anxiety or you can get a quick one for panic attacks etc although these coping methods got me through for years i am just the happiest most balanced i have ever been since being on medication i still meditate and use coping techniques and i do battle daily just on a lesser scale enabling me to enjoy i am not so quick as i was before but thats okay good luck you can do it one vital thing also before i go is learn to breathe properly hugs xx,1
getting into a routine of exercise and weight training is extremely helpful no one around here prescribes actual anxiety medication anymore,1
i have bp level ii as well my wife keeps telling me to get out and try to exercise (of course with no luck since depression and stress tell me to just stay inside) to be honest the only advice i can give is: dont do anything (if possible) that could cause you to go into a mania (since manias lead to depression at least for me) and try to avoid any stimulant such as caffeine are you in school? i know for me my online classes really cause me a ton of stress even though i make a mountain out of an ant hill oh and maybe you should try to find a self help website such as mood gym,1
i cope with medication clonezapam i have bi-polar2 ocd generalized anxiety to be honest im not sure how i could/would be able to cope i have been on meds since 2009,1
medication is part of the answer especially with anxiety / depression therapy/counselling/cbt/dbt are also important to explore underlying issues/thought processes,1
i actually wear a amber anklet which i find helps with my anxiety especially whilst driving try it,1
am i the only one who is bipolar has depression and anxiety but takes no medicines? and is surviving on my own? alone?,1
hear hear well done kit i do think that our recovery begins with us if id left it to the doctors id still be in a bad place but by changing my gp (to one who understands ( bipolar & bpd) and discussing my care plan getting myself back on track with her help and advice i really dread to think where id be now its not easy and i do have good/bad days/weeks but i know if im in trouble i only have to pick up the phone to my gp the local mental health helpline or any of my very good friends and someone will help me im blessed xx,0
keeping you in my prayers go to the er if you need to my depression and anxiety got better once i got rid of my cheater,1
its hard to think "future" when youre in a dark place almost impossible ive been there many times!!! call your doctor immediately and see if you can get in asap do you have a support system? if so use them and let them know where youre at mentally i have very little support but the few i have i turn to unfortunately if their not in your shoes they dont completely understand the impact our negative self-talk has on our ability to cope the little challenges are huge to tackle when youre depressed youre going through some pretty "life changing" problems which only quadruples the situation! ive been there and no amount of "positive" thinking can bring you out of this from my experience get help even if its calling a suicide hotline! youre at the beginning of this roller coaster ride and it will and does get better it takes time and education about our disorder i have two children and have seriously attempted suicide three times i panic at thought if i had succeeded where and what damage i could have caused to my children i also went through some major issues during my "dark place" death divorce and a custody battle i ended up in the hospital where my battle and journey with depression/bipolar began its a positive thing that you were even able to reach out to this group in the past i couldnt and didnt please please help yourself and get help now! your in control of how youre story endsget help its out there trust me!,0
hello i am also in the uk and have been through what youre going through except mine went misdiagnosed for a good 14 years - if not from birth (im now 28) after being diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and depression up until august 2016 when id attempted suicide 3 times and id run up £10k in debt in 6 months they home treatment/crisis teams psych decided i had eupd and put me on quetiapine which i reacted badly to (although theyre not a quick fix and i probably needed longer) - i was then discharged back into the care of my gp and referred to a psych outpatients for early access who changed my meds to carbamazepine and added in fluoxetine and i ended up in a&e again with total depersonalisation for a few hours and uncontrollable crying after a strongly worded letter and a move of nhs trusts im finally on depakote fluoxetine lorazepam and zopiclone im still not stable but its only been 2 months i find exercise really helps me but totally understand that you probably arent in control of managing a schedule (as im not most days) i miss the mania im literally waiting for it to come back also set bed time and wake up times are helpful (but im currently either sleeping 4/5 hours or 12-15) x,0
im fed up of feeling tired all the time even if ive had a good nights sleep ive begged my dr for medication again but she says there is nothing that works with eupd yet i keep seeing everyone mention medication on these chat pages i miss being happy ive lost interest in all my hobbies and have to force myself to tend to put ponies everyday i cant sell them as they do help me when im out there (plus my kids would kill me) even my episodes are no longer a high where im bouncing around everywhere i cry scream rock smash up things and self harm to ease the tension the episodes are not as often but when they happen they are a lot worse to the point i scare myself i find it hard to talk to friends famy even my husband so bloke it all up inside ive spoken to my mum before and she ended up crying which made me feel bad as if upset her she cried because she was shocked by what i was saying happens to me so i wont talk to anyone now i issolate myself i wake up every morning and hate that ive woken up i feel low all the time,0
i suff to do i get the racing thoughts and cant sleep i am in my room for the only time i feel about getting back to do something that i want to do i dont get the chance to talk about it with anyone theyre all too busy to talk about it and make a big deal out of it now im going to be going to the hospital and i will be there for awhile my brother call the cops and they are talking about it now im just trying to help myself and my mom is getting worried about this small problem because of my brother call the cops and tells them ive been up since he had to talk about it when im not been sleeping so i am in touch with my life and i am okay well its noting that im not able too fix myself so dont worry about it when you have a hard time with the mood or behavior changes in a manic depression that you are having it feels like hell and you are able to see a doctor go see what happens if you take medicine,0
it took me a long time to sleep last night it was my anxiety ,1
seem is a scary word doses vary from patient to patient and if you are comfortable and coping ok on this dose then keep going! my husband was on these kind of doses and he was stable for years,0
a strong man and a believer of christ never fear anyone he always rise when he fall,0
i would add that there are things that might help some of you like: -holding an ice-pack to your face (a friend of mine tried this and was really surprised it calmed him down) -try 4/8 breathing (in through your nose for a count of 4 out through the mouth on a count of 8) which is really hard i know but if you succeed i think it is impossible to remain in a fight/flight mode humming might work for the same reasons since it is only possible to hum while breathing out -remind yourself that in a way you are causing this panic and so you can stop it you are in control (i do not me you do this actively like "oh lets have a panic attack" please do not get me wrong there),0
i hate the fact that i know some of my triggers but cant avoid theml have to just keep up the exposure as ive been told this is better than isolating myself in fear,0
last time i had a massive panic attack there was nothing around me to cause it my husband and i were watching disney movies on the couch and i was browsing pintrest for diabetic friendly recipes for dinner with my grandparents it was a nice quiet night the panic attack slammed into for no reason my husband was sound asleep at the time but im sure he heard the panic in my voice all i said was his name not even loud just normal volume which usually he wakes up for nothing i could tap dance on his head and he wouldnt wake up but he heard me say his name was instantly awake and getting up i said i needed him to hold me and instantly he was next to me holding me tight while i clung to him didnt say a word til i started to let go of the death grip i had on his shirt which meant i was starting to calm down and then all he asked was what caused it im grateful he will always help me and i can calm down just with him holding me,0
shakir,0
i had an anxiety attack today and not all of those work,1
this is contingent on what the the trigger of the panic attack is if there is one if the source of anxiety is caused by an exisiting phobia there is an establishd and ingrained pattern that is very hard to turn around on the spot without medication i would say just dont diminish the persons concerns and hang in there till its over,1
i battle depression and anxiety a day bipolar i have my good days and i have my bad days its hard to battle mental disorders,0
i to suffer from manic depression & anxiety please keep passing this around,1
idk if anyone else has mentioned this but i stress to everyone if its urgent go to the hospital and there also hospital programs that are outpatient programs in certain places its not just inpatient that is offered so look up the closest mental hospital also in those that are bipolar antidepressants can cause mania and fluoxetine is one also it has been shown to cause rapid cycling in bipolar patients it also may affect adversely the development of the brain in young people as far as the hallucinations psychosis can be part of bipolar but not bipolar 2,1
she is experiencing psychosis let her dr know that you are in an emergency situation & that she is hallucinating & showing signs of psychosis i had an episode of psychosis about 10 years back had hallucinations for the first time it was the scariest thing i have experienced unfortunately i was told (& turned out to be true for me) that once a person experiences hallucinations when in times of extreme stress anxiety etc i start having mild hallucinations at least now i can usually tell what is a hallucination & what is real i smell smoke sometimes ive heard a dog barking in my room but there is no dog hallucinations are not only visual they need to do something about the hallucinations i hallucinated my house was on fire it got to the point that they needed to add an anti-psychotic medication some examples are: abilify geodon zyprexa seraquel & many others most of these meds cause a lot of weight gain geodon has the least affect on weight if you ever need advice or just someone to talk to please message me,1
eh dont worry about it clearly a good portion of people here (at least the admins) thinks there is a one size fits all solution (pharmaceuticals) to mental health problems when of course that is a silly ridiculous notion that needs to be squashed out,0
you need to call her psych & tell them you need an emergency appt although im in australia most psychs will keep time aside for emergencies i know mine does because ive had my own appt delayed due to an emergency also if you cant get her in early enough take her to your local er for immediate mental health unit evaluation in the meantime i dont want to frighten you but with the symptoms youve described she needs immediate care does she have someone who can care for her & be with her all the time? i truly hope you find the help you need as soon as possible,0
i cant fully relate however i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and after a year of being on the same meds they stopped working because i didnt coordinate them with counselling which is apparently what i was supposed to do my meds are switched now and i feel great again and now i am doing counselling so i hope i can stay on the same ones this time my point being after being on the same meds for a year theyre may have lost thier effects,1
nightmares flashbacks panic attacks the list goes on id suggest seeing a dr if u have concerns,0
i know what its like to wake up every morning wishing you hadnt nobody understands unless they go through it it was my little boy that kept me going i could never have left him and the thought of what it would do to him he would have been the one to find me as im divorced and we live alone but i can promise you that it will get better once youve got on the right medication things will change just hang in there and focus on your little one he/she is worth living for like the other lady said  if you feel that you will be a threat to yourself go to a&e your little one needs you and so does everyone else we can beat bipolar and we will!! x,0
i really wish you the best trust me suicide is never the answer especially if you have wonderful kids that need you if your husband cant see what he has then that is his loss and you deserve so much better for you and your beautiful angels recently i have had a family member commit suicide and he had 2 children and trust me when i say that those little girls are going through too much for a kid to handle just wondering why their dad didnt want to be with them anymore life is beyond too short as it is look to god and look into those babies eyes and i promise life will start to fall back together you may be crushed right now but i have severe anxiety and depression and have been there my mom is manic depressive which is a term for bipolar and she gets pretty bad and i have to tell her how much we all love her and would die without her she is my rock! such a strong woman and you too can be that strong! may god bless you!,0
and i know i am a stranger but if you ever need to talk dont be afraid to contact someone the suicide prevention hotline is 1-800-273-8255 available 24 hours everyday,0
if you are at risk of harm you must go to the er its really important the 4th isnt that far away if you can hang on until then can you see your dr sooner? all the best,0
reading this gave me anxiety it is all this to a t,1
lol i was afraid to keep reading like yup damn another one,1
im afraid of the hospice too but do what you gotta,0
did not know that my experience was that it made me irrationally angry pretty much 100% of the time,0
hey if you are starting a mood swing i doubt it is the wellbutrin this fast- it is actually a great antidepressant for bipolar disease i bet you are just starting to swing- the question is will it be the big mania swing or just a mixed state i second denise and kristin- if you need the hospital then just go back and tell them that person is a trigger for you and they will need to help you avoid that trigger,1
just because there was one person having a crisis does not mean that you cant go back there!! it will happen again and it could be you the next time you need to trust the doctors and go back!! welbutrin is ok but if it is sending you into mania that is not ok a hospital stay can regulate your meds to give you some stability believe me i have been there during my last stay there was one woman who was not stable and she was all over the place i just avoided her when it got really bad the staff let us watch a movie in another room so please dont let this get in the way of your health and well-being!,0
yep been there latuda prazosin lurasidone and cannabis no alcohol none not a drop do everything within your power to keep a regular sleep schedule life isnt over but it will be different bipolar 2 mixed/ptsd (military) etc my deep depression is in remission after ect/latuda mania is still an issue but seems manageable most of the time now hospital stays suck i wouldnt ever consider ect again but it did temporarily help the memory loss that comes with ect is horrible you can get through this just dig-in and hold-on for life!,1
the hospital is rarely like that its scary when it happens though i sympathize with that i can relate to a lot of what youre saying hang in there things swing around eventually ,0
honey you do still have the option to go back to the hospital just because you left once (with doctors okay) does not mean you can not go back when and if you need to sometimes its very helpful to be in the hospital for a bit i can imagine how hard and scary your time there was though ive taken wellbutrin before but its been a while if you need to talk to someone like you feel free to private message me ill keep your aninimity,0
i looked at your meds but i dont see you on mood stabilizers! you are yo-yoing! i avoid depression and mania via lithium and zonisamide and i take an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone to shut my mind down from thinking at night and keeping me awake anti depressants can make depression way worse and induce mania mood stabilizers dont do that i would seriously overhaul your regime,1
find a therapist i am bipolar 1 depression anxiety i am on buspar lithium latruda seraquil just started seraquil world of difference in the last month hope you find something that makes you feel better,1
keep trying never give up i was at a point where i was so scared to leave the house i would only go to the mailbox and straight back in the house i had to change my meds about 30 times but i finally found a working combination i still get the anixety attacks but not every day,0
i remember my 1st time in a psych ward security guards were called twice to hold down patients to give them a shot and put them in the quiet observation room i was scared to death and add that onto my psychosis and eventually i was the one held down and shot in the backside and in a quiet room now i have greater control of my own mental health and i am lucky enough to have the option of checking in to a private facility before i get bad enough for shots and quiet rooms i have medication but the thing that really helped me was seeing a psychologist yes we dug up some painful memories that hadnt dealt with like child abuse and rape and a violent father but my psychologist taught me tools that i could use to take charge of my mental illness rather than have my illness control me if you can handle it give it a second chance if they want you to bring up stuff you dont feel safe doing ask them about cbt and tools you can use to help you cope with this illness instead once you build up some trust perhaps then can you start digging i have bipolar i and while im not always stable like at the moment i feel depressed thanks to chronic pain i think im doing ok it can happen you can learn to live with this and be in control it just takes time and a lot of hard work take care and good luck,0
its a long arduous journey finding the right meds!!!! & hospitals can be scary places too! look into genetic testing for what meds will work best with your dna instead of waiting weeks/ months & side effectswe see clients 2-3 times per week & have each patient closely monitored every 2 weeks by their prescriber to keep u stable & avoid hospitalizations good luck heres sum info to start later,1
ive been on wellbrutin as well and think i need it changed ive had depression and anxiety all my life you just have to have faith and yes find another dr you can trust i know its hard but dont ever give up it will get better❤,0
bi polar ii rapid cycling schizoaffective disorder generalized anxiety disorder (with social and agro phobia increasing anxiety symptoms) panic attacks (caused by phobia issues and ptsd attacks) ptsd stress anxiety and panic induced blackouts and functional blackouts i went through a wonderful pletra of meds trying to control the bulk of symptoms and maintain consciousness and to figure out exactly what my diagnoses where its not a pretty road and i am thankful that when i had given up on everything i had someone come into my life and inch and nudge me and build me up to going back and became my voice when i had no words to explain,1
i am also a suicide survivor! i have so many years struggling with bipolar/depression disorder im so glad that you have interests that can make you happy i have yet to find mine and its been along long time since my diagnosis i have found things to throw myself into but they never last at the moment its an irrelevant job one of many ive had its physical so i guess its positive for now i also find therapy a must to work through our complicated minds i only recently found a therapist that i click with prior to her i spent years taking the steps but going no where as of today im sticking with the program even with therapy and meds i believe i need more! i recently inquired about group therapy i need need need to be around people like me and understand from experience im so sick and tired of being "sick" and i cant afford to mess up or make anymore bad decisions! is anyone on this site from michigan?? im all over the place! i just meant to welcome you to this sitewelcome! lol,1
same i dont really get angry tho more like overwhelmed when its really bad for me i feel like it also just sucks the life out of everyone around me and i feel like such a monster that i want to run and hide from everyone the emptiness and depressed feeling can be so crazy when i get into that wanting to end it all state of mind its not that i actually want to end it all i just wish my feelings and thoughts would silence themselves for once ,0
i think ive got a lot to talk about with my doctor! dbt therapy or bipolar? im so confused ,0
its all manageable with dbt therapy but it takes a lot of effort on the patient and a lot of times closes family struggle to understand the illness that i struggle with every day if you are reading this and realize it sounds like you know you can fight it but it takes a lot of work,0
this explains so much! everything is about bipolar/depression/anxiety i understand bpd goes hand and foot with ptsd,1
jason borderline personality disorder bipolar depressionanxietyptsd all have some symptoms which may seem the same this does not mean you necessarily have them also therapy can remove borderline and anxiety but not bipolar or ptsd but improve it immensely and how to deal with it,1
honestly i would ask her about it ive been through this and its a nightmare anxiety and depression affect me as well and you cant just go on not knowing if it blows up in your face yeah its going to hurt but at least youre going to know why shes acting that way i wish you luck and i hope you can stay strong this will pass,0
i had similar experience she and i were close for more than a year but that was it--close yes we knew each others feeling she admitted she loved me but she didnt wanna go further like commitment she told me she had a boy who came to her house almost everyday and her parents seemed to like him she was afraid to hurt me if we were coupled although we didnt have official relationship but it still hurt me i expected too much because its hard sooooo hard to get a girl in a country which homophobic then she suddenly disappeared no trace at all my heart was broken so i think its better for you to make it clear with your girl what do you want how do you feel about her at least you help yourself to get an answer about the relationship between you two i found it easier to go on or even to let her go after we opened our minds and talked about it you need to say how you feel i dated 20 girls (yes i was a player once) and most of them needed certanty about the feelings,0
sounds to me like shes unsure of something her sexuality maybe??,0
this is me and high anxiety ptsd ocd and maybe some bipolar,1
shakir,0
i suffer from depression get panic attacks and anxiety i take medicine,1
april please resist the urge it may feel like a release at the time but in the long run it doesnt heal the pain and the scars never heal please dont do it i will worry about you all night now,0
thank you for reaching out im trying my hardest to resist the temptation but life has come so stressful,0
im having a terrible day angry at everyone been so depressed now for more than 30 days in a row hiding in my bedroom away from people pushing my friends away im trying to fix the urge to cut but fear im not strong enough to keep ignoring the call of the blade please i need help,0
i fight it every day april i only go to work and store because o have to really dont want to leave the house tried so many meds didnt work xanax is helping a little but tried to avoid that drug my next step is to see psychiatrist im thinking try to stay strong i know it is so hard ,0
being angry and full of rage isnt usually part of the manic phase youre angry and irritable because you dont feel good depression gets to you that way while nothing completely takes it away for me there are things that help me take the edge off talking to a friend can help relieve some pressure if you have family nearby hugs and positive statements can go a long way getting outside for a walk and getting a little exercise can help all of that is easier said than done being depressed and holding back anger is exhausting and its hard to leave the house sometimes you may need to consider medication its not a cure but it can help much of the time,0
omg this is totally so so true being out of comfort zone is terrifying,0
i take 6 different medications each day obviously they all differ in amount (mg) strength/type of drug & treatment/reason for which theyre prescribed its not about how many medications you take its about finding the right combination & dosage to level you or to improve your health dont worry about the amount or number of medications your on worry about feeling whether theyre working for you but please make sure to have your lithium levels checked regularly i have mine checked every 3 months,1
i am on lithium 800mg a day and 40mg fluoxetine for my anxiety it goes by the level in your blood not how many mg 06 / 08 is what my dr said the level should be with lithium ask your dr what your levels are and what they should be you seem to be on a lot hope this helps x,1
im a hugger they feel much better than a hand shake!,0
i need one now so much has happened in the last month im overwhelmed,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page thank you hun hugs peace ✌️,1
my brothers 30 and has autism theres no pill for that my darling and no cure just therapy bro and i have lived together our whole lives i know all about it yet i can only speak of what its like to live with an autistic person i cant speak of what its like to have it although 30 yearsive come to know my brother very well anyway with everything else you mentioned a good doctor and medication can make you feel better but not fixed im afraid :-) i have severe depression severe anxiety panic disorder borderline personality disorder avoidant personality disorder type 2 bipolar rls cerebral palsy and im half deaf im a beauty i tell ya lol theres always help id love bro to go to therapy but its hard to explain my brother he wont go,0
theres no quick fix im afraid and medication is not going to resolve all your issues i would also suggest seeing another specialist to confirm that all your diagnoses are correct if you genuinely do have all i wouldnt imagine you would be able to function at all bipolar depression anxiety can all be helped with medication but therapy important especially with depression anxiety and eat i g disorder to identify underlying cause there are no specific meds to treat bpd therapy is most beneficial but bpd can cause associated depression anxiety as above that can result can be treated autism not sure about but dont think so second opinion is my advice though,1
this sounds like me although i was diagnosed with hypomania i take latuda 80mg valium 5mg as needed and 600mg neurontin as needed i dont get the agitation and irritability but still get depressed most days im mildly depressed or just feel flat nothing its not pleasant,0
with the anxiety it concrns me how it effects the heart if i dont take something to slow my heart i think its got to ware out sooner then later from over exaustion,1
cyclothymia is like hanging out for the rest of your eternity in purgatory never going extremely up never going extremely down it causes high levels of frustration and stress and anxiety and it sucks,0
hi this is my second time on lexapro it takes around 6 weeks to get the full benefits though i did feel relief in the first week taking the meds each time at first you may still feel very anxious i was dizzy a tad nauseous and tired the first time and this time this medication has saved my life and family no regrets its been a blessing sorry for your loss and i hope your partner gets relief soon deep breathing helps and check out beyond blue website for other tips and help i have called them a few times and they were great good luck :),1
new meds they say give up top three months to be fully effective however he should start seeing some results within a few weeks i would suggest if his tension and such is high which is understandable maybe find things that might take the edge off while hes adjusting if he likes the gym nature hikes video games drawing a hobby perhaps something to charge his focus from baby even for a moment might help,1
i have lost many friends i only really have one friend at the moment she used to be my occupational therapist and after treatment we became friends she is a friend like i have never had she would do anything for me my other friends turned their backs on me for many reasons 1 they couldnt handle my illness 2 they thought my suicide attempt was just to get attention 3 they didnt really care about me 4 i was putting more energy into the relationship than they ever did i miss having other friends as i dont go out allot as i suffer with social anxiety and bipolar depression so it would be nice if i had more ppl to communicate with and feel supported by but at least i have my folks and my one friend you have to weigh it all out and go from there it definitely isnt easy,0
first you talk about contributing to the conflict then you talk about being betrayed its a little contradictory its a little hard to give advice because it allows for too much speculation and assuming but this is my point of view i have ptsd anxiety and depression mental illnesses run in my family my younger sister has the same issues but also has schizophrenia and borderline personality she is always using her illness as an excuse but she may not realize it i try to give her the benefit of the doubt but i have cut her out of my life she is abusive emotionally and physically and believes that people should accept her just the way she is because thats how she was born i personally think that she should take an assessment of how she is and quit expecting people to put up with being hurt because thats just who she is im not saying this case is like that but without more information i can only go off my own experience it isnt just about others accepting you its about you accepting them as well doing things that push people away is self centered and it may be time to take an internal inventory if you want to be a part of life if you want loved ones around dont use your issus as an excuse to treat people poorly get on meds get into therapy actually care about people instead of only focusing on yourself and how you feel my husband and i have a lot of mental issues and fight constantly i know how youre feeling please understand that im not try to be a jerk just speaking from the experience of someone who has absolutely zero friends,0
me big time! i was doing better but lately it has been rough i think stress has triggered depression to be out of control things are starting to look up but im still having suicidal thoughts because that is what my brain knows,0
that was my entire month last month would just cry for no reason thankfully i had seroquel added with my abilify and ive been doing much better with my anxiety/manic episodes,1
i have an alarm set for my meds i get them all ready for the next day the night before,1
im so sorry im blessed with insurance from working for 32 years for the state it seems there should be some consideration and compensation for those who need their meds makes me ashamed of our country!,0
i was suffering depression and anxiety was at the point of a breakdown it did take a while to work though,1
yes #45 why do you think so many of us are anxious about the future of our country?,0
i mean im all about a second opinion but my actual dr said it most likely is bipolar and the meds seem to be helping  minus the insomnia and horribly vivid dreams,1
absolutely there are many who suffer ptsd from traumatic birth particularly those whose children were born premmie or if there were medical complications for mother and baby before and after birth i dont know where you are but there are a few pages specific to women whom suffer from birth trauma here in australia one such page is called panda (perinatal anxiety and depression australia) you may also have other underlying problems from the type of environment you grew up in,1
i have two autistic sons theres no fix let alone a quick fix autism is to be taken much more seriously than that if there were a fix believe me millions of people would have been onto that a long time ago it does not exist & im not sure one ever will so bipolar & similar disorders are something that are usually developed over time you are born with autism my sons have what is called co-morbid diagnoses meaning they have more than one diagnoses being asd (autism spectrum disorder) gad (general anxiety disorder) & adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) which makes for a very potent mix but they are classified as high functioning meaning they function at a higher capacity than other asd sufferers there are three degrees or levels of function high moderate & low the less a sufferer is able to do for themselves the lower the level of function you need to contact a gp (general practitioner) to request a referral to a specialist in asd this specialist may want to do their own assessment of you to gain a starting point then they will generally become your therapist/gp who will guide you & medicate you if required please remember though there is nothing wrong with you you have the ability to see the world & everything in it differently & who is to say that this is wrong? you are special & i know that you would have skills & strengths that you could tap into like the arts writing or painting to name just a few do not waste ant talent or interest you have this is how asd people function best good luck laurie ,0
wow you are going through a lot arent you unfortunately i dont know of a quick fix autism there is no cure as for your other disorders there may be medication that can help but they may start to notice a difference in a few weeks up to 6 there are some anxiety meds like ativan and xanax that can work straight away but most drs either dont like to prescribe it or only allow you to use it short term because its easy to overdose on it you can build a tolerance to it so you need it more and you can get addicted leaving you with something else to deal with one of the best treatments for anxiety and depression is cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness which either a psychologist or therapist uses you can look them up online there are a lot of examples of things to try particularly mindfulness there are even apps for your phone to help unfortunately this isnt a quick fix but they teach you tools that you need to practice everyday so you have them on board when you come up with a situation or feeling that makes you uncomfortable or anxious i really wish i could give you better news somebody else here might have a different perspective im just going on personal experience i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder and my nephew is on the autism spectrum take care,1
great when you try to go bowling but cant because people are watching and you have a panic attack woohoo! then your boyfriend starts yelling at you and asking you why you arent bowling and you just try not to cry like sorry im like this????,0
its been horrible i feel like ive had the worst ones,0
there horrible,0
i hate it when panic attacks wake me up,0
my son is a comic and at times has panic attacks while on stage i dont know how he does it the audience doesnt ever know but his dad and i see it and feel so helpless for him,0
i wish my so could understand thisbecause there is no physical reason for my panic it isnt realin his opinion anyway :(,0
yeah my anxiety sucks baby,1
i have panic disorder so i get them all the time its the worst whenever i get them at work i have had to work through it so many times one time i was about to just tell my manager that i am going to the hospital because i had heart palpitations going on for half an hour consistently i did not go to the hospital and decided to try my hardest to stay at work,1
oh dont get me started had a severe one a little over a week ago but mine came on for a reason god i was scared couldnt breath in for the life of me sitting on the floor of my bedroom banging my head against the door in frustration to breath its like someones squeezing your heart throat and nose felt dizzy took 30 mins to calm down then i had the after effects so scary and i could not breath infuck man wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy not even my enemies says a lot frightening,0
there horrible xx,0
hello jay settle down if you can you sound a bit panicked how can we make this depression not as bad as the last? the first thing ill share is have what you have and im on mood stabilizers lithium and zonisamide at night these level me out and i get extra rest with an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone in daytime i get up and get 64 colors more like 128 get a canvas with a pre-made drawing on it from hobby lobby and i imagine my depression and i pick colors reflecting it and i then try to depict what depression feels like trust me if youre coloring you cant go lower its melodic and clears your brain and doesnt allow any bullshit in i did this for five days straight and i walked away from the cliff colored in five canvases and got sleep and took my meds,1
maybe stop dwelling on the past ??? stop dwelling were you shouldnt be?? live for today forget yesterday! that seems to be alot bipolar suffers down falls is living in the past love one day at a time and do one thing different each day like shower get dressed  go outside etc every little thing counts,0
not sure i can help but i can empathise im in my 40s and for some reason over the past few years i keep dwelling on the amount of time out of my life thats been wasted because my mh dont know if its getting older but i do find it does become harder to stay positive and not dwell on past especially when things arent that much different but i have actually managed to do some things like join a couple of groups and have met different people which ive never really managed before i plan things ahead to look forward to i think about my children and possibility of grand children,0
i think we tend to stick to what were know because we are scared of change i was in a bad relationship and stayed longer than i should have because id made another relationship mistake sometimes its better to admit a mistake and start again hope this is helpful x,0
good to hear others suffer aswell i struggle so get out the house but once im out i feel better but wow its a battle each and every day,0
i suffer from severe anxiety and depression :-( it sucks sooo bad,1
yep every year for the past few years things havent been great for my depression and anxiety lately anyway for other reasons but were also 2/3 through autumn here in australia winter is just starting to reveal itself here fingers crossed for no sad this year!,1
effexor caused a suicide attempt for me and the brain zaps from withdrawing from the medication were horrible this drug should be taken off the market it only makes things worse in the end,1
no crap like this isnt needed not everyone needs to get ofd it and those that do some end up back on it take what worka dont avoid a medication that may work because someone else had trouble i was on 380mg a day and come off it just fine twice!!,1
dear me all you poor people with horrible withdrawals i was on the lowest dose (i just remember a pink box) was on it for a short time and bang he took me right off because of the absolutely horrendous thoughts and i mean bad bad bad if the thoughts werent going to stop the doc was going to admit me to the hospital because i was dangerous i was on that low a dose i became fine again quickly its amazing how incredibly different each one of us are effexor became the devil in my head i still remember,0
agree listen to doc but it was hell for me too if youve ever seen trainspotting kind of like that brain zaps nausea migraines on and on horrible i tapered slowly under docs supervision and still hell,0
i now have a name for it and its not so scary! i slowly tapered off all my meds about a month or 2 ago and still feel like im withdrawing and get a loud noise in my head and then it feels like electricity i have had only a few good days but it seems to be getting better as time goes by,0
its so good to know someone knows the struggle no one warned me,0
meditation for me i put my earphones in and put on some loud nice music that i like no words just slow music and i to do a little mental procedure of mindfulness getting into my here and now state to me its lining up my energy because when im having a panicked attack or anxiety im all out of whack its your body trying to tell you something and getting lost thats all sometimes if its really bad excersise  controlled breathing umm if im at home a warm shower or 5 min laying down quietly,0
those are all common symptoms of anxiety medication helps many people exercise helps boost medication ensuring you eat good foods and sleep enough helps your body be healthy ask your doctor about medication ask your friends to exercise with you ask the people you live with to help make sure you eat properly and dont sleep all day practicing mindfulness helped me move forward with my illnesses but it works better in conjunction with all of the things ive listed,1
omg i am on seroquel for probly 15 yrs now and i can sleep all night and day + wil but in cipralex and lorazapam im still depressed and anxiety,0
i take serequel but i have to cut it in half it makes me sleep 12 to 14 hours of i get up sooner its a struggle to make myself do anything,1
aw honey im so sorry u feel like this it will get better msg me if you want i have a daughter who wanted to jump off the railway bridge and shes better now i myself have bpd i still struggle but im doing great we can help if you want there are things you can do to help yourself without doctors xxx god bless you xxx,0
i have the same struggles its impossible to function without sleep,0
it isim at the back end of a psychotic manic episode that lasted 9 daysnot 1 hour sleep for 6 days and last night i finally got 4 hours and i can feel im coming down at lastthe 2 things i normally do when manic i tried to avoid doing but failed to stop doing 1 of them and at least i wont hear no more damn voices or see shadow figures moving aboutpeople always think mania is some exciting thing where everything is greatwish they could understand that theres a lot of shit too,0
i worried about my memory and my sentence structure but not sure it is just the meds or whether it is our bodies telling us to slow down and steady up i have found i have to plan and prepare now whereas before i could do anything in the blink of an eye but now if its not on the schedule i get a bit lost think its all the overthinking and hard work catching up,1
i have been on quetiapine for over a decade and have seriously bad short term memory loss im only 34 and my doc is already using words like dementia and alzheimers and doing further tests in that direction im scared stiff xxx,0
im also on both however i attribute my memory loss/poor memory to mental illness because even without the meds i experience it i used to have a great memory but as ive gotten older and my mental health has gotten poorer so has my memory i am 39 and my memory is horrible ive forgotten things ive done or said within the last hour it sucks,0
jessica white you should definitely read up on the topic most of the articles and studies that i have read show a direct link between bipolar disorder and dementia apparently people with bipolar disorder have an increased risk of developing dementia i am diagnosed bipolar 1 ocd ptsd w/anxiety disorder and adhd my brain is a mess lol all kidding aside i have also read up on all the medications i am currently taking and have taken in the past medications i need to functionto keep myself alive well many of those medications have unfortunately also been linked to alzheimers and dementia with all this information i would have to conclude that both our illness and medications are slowly wearing away at our minds our memory nothing can function at full speed forever without experiencing some sort of wear and tear some sort of damage even the best and fastest computers eventually start to slow start to become overwhelmed with data start to stall become full stop taking in new data until eventually freezing up and denying you access to the data you did have i think of the brain in the same way with bipolar disorder or anxiety for example comes the whole mind racing symptom our mind refuses to shut down it just doesnt stop just think of our minds as a computer sucks right? educate yourself dont fixate on it knowledge is power even if we only retain bits and pieces lol,1
im 39 as well i wonder if my memory issues are related to bi-polar as well but with a history of alzheimers in my family i worry about that to and when i say worry i mean fixateto the point of exhaustion,0
its draining  i find that exercise  eating properly and just not being afraid so speak your mind helps a lot  im a nurse and sometimes i feel like ill upset someone and the truth is ive learned that anxiety can be treated my simply just eliminating toxic people in your life and appreciating the positive people in your life  family  friends coworkers and people you trust,0
life is precious marlene  i have a gratitude journal which i fill on my worse days  helps to break me out of darkness  i suffer from both anxiety  depression and extreme lonliness on my worse days ,1
i have both and its horrible,0
i had a miniature poodle who knew when i was struggling and would be there for me now we have cats and one of them is very clingy with me he sits outside my bedroom at night waiting for me to wake up and hell come in for cuddles the minute i sit in the lounge room he jumps up and wont leave me be most of the time i appreciate it lol animals can pick up on moods emotions and illness they are very special like that,0
remember everyone has a different response to medication we all are biologically different thats why different medications are made i have read the posts below that said effexor was horrible for them for me it saved my life no side effects i am 48 and am bipolar i have taken it around 7 years the important thing if you are bipolar is that you must also take a mood stabilizer such as lithium or lamictal with it or you will go manic taking any antidepressants by itself best of luck!,1
effexor gave me horrible side effects i now have lasting tremors because of it,0
it also did awful things to me i wanted to kill myself i have never felt that way before i was hysterical all the time i was so sick and had severe panic attacks and nightmares,0
i do understand being with bi polar and depression and having the server anxiety so on any level my friend being alone is just where i have found myself even having so called friends living in same town everyones body of course is different and well we are an experiment " bunny" when it comes to medicines i have learnt over my 16 years of being bi polar if after 4 weeks on something and im worse in any form (on which no one knows your body and mind like yourself) then i switch i refuse to suffer for months like i have before i am all ears to just listen sometimes thats what we most need,0
wellbutrin is actually really bad for you its in the same category as neurontin and lyrica horrible horrible drugs,0
listen to me there is no fucking shame in getting medical help medicine is good for you it can help you and it can help prevent another break down therapy can help but if you wont break your pride to try then youre on your own naturally being wise enough to get help is the best way to go think before you act,1
well thats a shame because the forbidden topic is the only thing that has effectively treated either my depression or my hypomania too bad we cant gain support for the overturn of unjust laws that keep medicine from people who need it,0
cannabis isnt taboo!!! its the only thing that has ever helped my depression anxiety and my migraines i went from 5 pills to no pills spread the truth stop living in fear!!! you asked for peoples opinions so we can help others its time others know there is an alternative to shoving pills down your throat that has side effects 3 miles long you want to help people but you want to censor us? #endthestigma its not illegal to simply discuss cannabis,0
julie and everybody in general: "chemical" or "natural" it doesnt fucking matter - max has a point many of us would be dead or non-functioning or leading much more miserable lives without that "little pill most people swallow" it doesnt matter that those pills have been "refined by man" - much of our food our healthy food is refined as well a lot of stuff has had something done to it that doesnt make it bad or unhealthy or "unnatural" so i suggest: 1 doing what works for you as an individual 2 shutting the fuck up trying to advise others how to deal with their mental illnesses,0
meditation is helping me with depression and anxiety,1
<tl;dr> read about neuroplasticity change your habits change your habits research about neuroplasticity and how you can "rewire" your brain unfortunately theres no single method to get rid of depression ive tried increasing the intake of food thats high on antioxidants (even tried oil pulling hahaha) exercised meditate etc i have not tried psychotherapy though as my main pdoc says im not ready yet (still on clonazepam for my anxiety and sleep problems) what might work for you will not work on someone else so - its more on experimentation when im depressed (which is more often now i cry and let myself feel the pain and hollowness) <trigger> then i really think hard why im sad why i feel that way most of the time i cant find the answer so - im there crying for no apparent reason its so ridiculous i find it funny sometimes i dont think about suicide but death sounds inviting sometimes </trigger>,0
staint johns wort is all natural it helps both with depression and anxiety but if you are on meds please ask your doctor first,1
the number one thing that helped me was becoming a fur - parent i adopted a little silk maltese at 10 months oldhe is my rock ♡ on another note: i take onnit unsure if you would call it natural or not but the mood onnit really helped me out a lot i can actually sleep at night solidly,1
i smoke cbd oil in am e-cig to help with anxiety when i have to go out and about cbd oil is perfectly legal and is sold in little bottles in some ecig shops it really does help me x,1
*note to admin* cannabis is not illegal in every state and most states have medical marijuana but if you wanted any honest opinion of mine cannabis is better for anxiety and ptsd just saying,0
cbd has helped my husband who suffers from tbi ptsd anxiety and depression plus he cant overdose on cannabis nor are there any real negative side effects oh and he can still fully function and does not get a high at all go natural medicine!,1
elegancein crafting i feel the same way im very happy that you found a medicine that has improved the quality of your life that is what matters! no shame in that!,0
yes!!!! heather welch lol people dont realize that we make change by talking about things openly and truthfully im so tired of the cannabis shaming i havent been able to do anything even leaving my apartment except once a week for therapy for 3+ years since ive gotten prescribed cannabis for my pain depression anxiety etc guess what? i went to the empire state building i have been able to go to eat at a restaurant among a few other things i havent been able to do in a long time or at all before and guess what? its all because of cannabis it annoys me so bad when people dont look at actual scientific evidence before making statements i feel like its a personal attack on me every time smh,0
legality is no reflection of morality im irritated by this as cannabis has saved my life many times and is the only thing that has ever worked! i prefer nature at least i wont die,0
so then for those of us that do live where it is legalized for medicinal usage and that is all we use does that mean we are excluded from making suggestions or even speaking about to anyone on here or perhaps even others who do? i think thats a bit unfair and it was an incorrect limitation put on the subject/topic matter because there is some value and worth in medical cannabis and just to say why i boldly questioned the limitationi cannot take the chemical medications anymore 20 plus years of doing so as prescribed i now have brain damage due to professional medical treatment i have brain damage i also have brain deterioration i also have tardive diskenesia i gain health issues that were never there because of chemical medications my heart stopped long enough to be declared legally dead but somehow im still here so what about folks like me? do i not have any valuable suggestions because the best suggestion i have with any valuable worth is medical cannabis? i didnt say just cannabis because that would be implied recreational use and thats not what its about it may not be federally legal but according the laws of the states who have passed itits legal my certification says its legal my medical cannabis id card that is state regulated and must be renewed and re-evaluated yearly says its legal the fact that i can sit on my porch and have a county sheriff on the other side of the driveway at someone elses house sees me sitting on my porch smoking it and he smiles nods his head says how are you? gets in his vehicle and drives away while im still on my porch have a toke or twothat also saysits legal so i do beg to differ on your statement that it isnt legal and if you dont like my statements kick me out of the group why? because the entire world should have a toke and chill out on cannabis it also helps me focus it helps my muscles and joints relax and have less tension i also have tourettes syndrome ive had it all of my life it helps my tics because it helps me to relax stress exacerbates my tics even internal stress due to other health issues as well it helps me to deal with severe ptsd issues otherwise i may hurt someone because ive been triggered in a bad state ( i dont want that nobody else does either) helps with my anxiety it calms me down better than an addictive chemical like adavan or xanax or a painkiller which only make me sick which exacerbate all of my health issues more i have so many more health issues than i can list here and so many environmental things right down to the barometric pressure in the air and even that can be quite a task to deal with and manage through it helps me sleep i have been diagnosed with insomnia since i was a kid it helps me to have an appetite i dont eat when im stressed problem is with my internal issues (health issues) and environmental issues that affect my internal issues and ultimately become a vicious circle right back out of me i have a toke or two i calm down and i get hungry i cant eat when im stressed or under stress i get sick and throw up everywhere how about migraines? medical cannabis helps with migraines do you understand what im getting at here? if i continued to take the chemical medications having stopped for my life in 2011id be deadwhy? because of chemical medications that professionals shoved down my throat im 38 years old and i feel so broken and incapableid rather not be breathingat allbut i have people who depend on melike my kidsand my partner who is also disabled but ive take a toke or two and im so much more pleasant an enlightened happy loving caring mood i enjoy my kids and their energy i enjoy my partners horrible humori can laugh instead of wanting to break down and bawl and wonder when the next big crash is coming it might not be right for everyone but to exclude people from talking about it or even referencing it because its a worldwide page and its not legal everywherewell thats no different than most of us have experienced in our livesbeing excluded for this or that or the other thing oh excuse me while i eat an entire brownie and get some well needed sleep and wake up feeling okay instead of taking a pill that makes my heart race when i already have gained heart issues from those professional prescribed chemicals several of which put me in the er had i not gone to the er each of those timesmy heart would have beaten itself to my death and exploded in my chest so please tell me if the chemical medications dont work for me but medical cannabis does? does that mean i have no valuable input? does that mean i have nothing to contribute because it will be deleted? go ahead delete it delete me too i find the lack of ability to allow for inclusion is mighty sad you knowbeing gay can get someone killed in other countries its outlawed in some other countriesshould i stop being gay where i live when i can do so legally and freely simply because its outlawed in other countries and not legal? sorry i dont think so you know what else? here in the stateswe drink coca-cola as a soft drinkthey sell it as cleaner in other countriesyou can find it in the household cleaner sectionnot here you find it in the soda isle but far be it from me to say anythingwho am iim a medical cannabis patient and i know nothingapparently,0
i have an emotional support dog he was my dog for 4 years then i got really depressed and so i noticed he really helps me when i dont feel to great he cuddles me licks my hand( i know gross) he just tries to make me happy and it really helps so i registered him and he was trained to sit come shake high five give kisses and go away already because of his age and working with him a lot i highly suggest it for anyone with depression or any anxiety he helps me with both hope this helps,1
my pit bull is my emotional support dog im able to focus on her and not all my crazy worries when were out together shes not registered so were limited on where we can go we do pharmacy drive thru starbucks sonic for her ice cream treat walking at the park and visiting the pet stores,0
i think it depends on where your depression is coming from if your brain isnt able to produce certain hormones/chemicals on its own a nice walk in the woods wont help medication is the only way to replace those things then think of it like diabetes - if your body wont produce insulin on its own itll need help with that if its coming from stress a trauma or something similar natural ways like relexation techniques talking therapies etc might help depending on how open your mind is to those things,1
life inside a bi-polar mindwe talk real closed group i help admin i love pot! read great for ptsd anxiety and bi-polar! lets be real its on the cover of freaking time magazine mainstream america be real!!!,0
i agree with tara except i avoided weight gain by changing what i ate and walked a lot,1
in general in bipolar you take a mood stabilizer like lithium or tegretol or lamictal or a few others ones then they tailor the other meds to where you are in a cycle and the anxiety that you are experiencing yes clonazepam is for anxiety but is addictive so be careful with it i just started buspar which seems to be helping my anxiety and is not addictive,1
i take klonopin for anxiety however i take a higher dose than most although my dr keeps close tabs because it can be addictive i also take lithium lamictal seroquel and vraylar for the bipolar rapid cycling,1
firstly you have to be honest with your partner yes you are supposed to be honest anyway but who really shows the ugly side in the beginning right? im not saying tell the person on the first date but if you see its going somewhere sit down and have the "talk" as we all know bipolar is hard to understand and people tend to take your moods personally i printed out a lot of information for my husband but it was still hard for him to get that i wasnt angry or upset with him normal relationships can be difficult its twice as difficult if you are bipolar i stuck with my motto of "if ive done my best to educate you and you still want to use my condition as a reason to leave dont let the door catch you on the way out" hard work determination and patience is what it comes to its been 6 years and we are still strong so it can be done,0
sorry i dony understand anxiety,0
i wna talk but im embarrassed and i dont think that people wna hear my story cos everybody got their own problems,0
i cannot recommend mindfulness enough for anxiety it takes practice and may not be a short term fix if you are already anxious but when you have a moment where you can focus do some research on it it has been a god send for me i also keep a journal of my moods it gives me some insight how my moods are and if they are starting to get out of control trying to do things that give you some control over an illness that tries to take so much is a really big help if you can see triggers or patterns you said summer had been a trigger pattern then you might be able to do something different to try and help the situation all the best,1
sorry to hear this! look into using therapeutic grade essential oils such as plant therapy or young living oils they help with a bunch of different things- anxiety sleep pain etc good luck!!,1
im on all types the only thing that i have to stay away from is ativan it made me so tired that i was late for work anyone that knows me knows that since i have anxiety i fear being late so i get places an hour early that really screwed me up i take xanax which is not the best but works the best for me i get a little tired but not near as bad as when i was on ativan but i would definitely try your options because everyone has different side effects from medicines good luck finding something that works ❤,1
im on 1200 mg lithium for mania and 150 mg trazodone for sleep/antidepressant daily and lorazepam (name brand ativan) as needed for anxiety everybody is different what works for one wont always work for another also depends which end of the spectrum you fall into as to which combination of drugs will work be patient tell your doctor whats happening as you get it sorted out side effects will vary as well whatever you do dont stop taking meds once youre on them without talking to your doctor first it could make the situation worse good luck to you hope this helps,1
my winning combo is lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder remember what works for one doesnt necessarily work for another and it may take time to find the right meds it took me 18 mths of trial and error,1
top bipolar med is lithium some others are abilify seroquel  lamictal and saphris(personal favorite) a lot of anti psychotics like geodon are also prescribed for bipolar disorder if the depression is a main concern they may add on a med specific to depression such as zoloft or prozac clonazepam is also known an klonopin which is a benzodiazepine (helps anxiety almost immediately) works wonders for sure,1
believe me i am not trying to outdo you but when i was diagnosed it was easier to say what i didnt have then it was to say what i did have white sent me into early retirement even the judge was surprised i didnt break down sooner because i had long work history at one job one of my disorders is a social disorder that is very devastating when im around a lot of people and more so when i dont know them i do push myself to try to tolerate as long as i can when i go to town i only go once or twice a month sometimes a third but not very often because being around a lot of people send me into a anxiety panic attack then my blood pressure goes out the roof yes mental disorders can kill if one is not careful because of the stress it puts on one person but like the judge said he knew that didnt happen overnight and could not see how i lasted as long as i did one of the other things that happen i had a complete nervous breakdown and to close cause of having two more when my therapist got me into a group she said i should have been hospitalized but i did not have the money or insurance and was laid off from my job i dont blame my xbox for doing it because i was not only a danger to myself but to other coworkers thats been 12 years ago since able to hold a job since then ive not been able to work a regular job ever again because of the anxiety panic attacks this next part is not for everyone 7 years ago i was faced with a dilemma i do not know how my therapist worked it out but all i had to use is my government insurance to pay for it but a year after i got out of the group home and my therapist at the time retired with the new replacement i was being charged by the doctor therapist and nurse and also have to pay for my medication i could pay out of pocket and only cover two or maybe even three but not all because the insurance will only cover so much and the rest had to come out of my pocket that i did not have because ssdi does not pay a whole lot out so i had to come up with another solution to the problem with guidance of a doctor that i did not have to pay i wing myself off the medication and start using vitamins herbs and oils that has worked for me for the last 7 years but like i said before this is not for ever one and just like the medications it was a trial and error before i could find the right combination that works for me so i suggest to anyone that is wanting to try this research it out first and talk to your physician about it before starting even though i am doing self-medication natural stuff one still has to be carefull because the wrong combination can be more devastating than the problem itself so research it out if you are thinking about and talk to your doctor too,1
well u kw michael not only does tha seraquil help me sleep but it is helping with my anxiety major depression & my bipolar!!! i love this medication finally after years of going through pure hell & i do mean "hell" i feel like there is hope & a very bright light at tha end of tha tunnel ,1
i had that for years too but it would not help me sleep they just help with the anxiety and panic attacks i have multiple disorders and believe me i understand everyones situation here and i sympathize with each and every one its no cakewalk,1
karen yes you go to bed you cant sleep because your brain just doesnt stop weird thoughts etc it is the lack of seratonan it is an easy fix seraquil/ quetia replaces the seratonin in your brain as i have become older more stressed im taking 2x100 mg a night years ago when you get what i call the heeby jeebies in the morning (anxious shaking sweating) i used to take a tab then to calm myself i cant understand why you havent been prescribed the correct medication to address this alsosunshine helps winter is the worst time for depressants seasonal change & anniversaries of previous triggers will also determine your state of mind,1
ask your self what you benefit by going over it again and again then replace those thoughts with all the great memories you have and all the people and things your grateful for you will feel much lighter because dwelling on the negative will only bring you down further but drawing on good lifts you higher love you because your good and im grateful mick introduced you to me im lucky to have you in my life xx,0
bahaha! how can you love someone you havent met yet? i mean you can love the idea of it but until you hold that baby in your arms and it smiles its little gas smile at you have no idea your stressed and that is normal for a soon to be dad and it is more than likely effecting you you should let your doc know what is going on you should also give yourself a break lay down with your lady and tell her you love her and rub her feet i repeat rub them feet lol get some coco butter and rub her belly (showing or not) show her you care that way and shrugg off other opinions stress seems to be your problem and worring over rather other people think you are feeling the right way about it will only make it worse just my humble opinion,0
i set an alarm on my phone,0
we do a pill box as everyone else has stated you can also set alarms on your phone when to take them as a reminder if you have someone close or a spouse set alarms on both phones so if you forget or miss it someone can tell you or call to remind you hope all is well for you,1
i use a dosset box and set an alarm,1
if you have a mobile phone set a daily alarm x,0
i worry where to get a job so that i could buy those sleeping medicine stop me from getting out of the house going to places just by walking it hurts my feet if im inbed not taking my own meds my hand moves like someones waking me up and id see shadow if i get out it follows me and i could see other stuff and i could see a lot of shadows not just the one who follows you maybe becuase television news shows a lot of crimes and horors if im awake im at the bakeshop im hungry so i eat bread and one making the bread is handsome i wish i have money if i dont have meds i just get out and look for food to eat,0
you could also use certain alarm clocks on your phone that wont stop remembering you until you scanned the barcode of the packaging the medication comes with or a photo of the packaging you need to get up grab it and scan/take a picture of it so you cant accidentally snooze it again and again and then forget of you just stopped the alarm or actually took the medicine while doing that,1
the one i use is called alarmy you can set it to "end alarm by scanning barcode taking a picture or my shaking your phone a set number of times" :) i have to shake mine 50 times twice in the morning so i actually wake and get up nora kale,1
the best to avoid missing a dose or double dosing is to use a pill container,1
alarm or pill box,0

pill organizers work for me or setting an alarm on your phone so you take it at the same time everyday,1

yes i have take care of yourself first and always degrees can wait your well-being is much more important dont feel you have to do everything at once because that is what others deem normal sometimes taking time off helps clarify which direction you want to go in your studies and possible career dont feel pressured to do thing on other peoples time table not everyone does college in 4 years or all at once please care for yourself first always ,0
yes i have high anxiety being around people especially people my age as i have always been teased and treated like crap but i found that online courses work better for me because i dont have to be in a classroom and i can do the work on my own time as long as it is in on time if you are looking for a good website that offers basically any class u can possibly think of there is one called coursera i believe its coursera com or edu or org but i know its coursera hope this helps xxx,0
i was forced to take time off because of my anxiety ive always been a person that is determined to power through my anxiety no matter what but it got to a point where i couldnt even sit in a classroom without feeling like my throat was closing up the breaking point was one day when i got to class but absolutely could not go into the room i walked the hallway a few times trying to make myself go in and i just couldnt so i stopped going to that school and went to another where i could take online classes taking time off in order to better yourself is never a negative sit back and relax and go back to college when you can its better to take the time now then to convince yourself nothing is wrong and have the same things happen when you get into the workforce ive been through that too and im telling you its not fun best of luck were all here to support you <3,0
i unfortunately dropped out of college i had anxiety attacks everyday my teachers werent accommodating at all they basically told me to choose between my education or my health i chose my health it was for the best i can always go back,0
right now im completely overwhelmed im a perfectionist on top of everything else and with exams and projects due leading up to finals im having a rough time i can understand needing time off im only taking four courses i have no idea how people can do five,0
i took some time and almost dropped out but managed to struggle thru in the end i have however been off work for over 4 years due to mental health issues so i can understand your struggle do what is best for you,0
yes ive taken time out of class ive also only studied part time so that i dont overwhelm myself,0
ive taken time off from everything in life because of mental illness including anxiety and i guess depression and other things,1
had a major panic attack missed several classes until i could cope,0
yes i took a year out at uni then ended up doing my degree via ou that was many years ago its not a race if you need time its nothing to be ashamed off since i started working ve also been off sick on several occasions in some instances for months i know im probably quite fortunate working for public sector (nhs) and if i worked in private i probably wouldnt have the job i have,1
im afraid to start keep thinking i wouldnt be able to handle the pressure,0
i have a pill box with morning noon night compartments for the week i fill it every sunday i then have an alarm set in my phone that reminds me and i just go to that day and times compartment its about setting routines it works really well for me i havent stuffed up my meds for well over a year,1
im lazy so i just turn my pill bottles over like an hourglass right after i take them sunday is my start day so on monday they are upside down tuesday they are right side up and so on then if im unsure if ive taken my meds i just count back to sunday and i know whether the bottle should be right side up or upside down and then i know if i took my pills,1
pill dispenser pack! it makes it so easy to just look at it and see if youve taken them already just set an alarm to remind yourself to refill it,1
reminders on your phone/check list/ alarms ,0
not everyone is comfortable with talking about how they will with others all the time who is telling you that you are not showing the right response i dont think there are any its natural to be worried especially if you are a sensitive person you are also quite young and having a baby is a big responsibility its normal to be excited and looking forward to something yet at the same time be worried about things it probably would help to find someone to talk to but not because someone is saying you are not behaving how they think you should but to reassure yourself,0
or give you ptsd anxiety problems clinical depression dissociative identity disorder etc,1
my heart got really2x nervous when my grandfather got a heart attack my father stops buying the meds for me because i cant get up early because of my meds and i am not getting pregnant and i have 1 unsucessful pregnancy my family took me to the mental hospital and i took what the doctor prescribed i told the nurse i might be pregnant he did gave me pregnancy test but was negative but i can feel it in my tummy onetime one tablet and its gone hallucination halograms i dont care about it it can kill mental hospital has the old few clothes patients has no money and are raped and abuse and crazy dirty its so poor im so ashame im one of them,1
going on 67 years and still alive by grace of god its in remission mostly because of my age and help i got for myself earlier in life i live alone content peace and calmness still anxiety and other damages i can live with it now look at myself finally in the mirror that was hard for me for about forty years god be with all of you,0
the struggle is real! were survivors and fighters to face the mirror and still do what we gotta do,0
im 17 years old and have struggled with different mental illness for years and it may sounds hard to believe but until my birthday last year i truly believed there was no feeling better at all with the right people around you and hard work on your behalf there are ways to ease the pain ive found more useful coping techniques from doing my own research as opposed to relying on counsellors and therapists that are only available monday to friday 9 till 5 understanding more about your brain chemistry and why youre feeling the way you do has a greater impact in how capable you feel in managing it weve got it really tough and dont let anyone tell you otherwise its hard enough with hormonal changes going on without added mental illness keep going it will ease with time ,0
it doesnt get better but it does get easier easier to accept yourself and to not let it bother you so much dont let this disorder lie in the forefront of your mind either just take your meds and live your life the best you can every day dont worry people worth it will stick with you no matter what youll get to realize what starts that roller coaster as time goes on it doesnt really stop it but gives you time to talk your way through it or take the charge cards and give them to someone else before you run them up on a grand spending spree!!,0
the reality is life is hard its how you respond to what happens that makes or breaks you not every day is a good day but there are plenty of good days ahead decide what drama you are willing to deal with let go of the situations and people who bring nothing but negative energy in your life do you have a family or friends who love you??? i am a mother who lost her son to suicide he was 20 im telling you this because the pain you feel that makes you think you should end your life is the pain your loved ones will feel forever if you do and if you have a mom who loves you and you take your life you sentence her to a living death so please reconsider!!! you were given a life to live take care of yourself dont try to fix everything at once when you have moments that seem too hard light a candle watch a good movie read the bible or another good book listen to your favorite music until it passes if you have to get a job try to get into something not so stressful learn something new every day volunteer at an animal shelter if you can get a pet go for walks go for a swim find someone to talk to that you know you can count on but stay in this life its not always fair and the hard times seems to go on forever but they dont there is good in this world and its worth fighting for,0
hi i found out i had bipolar 2 at 14 i wish i could say it will just get easy all of a sudden you will get better when you try getting better give every treatment a fair go and be willing to try if 30 year old me could tell teenage me anything it would be take all the help they offer i wish you all the very best and dont be afraid its a blessing and a curse my inbox is always open if you need another bipolar lifer to talk too we need to stick together!,1
i have had bi polar all my life i guess i was born with it but yes we need people in the same boat so we can all be their and listengive advice and empathy cause we understand each other where the so normal people dont know and dont understand and they are frightened of something they dont knownor understandthank you rebecca*,0
yes it will get better the times of hormonal changes are always super hard being a teenager makes ya kinda bipolar anyway!!! my best friend was diagnosed and medicated from 15 until just a few years ago i worry about her not taking meds and im not saying youll get to that point but shes not had a major mid swing in about five years five years!!! depression keeps you from seeing hope but its still there,0
coming from someone that was diagnosed at age 13 and have lived with my mental illness for the last 27 years for things to be easier take the time to learn your triggers and ques dealing qith bipolar or any mental illness is just the same as recovering from substance abuse or addiction i speak first-hand of this as my life was in turmoil for the better part of my life when you can spot your triggers and ques you can begin to circumvent and stop the issues from pulling you back into the depths i pray this helps you hi my name is rob i am a mental illness sufferer and drug addict,1
pip welcome to the rollercoaster called bi polar the ups and downs some days you dont know which way is up i was undignosed through my childhood finally went in myself and i have bi polar 2 with borderline personality disorder but i dont let my illness define me yes ive been through the gammot of meds doctors who dont want to help me but if there is one thing through all these trials i have learned is people with mental illnesses are some of the strongest people i have ever met we fight against ourselves on a daily basis just to survive i know your young but that means you have a fighting chance to change your life it will be a struggle some days will be impossible to get out of bed somedays youll have so much energy you will feel like tigger! but if you ever find yourself in that dark hole where it doesnt look like there is a way out make your room as dark as possible turn on your favorite music sit on the floor close your eyes and breathe i promise it will help good luck pip and remember we are all here for you you are not alone in this fight,0
you have a lot going on right now between the bipolar and teen adolescence one positive way to look at this is that you were diagnosed early so you can develop the right coping mechanisms that will hopefully help you live a good quality of life as an adult so to answer your question yes there is a good chance for things to get better i am sorry that you are having a hard time right now there is nothing wrong with being upset and your feelings are valid dont stop with therapy and medications you got this! better days to come for you! cassandra :),1
everybody is diffrent on their path through bipolar you get stronger as you grow and i realised its not my fault which is a much better place to be once you get there after all the doubt and self blame my focus now is art therapy which is so amazing and less intrusive than 1 to 1 talking the ability to express how you feel instead of running over all the negatives about yourself setting yourself goals in really small pieces even if its tyding one shelf at a time a journal is good my challenges are to stay on meds and keep healthy the meds will probably change as you get older as they find ones that work better for you the depression is talking when you feel everyone would be better off without you this does get easier just remember you are worth being looked after and deserve a good start in life worrying about you is natural for your parents to do it would happen even if you didnt have bipolar take care xxx,1
i was 16 when i was diagnosed now 32 i find its always a roller coaster! if you know your triggers that can help a little to avoid things from getting so "bumpy" i had to stop all alcohol which i was just a casual drinker once i became of age but i got into bad manic phases from that then your lows randomly stopping my meds made everything worse but then having my first child while i wasnt under the supervision of a psychiatrist was the worst! i got postpartum psychosis!! that was a nightmare but i then found an amazing doctor i was later stable and had a second baby and it was if my hormones shifted my whole brain into a state of stablness id never had before!!! anyhow life isnt always darkness or pain there are good times but this illness is a beast! and we do have to continue to fight it! having a great support system great trusted doctor or doctors is key as well! but there are good and great days in your future but just remember it will be a roller coaster! dont give up! dont give in! i hope it gets better for you soon!,1
i was diagnosed at 13 here i am at 21 and still struggle most days i live for the good times though i barely see anyone anymore but i take my down time to enjoy myself i take walks listen to music go volunteer or sometimes just go get something sweet its a fight everyday but the good days are the ones you look forward to,0
hang in the there sweetheart! it does get better! i was 13 when i was diagnosed with bipolar i am 32 now with a husband that loves me beyond measure and 2 beautiful children i take medicine every single day of my life i do therapy as needed and i ask for help when i need it its nothing to be ashamed of dont ever let anyone tell you different embrace the unique beautiful person you are and run with it if you ever have any questions or need to chat youre welcome to message me pip mcgivern!!,0
the meds helps you relax and not make you laugh bieng bipolar and having the medication changes my life but im struggling to look for a job so that i could have medications at night to sleep and to relax in the day i hate this im bipolar for 11 years and no children,1
im on seroquel and it helps me a lot i sleep on it and it helps with anxiety i was offered it like you 5 years ago and was certain i would not take it but then ended up with phychosis severe i was sectioned and it had helped me become well then it was lowered nearly 2 years ago aniexty got so high i had a manic episode so on it at higher doses now and diagnosed with bipolar  if i took it earlier at the lower doses i would have avoided getting so ill and would be on lower doses but i was then anti medication but now it has been a life saver im also on two others now lithium and venaflaxin  good luck ,1
medications work differently for different people ive had to change 3-4 times now and finally wellbutrin works for me in the day and 1/2 a xanax at night i didnt like the way seroquel as it took longer to kick in and id fall asleep late and wake up late feeling like a zombie i even started getting night terrors i work weekly with a therapist and just started group dbt therapy one thing i can tell you that has worked very well for me is volinteering im around other people who care about others and the people you help are appreciative which makes me feel better about myself good luck,1
everybody has somethng buddy noone is normal dont feel bad about having to take a med if it helps you to feel better i highly doubt you will be looked at different its noones business anyway noone has to know i mean it doesnt have to be a deep dark secrect but you dont have to tell everybody eitherjust try it it will probably help,1
has your dr diagnosed you as having a psychosis or is it just your girlfriend who thinks you do? as for feeling embarrassed about taking meds thats totally untrue whether you take meds for a physical or mental health it doesnt matter its yo help you live your life better,1
i am sensing a whole different question coming from you than the question about the med being okay i am sensing a question about am i going to be looked at differently because of this medicine? well that medicine is more used for people with bipolar so have you been diagnosed with bipolar? are you willing to talk to tell people you have bipolar? if not then dont worry about it if you dont want people to look at you differently or to think about or know about your mental illness dont share about it i share because i feel it is part of who i am and i am open about who i am and hiding parts of me makes me feel ashamed of those parts but for others they are like "it aint nobodys business" ,0
whos business is it? whos going to know? you need to do what makes you better or takes the edge off dont be scared it will all be finejust give it a try thats the best you can do to help you good luck x,1
hi! heres a little background that will help you understand where im coming from my family has always shut the door to mental illness at 19 i got pregnant and then "forced" into a marriage with the father (doctor refused to put fathers name on birth certificate bc we werent married) i was then abused and had 2 more children by unconsentual sex i finally left at age 22 with my 3 babies my ex husband tried to kill me and unfortunately lost my children (they live with my folks) ive always known that i was different mentally ive had some other pretty messed up stuff happen to me im now 27 years old taking a handful of meds daily in 2012 i finally went to get a mental evaluation per orders from dcf i went in cool as a cucumber bc i knew i was normal come out of there with severe ptsd bipolar anxiety depression ocd insomnia so forth & so on and scared to death bc i wasnt normal ive come to terms that im not normal but ive also become unsure of what normal is!!! i moved into a home across the alley from my folks and live a somewhat "normal" life i still have the daily struggle with the fact that im not "normal" but ive also started to wonder wth normal is ive fought with my own mother for some time about her self inflicted ignorance about mental disorders (she feels its all in our heads) my mom refuses to believe that bipolar is a chemical imbalance in my brain she refuses to believe that someone that isnt in the military can have ptsd she tells me that i worry too much thats what anxiety is the way i look at it is being cookie cutter normal is boring at least im exciting lol!!! embrace who you are sweetie! we are who we are for a reason loving yourself especially because youre extraordinary is such a wonderful feeling as for the seroquel i personally have a love hate relationship with it i am on such a high dose that i cannot function unless i take it after i am in bed for the night i dont like the fact that i am jello after i take it but i notice a very big difference if i dont take it my friend jokes and tells me its the pill that masks lol it helps me look "normal" i am on such a high dosage that it helps me through out the day function as a responsible adult i totally understand that there is such a high stigma with mental illness but whatever it is is no different from any other disease its not like after diagnosis and medication it will be tattooed on our foreheads i worried for 2 years that people could tell i was a medicated psycho but when i explained to my boyfriend he said "it seemed like you had your ducks in a row better than most people without mental disorders" ive showed my self harming scars and he didnt even notice the thick ugly scars until i pointed them out i truly hope that things get better for you and that you get the help you need whatever it may be my advice is hold your head high even when you feel that you cant educate before you medicateand love yourself even when you feel unworthy!,0
i was assessed and judged to be not at risk so i didnt even go to hospital i do have support from a care worker and some meds have calmed me down im just making music editing video and photos the things i enjoy in life! that is keeping me stable! ,0
exactly im on a disability support pension and cant afford private health insurance because of that im always at the bottom of them pile just getting the disability pension was the hardest and most stressful fight in my life and ive had a rare life already!,0
all emergency services here in australia are very slow unless life threatening mental health is never a priority again unless life threatening best wishes dale,0
good advice by all and nothing to be ashamed of but i can see why you might want to remain anonymous most people were very supportive when i was diagnosed,0
only a psychiatrist a dr who specializes in mental illness can diagnose you why do your friends think this? does anyone else? bipolar is nit just about having up and down moods there are two types of bp 1 which to be diagnosed you need to have at least one full episode of mania behaviour bp2 involves a more rapid cycling of depression and hypomania mania involves behaving recklessly putting yourself in danger losing inhibitions thinking you are invincible have special powers over spending extreme obssessions paranoia hallucinations but not all but main difference between mania and hypomania is that with mania the person loses their insight into what they are doing and believe it completely normal when its clear to others with hypomania the person is aware of their behaviour but unable to prevent the cycling its not usually as visibly destructive as mania can involve being really energetic ie starting something and then suddenly stopping anxious not sleeping obssessing compulsive behaviour  but if you are concerned you need to see a dr for a proper diagnosis,0
dont take the words of a friend as a diagnosis you must see a doctor for that nothing bad will happen you may not have bipolar but another mental illness or none at all please dont sit and worry about this see your doctor,1
thats the only way youll know for sure and be able to get the help you possibly need im bipolar once i was diagnosed i made more sense to myself go theres nothing to be afraid of,0
im afraid nervous and aghhhgg !! i have many what ifs,0
recently i was started on effexor i also am on topamax welbutrin (weird i know) and buspar i also take prasozine or mini pan at night so for me this works but you cant just go off any med cold turkey without having side effects that could be life threatening! you are also the person who is ultimately going to be affected by the med so you should be the one who should have the most say in what goes in your body!! be proactive! get educated on all the drugs the can treat our condition! the information is out there on google print out the sheets on each drug know what has and hasnt worked for you keep really good records for those times when you wont be able to think straight or when a loved one will need to get your history if you get hospitalized i have been in this boat since i was very young and back then there was no one for me even now it is extremely difficult to slogg through the mental health system i have been through hell and back again i am seriously considering starting a blog to talk about what i have been through in hopes to start a conversation about what to do and what not to do my boyfriend and i also want to start a suicide support group there simply is anything out there for those of us who came back and now must find ways to cope with what happened and keep the light burning,0
what dose of zoloft are you taking? i felt exactly like you (zombified) when i was taking only 50 mg despite my hesitancy my psychiatrist increased my dose he explained that low doses affect the sleep stimulator in the brain as a result a higher dose is necessary,1
i have ptsd bipolar schitsoeffective add i just took myself off off lithium pristique adderall sereqil just because i desperately want to change my dr i found one in the same bldg i like that one he was recommended by my therapist they both had a meeting the other day the one i want to go to said it would be best if i stayed with current dr? i asked why he said to long to answer shouldnt i have the right to change i am petrified of the current dr,0
for anxiety is lorazepam ok better take first the anxiety away and take a moodstabilisator olanzapine can help low doses,1
im almost 44 and the same thing happened to me just 3 weeks ago i was diagnosed bipolar 2 almost 3 years ago no matter what medication my doctor put me on it didnt work or i had horrible side effects i went into a 3 week day hospital program new psychiatrist looking into my history instantly thinks adhd start treating me for that by day 2 i felt better than i have in almost 10 years that being said the depression/irritability is starting to come back i fully expect at my next appt with my regular psychiatrist shell be adding an anti depressant adhd was never something i thought i had despite 8 other family members having it including my son,0
each medicine can cause severe adverse effects for some paxil made me almost suicidal prozac and zoloft triggered mania rapid cycling after they would have to raise my dosages far higherhuge withdrawal fairly quickly from ssri i get brain zaps and auditory hallucinations shadows when i dont keep in my system and found out the hard way also that ones like wellbutrin are not ssri but dopamine so i had 1000% ssri withdraw and zero help for mental health after 15 years of meds ive found that lamictal is a necessity and adjusting anti depressant sometimes to very low dose when hypo mania just monitor the depths of your lows or side effects and if thats happening then absolutely dont stop with only 1 medicine i hope that you know you are beautiful courageous and strong and reaching out and talking with others that have same diagnosis also helps us release a huge trigger many of is have guilt or shame that we make others lives worse  or that anyone couldnt possibly have moods thoughts traits that we dobeing heard by others that truly understand is such a way to just release a clogged brain #dontstoptalking dont stay silent even just write thinga down and throw away and never read it again if you cant talk about anything take care of yourself #bornthisway,0
anxiety meds can help you through this also i carry one of those lavender scented candles in my work bag the little ones you can get at yankee candle taking a few breaths of that candle actually calms me a bit hang in there,1
first off good for you for recognizing that this med was a horrible fit for you! however it is always best to call your psychiatrist/prescriber when you see such drastic and crippling changes and they should listen and take you seriously and help you get off of it if they dont time for a new doc but if youre ever experiencing such crippling side effects especially thoughts of any sort of harm to yourself or others you have to call and they have to listen and advise accordingly immediately not expect you to wait and suffer until your next appointment,1
do you have any medication to take for anxiety? maybe that might help in this circumstance,1
music does show to help! singing as well! i did so much better when i sung in a choir one thing i have discovered is that silence is a horrible thing for me and music touches my soul,0
zoloft is not good i had more restless and more huge crazy anxiety,1
hallucinations are a tough on i hear voices all the time which i know arent real and that i should ignore im on olanzapine to help with that as for anger have you tried mindfulness? its used for anxiety but it helps me to focus and breathe and for anger or anxiety to pass it might be with checking out the web and there are apps for your phone be careful hallucinations and anger can be a sign of mania keep in regular contact with your therapist and see if you can get into your dr sooner keep a journal of your moods feelings etc it will help when you take it to your appointments take care,1
i have a wonderful healthy son i was diagnosed 5 years before we chose to vet pregnant i was very stable then i have a supportive husband that helps a lot during those times of major depression but because i have my boy it makes it easier to keep pushing through also during pregnancy i consulted very seriously with all my doctors about my meds we all decided that it was safer for me to stay on them than risk an episode during pregnancy my son was born with slight symptoms of withdrawal but other wise completely healthy has been 100% fine since birth i fell like we made the right choice for our family,1
i have bipolar and a 10 year old son i had him before i was diagnosed we decided to not have any more children because of my diagnosis we were afraid taking meds while pregnant would harm the baby and getting off the meds to have another baby would harm me i did have horrible postpartum depression with my son which led to my diagnosis it has been a real challenge being there for him he doesnt understand why mommy gets tired or sick all the time i am also worried about the genetics component he has already been diagnosed with adhd and we fear he will be bipolar as well its a tough decision consider carefully,1
i think there is an element of guilt ya carry cause there is a chance and no its not certain or what the future holds for you and them i had my kids before my diagnosis and after everything ive gone through they are my world but i feel awful for what theyve been through and have 2 go through because of me plays heavy on my heart but there is no right answers just what you think is right for you,0
if you feel strongly about it then i feel u should just concentrate on yourself u dont need added pressure and also not just yourself to think about your being sensible and the right thing do what makes u happy in life dont add the stress x,0
i have bpd depression anxiety and an eating disorder and i am not willing to get married nor have children im still 20 but if i cant be stable all alone how can i ever have a stable relationship with a partner or children? i will personally pass however everyone is different and you gotta choose what feels best for you ❤,0
i am just so unsure and insecure about having kids i am sure i wouldnt have any problems taking care of them and im sure that they would mean the world to me but i dont want them to grow up facing this illness i hate it i wish i wasnt sick ,0
this is a great question and one that shows a lot of fore sight on your behalf and by extention a duty of care to any potential child i struggled with that decision all the way through my child bearing years but could never grasp the concept of taking care of somebody else when i can barely take care of myself its not something you can back out of once its done if you dont like it i never did have children but it wasnt because i was afraid to pass anything on but because i could not have given a child the care they need maybe something to think about?,0
i wasnt diagnosed until after id had my children they are both fine and well adjusted children (18 and 13) they know about my illness and i have always been honest with them about it i think the one good thing about having the illness is that of either of them had of inherited it from me then they would have been diagnosed a lot sooner than i was as we know the symptoms and also as we have experience of it then they could be helped and understood more nobody else in my family has this illness but i dont think that knowing i had it would have put me off from having them obviously i would have been concerned about passing it on to them as i wouldnt wish it on anyone but if you decide that you want children then this horrible illness shouldnt stop you as there is no guarantee that they will get it whatever you decide in the long term i wish you all the best ☺️,0
its hard having kids with bpd i also have a tbi ocd and gad but my manic and depressive stages are even harder with kids it can be done but sometimes its overwhelming and you cant take most your meds while pregnant so be careful there too,1
i have 2 children i was diagnosed at age 10 did not take meds while i was pregnant but life up until them was on and off my meds never was really under control my son bad been diagnosed with adhd i watch him closely afraid it was misdiagnosed and he actually is also bipolar my daughter is wonderful no mental illness so far i know that without my children i would not be where i today found decent been on meds three years straight now we are very open about our mental illness and our feelings they have watched me struggle at times but have been there and understand whats going on when i cycle i have made sure they are educated about it i do not regret having them but when i had them i never took into consideration they could also be diagnosed i was young and uneducated,1
i have bipolar 2 and i am pregnant with my 4th child my oldest two have mental health issues (not bipolar however my 7 year old has rapid mood swings) it can be passed down and i am always scared for that i would hate for my kids to ever feel how i have felt but i think my chances of them not getting it are pretty good if they end up with it at least i have experience with it i was diagnosed a year ago and three of my kids are 3 7 and 10 it is hard to parent when my mood are crazy but i try my hardest,0
both my kids have anxiety and depression issues but because they saw me getting treatment from a young age and i got them treatment when they showed signsthey and i are dealing with our illness well and they even help me at times my daughter is having her second child and we already talk about treatment for my grandkids if and when they show signs of anything my pastor is the one that taught me to get ahead of this illness with my kidsif i hadnt it would be a mess it took me over 25-30 years to get my cocktail of meds and therapy rightmy kids only took 18+ months for thiers be pro-active is my only advice children are a gift and just because you have bipolar doesnt mean you dont deserve such a tremendously wonderful gift like kids i couldnt imagine my life without them god bless you,1
i have bp and sadly so does my 16 year old daughter we both struggle but she struggles with it worse than i do theres nothing worse than seeing ur child in so much pain and not be able to "fix" it it sucks but i love her more than anything in this world its just me and herwe are close but we have our moments been struggling with this sinse she was about 7,0
seroquel is killer!! 3 years ago i was put on a high dose of seroquel i gained over 100 pounds in one year i didnt know what was happening i was super confused finally my dr took me off of it stating that i had gained too much weight and that "seroquel tends to do that" i was furious he waited for me to gain over a hundred pounds before telling me unfortunately seroquel is one of the few meds that i feel actually do something for me so since then lithium was added to my med mix and back on a low dose of seroquel needless to say i have been unable to shed the weight and feel like im a pound heavier every time i go to dr the gain in weight is whats triggering the blood sugar problems ive also been on highest dose of gabapentin for a long time now and dont feel that it is a contributing factor to my weight gain,0
so truei still struggle with my behaviour of 12 years agi,0
guilt so powerful,0
im the fourth generation to have bp no children for me im afraid i have borderline personality disorder too so doubly bad it wouldnt have been fair on the kids or my husband he has enough to deal with but we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary im sure the pressure would have blown us apart i borrow other peoples children and spend all my money on us! its great!!! go with your instinctsyoure an intelligent person ,0
i was diagnosed at 14 i am now 27 and have 2 beautiful girls while it is definitely on my mind and i am constantly on the watch for signs of mental illness i am so very grateful for the love of my girls i honestly contemplated suicide a few months ago the only thing that kept me out of that dark place was the thought of them having to see me in a casket and asking why i would never wake up i understand that they have a higher chance of developing the disorder since i have it but i feel like i will be prepared to help them should they inherit it i do fear for them as any mother would and i struggle with the "what ifs" and the guilt if they do develop it but "what if" i worry about all this and nothing ever comes of it? they arent guaranteed to get it ,0
no one in my family has bipolar or should i say no one has ever said they were bipolar  i have a son who is 5 and a daughter on the way  i wasnt diagnosed with bipolar until my son was 3 years old  knowing what i know now and becoming educated on the disease i wasnt scared to have another !!,0
do smack heads hold their heads up high doubt it,0
its just a new hairstyle called "manic panic" ive done it too i almost did it again last week,0
anxiety over fixing my hair pushed me to shave mine im glad i did i actually love it lol,0
shy nielsen,0
i am having some major depression at the time  i want to sleep a lot and eat sweets and carbs i am struggling so much just to live from one day to the next hoping new meds will help,0
those are considered to have many blurred lines multiple therapists and psychiatrist have said i have both with psychotic tendencies on many occasions i quit going cuz i became even more confused,0
loved it cause it helped my anger issues and anxiety from my bipolar but i gained 45 lbs fast and i craved carbs,1
i was on 5mg morning and 20mg at night but now i only need 10 mg at night i was put on the stronger dose to deal with bipolar psychosis and now the voices stopped and im taking it to help to stabilise my mood and anxiety i think its great the only side effect i have was on the stronger dose was drowsiness but i got used to it and on the smaller dose i dont feel groggy at all my psychiatrist says its hard to know which one of my drugs is making it hard to lose weight because they all can cause weight gain all in all its a drug that has caused the least amount of side effects remember though everyone is different,1
ive been diagnosed bipolar 1 ptsd from domestic violence childhood also year ago march 8 three days after my 39th birthday my mother almost killed me with her honda crv in the garage shes diabetic she cant feel her feet very well so that cause ptsd flashes and so on i also know i have the neurosis which is the medical term for being neurotic i have shaking leg syndrome ocd for my hands being clean and i cross cut but i use hot water which i started doing in 2013 i found out at the age 39 last august that im bipolar im on escitalopram/lexapro antidepressant 20mg a day and for the mood stabilizer im on divalproex extended release 2000mg a day im having some dangerous driving problems eversense the garage accident i am driving a hundred miles an hour past an illinois state trooper what else every time someone purposely gets into slow me down ill just go i dont care or they ride my ass at 75 80 miles an hour that will trigger me and ill just take off going to commit suicide last year they gave me a hotline to call i did now i have insurance and i have help hopefully things will be better in a year sometimes i feel like im having a mini-stroke im just sitting there looking at picking up my controller play a video game but that i just stare at it and do nothing i was like my brain is just getting fried or freezes up or something everything thats going on right now with the law emotions my body i think its just easier its better just to say goodbye go take care of some things and then and then to go even though i know thats the depression talking it would solve the issue because well theres no cure for what i have thats a bunch of my impeccable long-term memory my short-term memory is terrible but i can remember my whole life just about and im not talking about special moments talking about most every day every week every month and every year of my life sometimes i think that im in hell and thats why all this shit this happening to me or that maybe were in a computer see the world in this is a prison and we are all pieces of shit sent here to suffer because we were bad either way life sucks life sucks!!!!,0
its easier to suffer in silence for me i get told off for speaking out bout how i feel or im told im wrong or im being sillyliterally smash my head off a wall sometimes n i get so mad i black out n swear n cry n break thingsi calm down relatively quick but it leaves me light head and rapid breathingswear i panic attacktold its anxiety i dunno i give up,0
just sick of butterflies and worrying all the time x,0
or you have my psychologist - "youre fine its just doubting yourself",0
definetly have 8 of these i used to be #1 when i was younger and i dont start any fights but people be bullying me and sometimes i have to defend myself verbally or physically but ive been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 since im more depressive and have major anxiety it really sucks and its hard for people to truly understand but i go day by day for my soon to be daughter and husband which im glad he is there for me physically and emotionally even though it can be difficult,0
10 out of 10 and morethe struggle is real,0
are you on any medication currently? i have found that certain tablets can cause very vivid upsetting dreams,1
i too suffer from vivid dreams i wake up sometimes with anxiety due to the dreams i dont have any remedy just knowing im not alone in this made me feel better good luck to you,0
xanor helps me with my dreams its for anxiety but makes me sleep and dreamlesa,1
im currently on zoloft and its also my first medication so far ive noticed it helping my anxiety but having some breakthrough depression (can cry sometimes for no reason) ive had minimal side effects with it so im going to stick with it in hopes it works for me,1
most dont even have a clue unless someone they love are affected and get to see the day to day struggle just to get out of bed and face the day first hand!!!!,0
i might have to disagree with this one depression is terrible and no one will argue that and until i got my diagnoses medication and subsequently my worst hypomanic episode yet i never would have said this depression taught me exactly what i am afraid of and the mania has me face those "fears" without a second thought i spent so many years hating the world and everything about myself that now i can turn even the worst of things into a joke and rarely let it bother me i even attribute a decent about of my life success to depression all i ever thought was "things have to get better this cant be how life always is" so i just kept moving forward i tell everyone im crazy i have no shame,0
dont worry about it kiddo love you too,0
didnt know this was visible to all my facebook friends really testing this "no shame" thing lol thanks dad love you,0
if anything she can have mine and all my problems all she mainly has is anxiety and depression i have bipolar i major depression and insomnia it pisses me off she would wonder around telling people she has it just so they pity her,1
suffering from bipolar most of my life has been one hell of a ride i have scars it does make me laugh when someone is sad because its a monday they go to the dr and poof theyre bipolar drs are passing that out like its candy big pharma likey i dont wear my heart on my sleeve but i have lost a lot of friends and family due to my illness its not fun to be manic and out of control to only cycle to a depression that tears at your inner being hopeless and afraid dont shower or shave dont turn on my phone staying inside my homethen im good again the rollercoaster never ending heightened anxiety with fits of rage here i am in my cage people scoff at me thinking im fineits all in my head well yea! it is in my head! intermittent explosive im sorryalways im sorry its my fault when its not i recede into my darkness and wallow in my mire,0
lamictal wellbutrin and hydroxyzine [anxiety as needed] ive been on many different combinations and this so far with some adjustments in higher dosage has worked so far im so grateful for these meds and my own management using cbt ive finally found the right combination and counseling after 10 years that were very tough through mania and depression,1
latuda for bipolar celexa effexor and silenor for depression and anxiety,1
í take vengador two in the morning clonzepam for anxiety three times a day as needed and buspiron twice a day but been told they want to take clonazepam off for good to all persons,0
lexapro lorazepam and my doctor told me that i need to cut down on smoking bud get the fuck outta here with that shit what does he know? it helps with my anxiety unlike others where it raises the levels of anxiety,1
my mental health doctors have told me to carry on smoking! but my gp doctor has told me to cut down it helps with my anxiety and anger too so sod what anyone says! x,1
i self medicate sometimes too and all i get is its illegal no compassion! f them! i would most likely be an alcoholic if i could stand the taste of liquor i prefer weed and its my life and my pain that i have to escape from and nobody in my family gives a damn! i moved 400 miles away from all of my family because that was a big problem always being told"you have a great life so why are you so sad?" i tried for years to explain things to them but they seem like they could care less about my depression and anxiety! i moved on december 26 and only 4 of my family members have been in touch i am very fortunate to have friends that care and support me,0
yep if whats making you miserable is treatable with medicine,0
do you take propranonal for anxiety?,1
im not sure which is more terrifying id like to know which is closer to the real me though,0
people use to my mania im fun they get scared of my depression n worry,1
im more scared of the mania and what it turns me into i live in fear of having another mania episode because i dont think i or my family can live through it all again :(,0
me too i have a problem with irritability when im manic not fun at all,0
been treated for depression anxiety and bipolar for awhile now meds and therapy have worked until recently seems like meds are working as well i switched to a new med and its been better both bipolar and bpd characteristics fit how i am,1
its common to have multiple diagnosis until you get one that actually fits essentially if the treatment is working go with it i was diagnosed with depression borderline then finally bipolar and anxiety once i got my final diagnosis my meds and therapy helped things fall into place,1
i am bipolar this is semantics and everyone is too fucking sensitive about the words we choose i dont "have" bipolar its not the flu its not acne its not something i can get rid of its not something that magically developed over the course of my life i was born bipolar and i will be bipolar until the day i die i dont "have" anything except a bad case of irritation with sensitive little babies who are bothered by me using the wrong words,1
interesting viewpoint i always say that i am autistic because i dont believe that autism is a disease therefore i dont have it my entire existence is defined through my perceptions which are undoubtedly and thoroughly autistic i can totally see this viewpoint though bpd probably feels more like a disease going by what people have said i wouldnt want to be defined by something that sounds so uncomfortable,0
o god yes i started gaining on zoloft kept gaining on lexapro and didnt stop until i started wellbutrin ive gained almost 45 pounds altogether its horrible,0
effexor can give u adrenaline rushes i was put on neulactal to stop them just get regular blood pressure check ups,1
i didnt realise this was to high a dose my psychiatrist didnt say anything to me his even said i can take more if it continues not to work properly i have manic depression anxiety bipolar panick attacks any small incident can have me feeling really sad at times especially if someone is nasty to me as i was mentally abused my whole life,1
ive read a few people who have said they take more than 200 mg and either theyre mistaken or their dr is misprescribing bit worrying,0
tracie camm southan cannabis can exacerbate symptoms you must know what strain youre smoking but dont smoke it vaper or eat it much healthier i had brain shocks coming off effexor horrible stuff,0
i used to be on effexor & smoked a bit of cannabis to help anxiety but had a heart attack & quit since they changed me to zoloft iv gone from 55 kilos to 76 i dont know if its because i quit cannabis or because they put me on zoloft  i couldnt stay on effexor because it makes ur heart beat very fast which i get tacky cardia already so could not take them anymore,1
most depression anxiety and bipolar medicine will increase your weight!,1
i have been on it for 12 years and love it!! im still on the starter dose of 375 which works for me and being hypersensitive to medication i understand your apprehension give this one a try!!,0
you can get your meds pre packaged for morning noon evening and bed time it costs me $900 a month to have that and it makes things so less stressful,1
i dont recommend serequil way too may side effects effexor (venlafaxine) worked great also really helped with my severe anxiety i had no adverse reaction take it it helped me,1
meds will affect people in different ways it is a great idea to keep a journal when you start a new med to chart what is happening that way you can let your doctor know of any severe side effects and as i have stated before google effexor and get all the info you can as well as all the info on all your meds keeping track of what has and hasnt worked is very important as well as why you stopped a medication i started effexor in november and no one told me about the night sweats i also got a cool med dispenser from amazon that allows me to set up my meds for the week but has individual containers labeled for each day the container has little compartments for morning noon evening and bedtime meds i adjusted it for when i need to take my meds and set an alarm on my phone and it has worked out perfect almost no missed meds,1
have you thought of other alternative medicine like cannabis i have depression and anxiety and it helps keep me calm,1
best way i have found to remember to take my meds is to get get a box with the am/pm if needed and to put a alarm on your phone something most people keep on them at all times now days that way when you get the alarm you remember to either take your meds if you havent or check to see if you have and since you have the convienant box you know if you have or not,1
ive always had the worst side effects with any of the anti depressants ive been on the worst being suicidality and ive tried them all my doctor has told me if i wanted to try any more i would need to do it as an inpatient in the psychiatric ward something im not keen on as for remembering to take medication if you set an alarm and have it at the same time every day eventually your body will trigger its own alarm good luck and sending you lots of healing energy ,0
all medications have some kind of side effects but everyones experience is different the medicines information leaflet will list all potential side effects according to severity and how common they are remember any antidepressant will take a good few weeks to produce benefit as you gradually increase dosage i was on venlafaxine xl ( check if that what you have been prescribed as xl means it gradually releases rather than all at once) for many years with no issues but i was prescribed trazadone and had serious reaction to it and ended up having breakdown and in hospital similar to what you described but i that is very rare the withdrawal symptoms of venlafaxine are brutal - even after missing one days dose you will start to feel dreadful so if you are not good at remembering then venlafaxine is not ideal as its best to try and take them at the same time each day you could put reminders on you mobile choose times when you always do something and include taking your tablets,0
i am also on medication to be taken twice a day the best method i have found to help me remember is to take them at the same times everyday i take mine at noon and midnight i took effexor 150 mg it didnt help me it caused me to experience extreme anxiety and irritability these side effects were so severe that i almost lost my job hope this advice helps!,1
initially made me very tired but that wore off after a few weeks i started out on 75mg then was increased to 150mg and then 225mg psychiatrist wanted to up them further as he stated they work differently at a higher dose but i wasnt so keen on that idea they did help my mood a little but not enough for me to keep taking them i had very few side effects from them each person is different though so theyre always worth trying i struggle to remember to take my meds as well so i sort them out into a weekly pill organiser and keep them next to to the bed i drink a lot during the night so my pills are by were i keep my drink and​ that way i tend to remember them good luck x,1
cud she pm me just saying i found effexor no good for anxiety bt wif quetiapine i find it works well at both,1
i always set an alarm on my phone plus my fiance reminds me,0
i agree if you have a cell phone with an alarm app use that i have trouble remembering my evening and night meds so i have alarms set makes it a lot easier also i had venlafaxine and it worked well for me it was one of the better ones for me but remember everyone is different,1
if you have a cell phone set the alarm on it to remind you to take your pills you can set several different alarms for each time necessary,1
sharing from a member can you please post this anonymously for me best thing i ever did was get off venlafaxine (under the guidance of a doctor!) i was a lot like you agoraphobic and had to have someone with me at all times i had the paranoia about people looking at me and judging me depression anxiety panic attacks and ptsd since changing meds in september im back at tafe two days a week and thinking about going on a holiday ive improved so much im like a new person i got a new shrink and a new gp im now on 100 mg of seroquel (quetiapine) at night to help me sleep and take the chase out of me (in low doses its apparently great for anxiety) and im on 200mg of zoloft i was on double that to begin with (both) but have since september halved it i take a valium at night to because i have restless legs ive been on meds in the past that made me have suicidal thoughts if it happens again tell someone asap there is light at the end of the tunnel stay strong xx (28 years old and have suffered mental health issues since i was 13) if the op would like to get in touch im willing to share my email,0
i have bpd and have been on venlfaxine /effexor for about 10yrs initially they helped with my depression but im not so sure now ive been wanting to come off them for a while but my dr advises the decrease will take at least 12mths to avoid withdrawal symptoms unfortunately what works for one person doesnt necessarily work for another so even if i were to say venlfaxine was great for my anxiety they may not have the effect on you blessings ,1
for whatever reason i had to take the name brand of it effexor bc i couldnt tolerate the generic it helped with my fibromyalgia but not so much the anxiety or depression,1
it did help with the anxiety,1
the problem is that the two are linked there are a number of mental illnesses which can lead to people drinking and becoming dependent some mental illnesses include self-sabotage impulsivity and risky behaviour as symptoms saying people have a choice is true but you have to realise that not all people are weighing up the pros and cons the way a healthy person does because they cant make their brain function that way not because they wont they are less capable of making the correct choice because of their mental illnesses if you havent resorted to self-medicating great i dont self medicate i have self harmed as a coping method though which is also a choice but also a symptom of my mental illness we need to see addiction as an illness because people cant get out of it on their own because addiction can lead to expensive illnesses (cancer liver damage psychosis depending what a person is addicted to) and because illness can lead to addiction (both self medicating with drink and drugs and becoming addicted to prescription meds) it fits between illnesses and therefore has to be considered an illness there needs to be support for addicts and education to prevent addiction and support for the families of addicts stigma stops people seeking help its no good asking people to stop stigmatising one illness if youre going to actively stigmatise another yes addicts need to take some responsibility yes they cause their families an indescribable amount of pain but we cant breed stigma we need to end stigma so that people seek help help which might benefit them and provide a better future for their families,0
thats the problem with addicts  everything is about them  they take and they take and they take  then they write these bullshit letters as part of their 12 steps to apologize for what theyve done - let me tell you something  thats for their benefit  not ours ! we get plunged into this guilt trip bullshit like we are just supposed to forgive them cause " their sorry " - you wanna make amends ? how about replacing all the property you destroyed ! pay me back the money you owe me  so if your going to send me some bullshit letter that makes you feel better put a check in and maybe i will believe you,1
i havent got a everything will work out story i dont have a relationship thats worked and i did have kids before i got a diagnosis so getting through everything has been tough but ill tell you how i feel because i suffer maintaining relationships and i find the stress of them very hard 2 cope with first make sure you ur as happy within urself as you can be gotta have inner peace and you cant start nothing on messy foundation do things you enjoy socialise with people so you can meet new people even join a dating site if you feel confident to do so treat it more though as getting to know new people and see how things develop always take things slow get 2 know people stops things getting 2 intense and attachment that can lead you 2 get upset if people cant be the right person for you i only spoke up cause though i dont know if i can ever have a stable relationship i do believe within my heart that the right person is out there for everyone its just finding it everyone broken in some way and we all have our floors its just finding someone who can work with yours,0
i am almost 45 been through several marriages(not gonna say how many) most of which i was not medicated i have a 24 year old diagnosed with bipolar and a 20 year old undiagnosed(but i know the signs) i wasnt diagnosed until after i had my boys i hate that i passed it on to my babies but i also wouldnt take a million dollars for them! i have been pretty stable for several years now but im not going to lie its been a long hard road! i hate my boys had to live through some of my worst times but they love me and understand now that they are older but i still feel guilty for putting them through it! this is just my story everyone is different,0
i say just go out and date and not get serious dont date thinking you must find a person to marry just have fun and meet people you will soon find out who is understanding kind caring etc when you think you have found that person or persons introduce them to bipolar and if they ask questions tell them the truth it is possible to date with bipolar and you can find somebody 27 is only young just dont go out there desperate to find someone go and have fun with it,0
thank you for posting this question i have a bipolar disorder depression and anxiety im 28 and finding it hard to date let alone just being around people in general the guy im currently seeing doesnt understand why at times i need the constant validation that we are in a good place or that at times i become too clingy my poor mind just feels broken,0
i got stung with that one also he was emotionally abusive but it was my fault because of the bipolar and it drove him to be insecure!,1
part of this disease is to worry about things that may never happen overthinking is a tough hurdle to get over keep it in perspective and learn how to talk positive to yourself encourage yourself you can overcome those kind of thoughts be your own best friend,0
yes you need to find a compassionate understanding person (there are those out there) my boyfriend of 8 year still doesnt get all the mood swings but is understanding enough to want to help dont be afraid of having kids too i have two beautiful teen girls and they havent exhibited any signs of bipolar disorder and if they do i will be here to help them with it also dont view yourself as broken i tend to think of myself as just different and with a deficiency (i tend to think of my pills as a vitamin for the brain) but if you feel you are lovable and worth it then you will attract someone,1
been on lexipro didnt think it did anything for me supposed to help me i think with obsessing,0
different for everyone for me with depression and anxiety i noticed it was working after about a month on my depression honestly it may have been a slight *contributor* to my anxiety (but to be fair my anxiety meds werent helping either) not on it now but if my depression got bad i would be willing to try it again and for women (idk if common or not) but my dr would have me increase dosage temporarily before cycling that month,1
i do not suffer from bp but a caretaker for a son that has it also his older brother suffers from severe anxiety and depression we have all 3 been on lexapro i take it just for anxiety and the older brother has said it saved his life i get nauseous very easily but it has not effected to one bit but we have been told ssris should not be given to people with bp,1
its different for everybody but lexipro made me sleep almost all day every day i had a headache and was dizzy but thats not why i slept i physically just couldnt stay awake it was horrible it helped with my depression in the sense that i didnt care about anything because i was asleep i also gained weight and im not sure how because i barely wanted to eat and only slept i told my dr i was done with it and wanted something else so he gave me zoloft yeah that did nothing after about 3 months i stopped taking it now 4 years later im on 200mg welbutrin twice a day and it works wonders for me everybody is different and what works for some wont work for others so just "experiment" with it but if youre having any bad / suicidal thoughts while on the meds please tell your doctor or someone that can get you help ♡,1
lexapro (escitalopram) is an ssri antidepressant that can also help associated anxiety like any medication it will take time to see full benefits as you increase dosage i would say about 2 months before full benefits start to show and gradually your generally depression and anxiety should lessen its not a drug that will immediately reduce anxiety,1
lexapro did nothing for me in the end basically all the ssris do jack shit for me when i finally got to meet a proper doctor i switched straight over to quetiapine it worked wonders for me and really helps taking a low dose when anxious unfortunately for me it wasnt enough to hold me so now take lithium and quetiapine good luck every med works differently for each individual,1
it made me more depressed nauseated and restless legs real bad they switched me to celexa ive been on it 6 years now no problems i hope it works for you,1
took me only 3 days to get relief on it and start getting my life back i feel like i crave sweets a lot some restless legs but not anything that keeps me up at night been on it over a decade everyone is so different the way we respond,0
i take lexapro for depression and buspar for anxiety lexapro makes me tired so i take it at night,1
no side effects for me it helps my depression not my anxiety though,1
im on lexipro took about 8 weeks before i felt any difference my doctor said the minimum people should be on it is 6 months i plan to come off soon coz i have a horrible side effect of night sweats :( saturated having to change nearly every night ,0
having bp ii i can honestly say that every med is different and not always easy to adjust too i hated lexepro i had horrible brain fuzz for the first week whenever you are trying a new med patience is key the side effects wear off after a few days if they dont maybe its not the right med for you there isnt one combo of meds that treats bp every treatment is as unique as the individuals brain being treated what i can tolerate may not be tolerable for you but if after a week things are not feeling a little more manageable and after two weeks youre not adjusting then call your doctor!!!!!! seriously sadly this illness is not a one size fits all it truly is trial and error until you find the right dosage that works for you mine was no anti depressant and a smaller dose of seroquel and a big dose of therapy and dont he work patience,1
you are right and its fucked upi am in a 12 year year relationship and sex is important for a healthy relationship and its a struggle to keep that part i feel like i could live the rest of my life without it and im only 29,0
didnt notice it helped at all dr switched me to celexa cant really say i feel that helping either but im bipolar/ptsd/gad/panic attacks as well so that might be why im on other meds as well sometimes wonder if any of them really work i have good days and bad days seems like its just gonna feel this way from now on not sure how i feel about that but thats my two cents and then some best of luck to you a good friend of mine swears by her lexapro and she has depression and mild anxiety,0
depression and anxiety it usually helps my son is bipolar has depression and anxiety and hes never been anything but okay or not good on his meds i just wish they could get the right combination,1
side effects for me was restless legs at night,0
getting off of it is horrible,0
sad but true also avoid any type of confrontation,1
aj kline and severe anxiety,1
i dont im a pretty responsible independent person without alarms,0
i was on 800mg and i felt a lot better but i did gain weight! that got me down so i came off them wasnt good so put bk on them but now on 400mg still struggle with the weight but i can now function as a human being,0
ive been on 100mg at night for 5 years now it helps with racing thoughts and i sleep very well when i feel mania coming on i take 25mg in the day and it helps i have gained weight but not excessive it does make you hungry i take the generic called dopaquel which is a little cheaper i was also afraid to take it at first my phyciatrist prescribed it for me hope it works for you,1
did you have any trouble coming off it?? im desperate to get rid of it,0
i had sugar cravings for about 5 days on that dose and now my appetite is back down i wouldnt worry about weight gain if it helps to balance you out if tried literally everything and saved what i thought was the worst seroquel for last,0
they are both equally as important; significant weight gain is bad for the heart in the long run! i have severe ra ( rheumatoid arthiritis as well as bipolar disorderra markedly increaes your risk of cardio vascular disease through various variables probably the inflammatory nature of the disease is the biggest risk! bipolar in some studies has also shown a correlation with heart diseaseeither through the illness itself the meds or bothi reckon both but it may be heavily linked to the drugs that cause rapid & marked weight gainand associated type 2 diabetes along with metabolic syndrome this is not an option for me given the fact i find it hard to push to do basic exercises never mind the intense exercise that would be needed to combat and mitigate these effects! therefore if this drug does indeed work for me once i am stabilised i will neverheless be requesting a slow taper off of it and then switch to another med if neededone that has much less risk of unatural weight gain and metaboluc disturbances given the very real risk potential of my physical illness! this is just my personal view on this drug; it is certainly not meant to scare or be a deciding factor for anyone else! people should be able to research it for themselves and if they are then ok to go ahead with it they are then in the best place to make an individual decision based on their own experience of side effect/efficiency balance yet another reason that this drug may not be suitable for me in the long term is that it can raise the hormone prolactin which given the fact i have had bouts of pcos in the past is not a good thing! kind wishes to all; sometimes its such a difficult and complicated road we have to travel living with this illness♡¤♡,1
i avoid people and conversation because of that,0
please try lithium oratate in small doses exercise  mediate avoid conflict rest good diet and get into the word of god,1
this isnt about being exhausted its that feeling when youre so depressed you just do not want to life at all you know you accept 100% ";" you will go on but damn this sucks so fucking bad even when im not dealing with this shit im thinking about it my life will be hell for months god please can i just sleep through it its that desperation that this is talking about i was there once and ill work a great deal to keep from being there again ;,0
sleep is a natural response todepression and anxiety - do not feel guilty - just do it,1
usually i get a response and stuff is posted its not usually like that to be avoided but i noticed a change over the weekend too i think admin also have disorders so maybe someone had an emergency,1
my posts dont get posted on here when im in desperate need of peoples good vibes and admin dont answer,0
thinking of you all! stay strong and know you are not alone there is no shame in reaching out you are worth it <3,0
i hope so nervous about this week and i have a bad cough,1
we are afraid to loose what little we have control over maybe just guessing,0
bc of my bipolar im sarcastic and crude bc i lack a filter i also lack empathy i dont care how i make others feeli also dont care how i come across my co-workers know about my illness and no one is bothered by me however if they were i wouldnt carei stopped worrying about others view of me many years ago,0
im the same im not too bad at home but at work i find it really difficult and unbearable at times i dont have any friends at work i get on with people fine but not developed into a friendship im sure most of my colleagues think im a miserable moody cow when in fact im desperate to join in but my mind andoid is constantly going up and down doesnt help being off sick several times over past few years sometimes i really wish i didnt work but i k ow this epilepsy mot be good for me as id just stay in the house,0
your comments give me relief to this aspect of anxiety and gives me hope because i feel that although we feel pain from the social isolation we still persevere thank you for sharing and caring this gives me strength that does not necessarily comes from my medication,0
i follow this page because my son has been diagnosed bipolar 1 i am also about to turn 50 i have 3 kids and one stepdaughter i have worked for a big corporate maritime services company for 10 years i still have no idea what i want to do or be i wonder when i will be a grown up i dont think this is just about being bipolar or depressed or anxious just part of life try not to look for a pigeonhole to put yourself into just try to be kind to yourself and do what feels right and gets you through the day ,0
thank you my question exactly im almost 40 and still cant figure out the answer & it seems no one can answer me either people just keep telling me that i have the answer but seriously thats bullshit ( excuse my profanity) from what i have recently discovered being around people who suffer from ( or people who are willing to admit they have) a mental illness truly brings the most joy peace & self worth out of all of us i spent 30 days in an adult facility and felt the most alive and the most myself for the 1st and apparently the only time in my life im once again lost no drug no therapy no amount of money can compare to the unplugged no judgment pure love you get amongst the diverse people who share our same life long struggles with mental illness of all types (different yet the same) ♡ ;,0
i live in a 10 by 12 tiny home you cant put much in it and i am happier than most people who have everything god is my rock and helps me with my bi-polar because he helps me take the focus off me my brain gets confusedmy hearing very bad when you ask god to help then read the bible for his answers to help youand pray for motivation and the desire to do what he purpose for youthen write down thoughts of your prayers each day and act on them you can see progressbutyou have to be willing to allow his helpif a person doesnt believe he exists then this wont work,1
prayers for you ive been saying a prayer called deliverance sometimes it helps me calms my mind if you want to try that pm me no pressure ((hugs)),0
find something or better yet someone who can make you laugh uncontrollably especially at the most inappropriate things i know this seems odd or insane to some but it seems to work for bipolar 1& 2 schizophrenia &bpd the worst that can happen is a mood change even if only for a little while right ;),1
feeling nothing is almost worse than feeling depressed i get scared more at the nothingness,0
people always tell me to volunteer guess what i dont want to bug off i have some things i want to do like write a book about my bipolar past 30 yrs of alcohol & crack addiction and my life being a born again christian but i dont know how to start and some other things but im stuck on my kitchen chair playing on my phone avoiding housework every day as it is,0
for me simply being content is my "happy" its not easy but its worth the struggle,0
wow thats a good one! im sitting here today bored depressed and lonely yet i have a ton of things i need to do but my depression and bipolar anxious mind is making me sick i feel guilty for even thinking of having fun!! or any and everything i want to do will turn into a catastrophe! butim sober and im not portraying any of the ugly symptoms of bipolar like i did 10 years ago with medication and counseling im better for that im happy now to get off my butt and do laundry! lol!,0
those admonitions place so much unnecessary pressure on people if a person does not already have mental illness the anxiety and personal second guessing they create is detrimental so if you do have mental illness those admonitions are just that much more so i take them with a grain of salt making the most of life looks different for every person and i believe contentment which comes in many forms is preferable to the often elusive "happiness" sometimes just getting through the day is a huge success,0
i can relate to this plus the added worry that what if i do the wrong thing~sandi~,0
i am bipolar 1 as well as for mei usually only want to hurt myself even when im angry with others the only exception is if i feel my wife or any of my family for that matter is being threatened if you feel like you want to hurt yourself or anyone else and youre not sure you can stop yourselfplease call law enforcement and cooperate with them if you let them know on the phone that you are bipolar and you think its due to your meds and that you are unarmedthey will treat you with compassion and sympathy i hope this helpsi am speaking my opinion based on my experiences,0
i have bipolar i severe with psychotic features ive gotten so psychotic before that police had to get a switchblade knife out of my hands fortunately it was closed or they might have shot me i was so paranoid and thought they were going to kill me it was terrible i seem to be doing well on my meds these days never miss a dose dont want to end up in jail again,0
no it does not mean yr dangerous how horrible to say that your more than likely be a danger to yourself than others end of,0
my answer might not be popular but yes it absolutely can you certainly cant put everyone in a box thou depending on how the person has learned to manage their disorder  like if someone has a history of not taking their meds or is in denial of their disorder  each person is different but unfortunately the "mania" is the irrational part that follows no logic,1
depends what stage they are in and what their situation is i personally when elated am very irritable and have a short fuse but in time u learn to control it more and more ,0
i dont have bipolar disorder but depression and social anxiety and ocd and i am the same im not trying to knock down any of your points im just being supportive,1
sounds familiar but i am not bi polar just suffer from anxiety and depression,1
hey all i am a bit older and have been dealing with this my whole life- can i offer some insights? #1 we need to accept that we are different/special people we are loners and leaders innovators and dreamers we have been trained by the capitalistic media and our culture that we must live in a house with a mate and work and be productive and not make waves well let me tell you that that will never work for you and you need to give up that fantasy i decided to live alone and not involve myself in committed/romantic relationships about about ten years ago i have never been as healthy and happy as i have been since then not having to worry about the pain you cause a significant other with you mood swings and all the other bs that goes with it is incredibly liberating i instead find joy and purpose through helping others especially young people i have more friends than before i have boundaries for my friendships to keep things less emotional i now accept my craziness because it doesnt harm anyone when i am unhealthy i keep people at a distance when i am healthy i strengthen and create new ties as people grow older become more wise and mellow i believe they can learn to embrace their unique neurochemistry and figure out how to use it for good good luck to you all,0
having ptsdguilt & depression from seeing my wifes dead body (heart attack ) i can associate,1
i have been denying my diagnosis but the more i read maybe its true because this is me an i dont even realize im doing it but its ok many people are very successful and that suffer it so im not going to let this stop me from living i am socially unacceptable which im not to worried because a lot of what they accept i dont want to be part of its all messed up because people who know just sit back and watch thats wrong,0
pushing them loves ones away before they push me away and accusing them of not loving me when guilt hits me real hard ,0
im definitely guilty of pushing people away and sabotaging relationships,0
try loving someone whose was soft quite simple doesnt work my husband of 18 years is rough loud bullhead we get along so well that in beginning he couldnt understand why i have frequent usually moods swings so i had to tell him i was seeing and have mentel illness and appointment since i was a kid so one day he start coming with me to my doctor appointment and start asking questions about my illnesses then me so over the years my boyfriend became my husband then he would let me know my triggers when depression try to come on understanding/point out what or who are the triggers or helping me calm myself when i lose it or bad episodes so me loving someone being bipolar i have love that maniac loud rough like my husband don but deep in his hearts he loves the me for me and im bipolar ocd anxiety and ptss as for being a hoarder of stuff(clothes stuff animals and dishes),0
i totally relate to what you are feeling there is no easy solution at least that im aware of im still fighting through a depression and anxiety that has left me disabled the best advice i can give you is to stay close to those few that understand and really try to build a support network that helps lift you up when you cant walk on your own and try to believe that one day you are going to feel better,0
i have suffered with severe chronic depression for almost 20 years when i was at my lowest i felt exactly like this individual therapy group therapy and the right medication helped me get out of that hole but it took almost 5 years before i could see any semblance of my old self every single day is still a struggle but at least i feel as though it is worth fighting through there are a few things i remind myself of daily - i will never be the happy funny outgoing girl i used to be but thats okay because depression taught me how to empathize forgive and accept; although i am lucky in many ways does not diminish the impact my depression has on my life; most people who make rude comments are just ignorant about mental illness not intentionally mean or hurtful; being content can feel just as good or better than being happy; and the fact that i am still here after struggling with depression for so many years is proof of my strength i wish you the best in your journey,0
i dont know who wrote this but i am not ashamed to admit i suffer from these same illnesses and struggle everyday of my life mental illness is real it is not a joke i have some of the very same thoughts everyday of my life and have for over 25 years just because we see someone smile on the outside does not mean that they arent hurting on the inside dont be ashamed to ask for help whoever you may be ♡,0
just know that you are not alone and you are so very loved by all who suffer the very same battle of the mind no matter the diagnosis & no matter how long; we are all in the same hell all we have is god and each other please dont give up and never stop reaching out for support through community like this there is no wrong way to vent we all need to yell use profanity let our lymbic system of brains feel some victory before our frontal cortex can rationalize logic- we all probably go this from time to time or act like a 2 year old its ok to not be ok and its important to feel safe i truly hope that this can be a safe platform for us to be ourselves if not please im myself or contact: 1-800-273-talk (8255) 24/7 national suicide prevention lifeline suicidepreventionlifelineorg i am not a licensed counselor or doctor i am just a person who suffers from bipolar 1 generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks substance abuse ( remission) chronic pain ptsd & im sick & tired of being sick& f***ing tied of this sh*t and i love you where youre at♡♡♡ so please hang in there ;,0
i have been in this spot my ex made it worse he said same cruel things and that i was insane ive been diagnosed with bi polar and am on meds everyday and now im doing great i have 3 kids under 12 single mum and trying now to get a day job in school hours even with meds you have down days and thats where you dont listen to negative crap and be stronger in yourself if i can do it anyone can bi polar ocd anxiety,0
is god accessible to the depressed? god is so close to his depressed servants that it is as if he resided with the “crushed and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly ones and to revive the heart of the ones being crushed” (isaiah 57:15) how comforting to know that “god is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves”!—psalm 34:18 how can the depressed get comfort from god? at any time of the day god’s worshippers have approach to the “hearer of prayer” who can help us to cope with distressing feelings and circumstances (psalm 65:2) the bible urges us to pour out our hearts to him: “do not be anxious over anything but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to god; and the peace of god that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of christ jesus”—philippians 4:6 7 what if feelings of unworthiness make us think that our prayers are not being heard? depression may cause us to conclude that our attempts to please god are not adequate however our heavenly father is sensitive to our fragile emotions “remembering that we are dust” (psalm 103:14) even if “our hearts may condemn us” we can “persuade our hearts” that “god is greater than our hearts and knows all things” (1 john 3:19 20 footnote) therefore you can use expressions in your prayers that you glean from such bible passages as psalm 9:9 10; 10:12 14 17; and 25:17,0
your not alone❤ i have almost your exact diagnosisborderline anxiety n bipolar 1i struggle to take my meds correctly for fear ill get "toxicity" from the lithiumi work now but its a strugglehang in there hun and if you need to vent just a click awaystay strong❤❤❤,1
i have been diagnosed with the same bipolar 2 and boarder line personality disorder i dont tell people i know about it as i am afraid they will stop being my friend,0
this is amazing im currently awaiting diagnosis but i can relate to so much of this thank you for posting this has helped me more then any of the stuff ive read this will definitely help me explain things better to therapist i feel like i am worthy of saving and getting better and you are to weve all got to stay strong and not let this horrible illness destroy us thank you again,0
your not alone there are so many people struggling i have given up on help as unfortunately i found the people i needed help from were in the wrong profession and i walked out numerous times so so far ive found no one some days are so scary i dont no how i get through to see a new dawn one day at a time i wish i could meet up with others,0
im just now accepting my diagnosis im sad an ashamed i have wasted my life to this,0
id get anxiety from it i know it and probably end up abusing it itd keep me out of bed though thats for sure not a good choice for me im on latuda neurontin valium and ambien none of it is working very well im on the verge of losing it again,0
i would wean off the ambien and valium they increase your risk of alzheimers by 60percent they also affect short term memory,1
i was taking adderal and loved it felt more awake focused just alive however it made me very anxious and i became severely manic after being on it for just a short time i know it wasnt medication alone that made me manic seeing as how i am diagnosed bipolar 1 and manic episodes are just part of illness however i experienced a state of mania i had never experienced while i was off of it,0
not good i went crazy on it self harming 2-3 times a day couldnt function properly my anxiety went through the roof x,0
i taken ritaline its helps but not for my anxiety that somethimes kicks in,1
no you should definitely not be started on alprazolam straight of the bat! xanax either! my goodness these are serious medications unless your doctor is prescribing them in minute amounts id be very cautious even 1mg of either of these drugs could be way too much for you to begin with & ive been on both of these at different stages the best of the two for anxiety was alprazolam for me,1
i think im in 2 different discussions haha sorry but my anxiety is so bad i cant work drive associate with public etc my dr said i have to rely on clonazepam to get by for the rest of my life ive tried everything non-narcotic does not work for me our bodies are different,1
most anxiety medications are pretty tame nadine maybe chat to your gp before making any decision personally i cant live without my medications the quality of life just doesnt exist unless im level,0
i am bit scared the take medication for it,1
you take meds for anxiety?,1
never benzodiazepines! this is like drinking 2 glasses of wine every day without the benefits of wine not good for the brain long-term more then 150 days of benzos increase alzheimers risk by 60 percent,0
i self medicated for years using drugs and alcohol to help slow me down then pick me up only to find out i am bipolor plus a few more diagnosis at the ripe old age of 54 yes it sucks and i feel i wasted so much of my life anyway buspar for anxiety has been my saving grace i am a recovering addict so so many drugs mentioned just cant be prescribed for me 15mg 3x daily and im good just thought i would throw this in the mix for those with possible addiction issues have a great day! ,0
yes you are definitely right clarissa anderson i had to try so many meds to get my mood/anxiety right its a very hard struggle but you can overcome it!,1
everyone reacts differently to medication what works for you might not work for others i was taking clonazepam and reacted badly im now on buspar seroquel xr zoloft and tegretol along with weekly counseling this combo has definitely been helpful i still struggle but its no where near as severe as before its been about 2 years since ive been hospitalized or had a suicide attempt and it definitely helps to have a good psychiatrist that you feel you can work with and understands your issues,1
to be flat out honest with you i used to cope with my anxiety with alcohol i didnt know what was wrong with me i thought the worst i went to the dr and he said "it sounds like anxiety" and i was like ok he prescribed me meds and i felt like a new person dont get me wrong i hate going to the dr and having to pay a lot for my prescription but its worth it!,0
pass is the same as clonazepam sorry had to research we are in different countries but yes i take "paxam" 1mg 3x daily for anxiety keep in mind is it very addictive and withdrawals just dont miss your drs appt,1
no zeprexa wont kick the anxiety have you tried busbar? or hydroxyzine? if your anxiety is as bad as mine like "social anxiety" phobias fears not wanting to leave the house due to you just plain freaking out you really need a benzodiazepine,1
yeah zeprexa is strong definitely but i take my meds at night and it stabilizes me through out the day along with my anxiety disorder i take clonazepam,1
im sorry i know how you feel about having a hard time with a new dr i hate new doctors you never know if they suck or not and then i have an extensive medical history from a tbi and many new draft have the magical fix they want to test on me then the first time i admitted i needed psych help the medicine effected me poorly and the dr refused to listen so i had to go to the er and once admitted i had to beg and plead until i found a nurse who would let me call my husband and let him know what was going on and so my kids could come see me before i was admitted it took forever to find the right everything for psych its hard i have bpd ocd and gad sometimes im hate myself as a mom too i have one with a mental illness that has been a struggle for him and i sometimes wonder if he has the early signs of bpd and i worry about my younger ones and i worry i passed my mental and physical crap on to them (tbi was from a tumor) it freaking sucks when you want to die want help and help isnt there just take it one moment at a time one moment you can do it,0
im in sydney australia and your experiences are all too familiar i presented to er and i waited in their interview room for over 18 days only to be told if im asking for help im not at risk of suicide i told them not to do a home visit because i didnt want to upset my father and well 10 days later they arrived on the doorstep on a day that i dragged myself to work in the hope of trying to drag myself out of my depression they told my father everything breaking confidentiality and told him i was an attention seeker years later i called again because my psychiatrist was overseas for 8 weeks and i was told if i could afford psychiatrist i didnt need the public system and that was it im now lucky to have a bipolar i diagnosis im medicated correctly and im able to hold down a job which means i can afford private health insurance meaning im covered for a psych unit people say our system is great and sure everyone is covered but there arent enough resources to go around and the people running them dont have a clue i really dont know what to say except i have some understanding my suggestion is to find a new dr if you can i understand your social phobia may stop that what about a dr that visits your home? we have those in sydney also ring the acute care again and say that you need to have a case worker and a referral to a psychologist they might be happy to transfer you to case management gets you off their books i really hope you can get some help soon you are doing the best you can and that is all kids need to know,0
there is if you dont even know what dbt is and/or have never been to dbt or were just recently diagnosed there are a lot of factors your comment is not helpful i had no idea what the hell was even wrong until a year ago because i was only diagnosed with anxiety and depression and didnt even know what bpd was until after a 10 day stay in the psych ward and a meeting with my psychiatrist i havent gotten to start dbt yet but ive looked some of the skills up and im trying not every therapist or psych dr tells their patients about dbt though maybe think before you speak?,0
hhahahha terkejut sekejap i bila memuler bukak gambar dia scary tapi really meh? i cant relate ahhaha,0
i cant really comment as its different here in uk - you cant just check yourself into hospital you really need to be ill and having been an inpatient many times often for long periods its not a good environment but if you feel you really struggling and really not coping with daily life if going into hospital is an option you shouldnt be ashamed or as if you letting people down  care for yourself,0
when my psychologist suggested i should go to a clinic for bipolar depression and anxiety i was sceptical at first but things just got worst for me to the point where i would impulsively think of ways to kill myself but i went and it was the best thing i ever did you have to do it for yourself because you cant be a good mother for your kids if you dont children are resilient they bounce back quicker than you thinkbeing sick is not your fault and you need to get to grips with that and youll get the assistance and proper medication you need to live a fuller life i was ashamed about my sickness until i realised its not my fault today i have the courage to tell people about my sickness and it doesnt bother them as much as i thought it would they are more surprised and want to know more about it,0
i have a host of issues and on top of that i become suicidal at times more frequent than i used to be that said no i dont go to the hospital because im afraid of them and last time the police made me go to the hospitali spent the day on a stretcher in the main hall with everyone going by me and staring at the crying lady with deep cuts on her arms and wrists no phone no way of trying to calm myself down and refocusing my mind id rather die first before going back there i felt like a humiliated criminal for having a screwed up head,0
ive been inpatient i will tell you this speak to your doctor first they will want to know where you are mentally there is no shame going inpatient you have to take care of yourself to be able to take care of your family my medication was what caused my issue a change to my medication and i was getting better its still been a long ride to finding a proper mix of medicine if you are not feeling ok and are a danger to yourself or others dont hesitate to call your doctor or go to the er,1
going inpatient can be a really good thing im not ashamed to say i have checked myself in several times if nothing else it gives a break from the day to day building of the "real world" 3 days rest from everything can give you the chance to recharge and refuel,0
go youve probably done for everyone else its time to take care of you i was admitted last year after my own struggles it was the best thing i ever did for myself use the opportunity to learn about yourself and let someone take care of you dont let stigmas stop you from getting help you may desperately need,1
get help they need their momma  i was fearful of help till i realized how bad i needed it then i got help and doing alot better  ,1
if you arent feeling ok and feel like youre in need of help to the point of considering hospitalization i recommend doing it i spent a while researching places to go and during that hesitation i did something that landed myself there anyway id say go theres a chance you wont be as lucky as i was,0
i take sertraline which covers both depression and anxiety cant imagine being without half meds though xx,1
hang in there the trials of attempting to find the right medications is a long and annoying but once your doctor and you have found the right combination its worth it i have been seeking for over a year and only now am i getting close but it was worth the struggle,1
if you are frightened of hurting yourself go to an emergency room!! dont give up get help call 911 if you have to its ok you willl be all right you are loved you are worth it,0
citalopram also called celexa is an antidepressant and can also help with ocd and anxiety any antipressant is hoping to take a good few weeks before you feel any benefit it can be increased to recommended maximan daily dose of 40mg any medication can have side effects which you should find listed on the information leaflet however if you are showing symptoms of psychosis or bipolar disorder for instance these need to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist again if you not in uk system will be different,1
i was diagnosed major depression with psychosis in 2011 - 2016 five years i got seroquel 200mg every night and it ruined my periods the psychiatrist told me that i dont need meds any longer but a year after that ive become anxious and suspicious towards others i believe that other people will hurt me leave me taking advantage of me betray me backtabbing me sometimes i talk gibberish cant even make proper coherent sentence acusing anyone else for creating such a plot to humiliate me throwing & smashing things this april 2017 i was taken to a new psychiatrist because i was unable to live a day without being angry and suspicious she gave me new meds : merlopam® 2 (lorazepam 2mg) abilify® (aripiprazole 5 mg) arkine® (trihexyphenidyl hcl 2mg) which i must drink at night before i sleep because the pills make me lose coordination between my mind and body i cant walk or move in balance until the effect is wearing off to be honest i hate taking meds im so sick of meds: pills capsules syrups i used to drink meds since i was 5 years old for physical illness and now i have to take meds for my mental illness its like i spent the most years to take meds but i have to admit : i need it its hard for me to simply admit that i need professional help better drinking meds than getting electro convulsive therapy (ect) once every 2 days like when i was hospitalized in 2011 but when i did admit that i need help everything seems to work in the right path ive just been taking new three meds i mentioned above for three days its hard to get back to the routine : drinking meds after a year free of meds i thought i could survive without meds but the recent problematic events had made me depressed again so i have to admit it : i need help i need meds i need psychotherapy i hope these will help i hope someday ill recover and i wish you all the best too for now i simply think this way : "if i wanna survive without killing myself i must take these meds because my family and friends love me because they dont wanna lose me i do this for them i do this for me too because i wanna save myself" voila! i succeeded drinking meds yeay! maybe now the meds havent shown any progress just yet but someday they would meds for mental illness need at least 3 months before i really feel the good effect so i will keep drinking these until i feel better and i must believe that these pills will make me better it takes time but its worth it someday and somehow,1
i just started citalopram too it takes time but most of the side effects should subside make sure to avoid alcohol and caffeine,1
im all new to this toobut yeah i feel like this a lot of the timei always question if my family love me care for me etcits a horrible feeling really it isim on diff medication and lately my mood has been good very goodive felt content so at the moment i would say im on the right dosethe tablets you are on made me feel sick alsoand yeah they do sometimes make people worse to start off withi dont take an antidepressantbut have had them in the pastyou just have to keep going and stay strong eventually you will find the right medication etc just try to remember the voice is wrong your family love you and want to be thereits very hard for ya family too as they dont really understand it properly mine right now dont eitherkeep ya head up and keep fighting you will win this xxx,0
also look into seraquil thats a mood disorder medicine and helps treat bipolar and anxiety its taken at night the upside to the is they work together and cymbalta once you get to 60mg it can also act as a pain medicine as well,1
look into cymbalta it works with both depression and anxiety,1
you need to tell your dr your fears they need to know and they can then help you be prepared to trial different meds it took me around 18 mths before i found the right combo,1
i was hospitalized for a month last year - first time that had happened im 41 with bipolar 2 and anxiety i left my 3 kids with their dad it was the best thing i ever did; before i went i was so unwell i nearly ended everything now im doing really well never be afraid to get the help you need screw the stigma the people around you with brains and hearts will still be there when you get out xxxx,0
call - get appointment - talk freely with dr so he can know how to treat you - no need to worryjust do it - you will be so glad went besideseveryone needs help from time to time everyone! (some just refuse to admit it) been bi-polar since 92have learned many coping skills & you will too god bless you!,0
go it sounds like you need to theres no shame in making sure youre well,0
ask for help immediately the dynamics in your household need to change so you feel and have less pressure,1
i know what your saying i live with unreality of life and i live for my husband and kidswhen life gets hard talking to someone can dilute your feelings i think a therapist or someone who will let you just release your feelings your drowning in can help but when your down you dont see any other way but if your living for ppl then theres a reason to stay strong i do it so my kids dont come to a place where i am even tho life can be so bloody hard you need to give yourself time and maybe seek medication just to take the edge off i hope this has helped and that you find your way through what can be a horrible thing to live with take care x,0
there is hope you can change your life but you have to stop believing their world stops because of you although im sure you are important the world will not stop turning because you leave i had a nervous breakdown feeling like this and the reality hit me when while i was hospitalized guess what? my kid survived my husband stepped up and dang if no one starved or died without me we put way more pressure on ourselves boxing ourselves into these roles we create this sense of panic and fear that stems more from our illness than from actual truth learn to say enough is enough and dont be afraid to ask for help their world is better because youre in it but it wont stop if you need your time too,0
it sounds like youre experiencing some anxiety instead of focusing on the positives stop thinking about anything calm your mind by focusing on breathing--5 in hold for 5 5 out do this sitting or lying comfortably for 5-10 minutes,0
im like this im fine until i start getting close to work then my stomach aches and i get nauseous and sweaty im actually unemployed right now for that very reason its gets so bad sometimes that i just shut down and become a recluse im medicated and i still have problems with my anxiety and depression like you i try to focus on the positive and some days that works but the thoughts in my head and the feeling in my stomach takes over everything its debilitating and scary but i just keep pushing on and trying my damnedest to stay positive for my family good luck and lots of prayers,0
the second time i attended therapy having being diagnosed with mdd + psychotic features the therapist said i have so far displayed an emotional and dissociation disorderwhen i asked him later during the weekly sessions he told me to continue taking my meds because they are not addictive and also commended me for my courage and consistency to attend therapy sessionsnonetheless the posts on this page has undoubtedly made me realise that i have bpd looking back at the years  the ups and downs feeling like a child despite all the birthdays passing by pushing loved ones away and after longing for them  irrational fears attachments issues hypervigilant teary identify crisis etcooh and the biggie childhood abuse (incest) i am keeping well in the well of ups and downs through gods grace and strength,1
sadly i have both but on the bright side  i manage them well  mostly through avoidancelol i like living in my little bubble of lonliness its safe here there is pizza too! i have bad days which can be very taxing and a trial of my strength and then i have good days which remind me why i keep going thankfully i have some epic kids who make it all worthwhile and make me smile every time im with them =p i dont think i would cope without their presence in my life,0
shame i cant read it,0
every good thing takes time i know how it feels like to stay at hospital i used to get ect once every 2 days but finally im here still alive still breathing still fighting against the voices still struggling just because youre struggling doesnt mean youre failing lets fight this voices together let it flow but dont give up never lose hope ive been there and i survived so will you,0
im recovering as well and i journal all my worries for the day and then tear them up and throw them away then i meditate for 10 minutes it has really helped me,0
people dont let it get to that black whole of nothingness do something about it dont be ashamed its not your fault,0
you dont say what your gf been diagnosed with but from what you have written sounds like bipolar difficult situation if you think children are at risk or in danger then you need to do what is best for them to ensure they ate safe you can either let her know you love her and are there to support her if that is what you want and that you will be there if and when things go wrong or you can decide to make the break unfortunately only you can make that decision sounds like its time to really think what us best for the future of your children,0
there isnt any specific medication that treats bpd so any meds she will have been would have been for depression anxiety which can result in consequence of having bpd or a mood stabaliser if she also as bipolar disorder you dont say what she was on / stopped cbt especially dbt is very helpful for bpd sufferers however her behaviour may not be a consequence of any of above cheating or having affairs or abusing another person does not equal having a mental health illnesse i would sit dowm and speak honestly together about your relationship it maybe that it is over,1
i genuinely dont know how else to say this if a person is taking the wrong meds/no meds at all their ability to think clearly and make good decisions can disappear if you let her hit rock bottom- how will she know shes wrong if she cant control her brain? shes the mother of your children she deserves more respect shes always going to be in your life and so is her mental illness think of it this way- if one of your kids develops a mental illness which is possible due to genetics how would you feel if they were clearly not well and making bad decisions and (god forbid) their long time significant other took the kids and ran? i highly doubt youd support or respect that right now your kids see whats going on they might not understand it but they see it no amount of good parenting will hide that do it for them because they deserve a healthy mom,0
many youth services organizations have positions that require only a hs diploma or ged you would mentor and plan activities for at risk kids one on one some college or x yrs experience in the field is usually required no degree tho,0
alarm clock got wood?,1
dont be afraid to ask for helpits okay! take a day at a time i hope you get the help you need,1
i tried your way jenny franklin and i tried to commit suicide twice always with a smile on my face saying that thinking positive and surrounding myself with positive thinkers i ate the right foods that would help me have a clear mind and energy to live it all failed twice not everyone can cope without intervention of medicine and therapy from good people if they hadnt talked some sense into me about what i was doing to myself i wouldnt be here im dealing with a loss in my family right now and this is the first time ever that i havent had a complete meltdown i feel strong and i can be strong for my kids they lost their dads sister to cancer and they need me to be momnot a hysterical puddle of panic attacks and mood swings,0
i was so sick and scared a few weeks back and i called a crisis hotline and talked to some one and they got me help with in mins they will send you where they can get you some help,1
oh sweetie i hear you so i have tried this and it seemed to help: bubbles buy some bubbles or make your own(super easy) and blow your worries away or blow them out and pop them "pow!",1
i understand i have ocd depression anxiety pstd bipolar since i was 5 and i am 55 now i have been through hell i dont meds anymore they dont work but i see a psy doctor and i have started natural items and vits and stones and crystals medatation prayer and walks i just started all this new stuff a few months ago cause meds dont work for me and i just turned 55 and i am tried of the old life i was living it wasnt working out so well good luck to you,1
i have just about all these symptoms since i was about 12 now i am understanding that maybe my poor concentration and memory loss is because of ptsd shit sucks and its the one thing i am most insecure about,0
wow this is me to a t but ive been told its just depression and anxiety disorder i knew it was so much more then that,1
i can relate to almost everything listed ive been diagnosed with ptsd aboutt 20 years ago everyday is a new adventure everyday a different struggle,0
understand all to well i have pstd and ocd and just found out a few weeks ago i have bipolar 2 and the meds i was taking for ocd is poison to take for people with bipolar :( i have been sick and begging for help for a few years couldnt understand what was going on thought i was going crazy i scared myself so bad i called crisis hotline and they got me in with in mins and talked to me and helped :) its not gone but i feel better and working oon getting well,1
this pretty much describes me am i in denial about why i have depression/bipolar i really should probably seek help but there to i am afraid,1
this whole list (apart from 2) sums me but doctors say i just have bad depression and anxiety could that be the case?,1
the list is complete and the struggle is real,0
totally understand i feel like i have lost my life; i have lost my career my finances my identity my role in life the very essence of who i was born to be i have lost relationships as i struggle to get out of the house and commune with others my youngest [adult] child has moved out so now i live alone with my little dog & two cats for company i sleep on the lounge as im awake all night in front of the television then sleep all day which suits me better than having to endure the long hours of the day i waver between deep dark in the hole depression & a more moderate but just as debilitating mood i frequently spend time thinking about suicide to the point of planning my own funeral the only thing that really keeps me going is a healthy fear of god - we all have an appointed time to die & ultimately its gods decision when that is living with bpd & other mood disorders is mentally physically & spiritually exhausting i grieve & long for the woman i used to be,0
i am a fellow soldier in this battle unlike a lot of people who comment day in and day out i fight & deal with dark thoughts lack of motivation fatigue stress anxiety and now i have recently discovered the possibility that i may also be dealing with ptsd as well regardless i have no other option but to fight it out i dont have insurance; the few times that i have gone to the doctor regarding this crap all its accomplished is costing me money without resolution the doctor wants me in therapy for a year before we investigate medication alternatives the counselors that i have visited with want to talk about the trite & trivial issues de jour instead of giving ideas or suggestions as to workable solutions i know all too well what hell this fight is yet when i share what i am doing people here argue about the natural solutions depression is an ugly thing but with it are many valuable lessons those of us who are not cherry know we can tell when a person is complaining because whining is the only attention they get or when a person is pouring out the b-s just to get the drugs i wish you the best in solving this problem if that is really what you want,0
sounds like your good at pushing yourself away - from life yes depression is around you but so is your head full of negativity and over thinking and pretty soon youll just be in an ugly spin not even you can control it wont be about whether you pray or who you push away your head will win and youll be paranoid at best is that what you want? while youve got the strength youve got to fight for yourself and your little life - its worth something - and quit playing games with people be honest be the best part of you so get of bed and do stuff!,0
im not the one to upset today,0
i know someone who takes it and struggles not to sleep all day been that way for 6+mo,0
yes it was supposed to be for my anxiety and panic attacks and my latuda for bipolar mood swings im am stable and happy,1
it would be amusing if it wasnt so ignorant no everythings fine now i only get suicidal thoughts every other day now im cured!  depression is horrific because theres no pill to cure it its a lifelong struggle its as if your brain is waging war against itself and your stuck in the middle of the trenches some days are okay others are filled with self-hatred monsoons of tears and the need to quit my life and an urge to cave my own skull in with a hammer snap out of it is something you hear all the time trust mea sane healthy individual wouldnt live this hell for 7 years by choice! one day it would be nice for me to explain this to someone and for them not to look at me in horror like im some kind of leper,0
its not that easy and you add to the stigma by saying stuff like this many folks dont get the proper help and struggle to accept they need meds please dont make it harder on fellow sick folks,0
i know my bipolar both on and off of meds i prefer being on them i am less terrified of life im glad that you can live off of them but i surely cant and believe me ive tried,0
latuda left me feeling lathargic most days but i wasnt irritable at least i hope it works well for you,0
im on 200mg of lamictal its the only thing that seems to give me at least a little relief ive not had good luck with antipsychotics in the past so im reluctant to try latuda i google everything about medications before i take them the trick is to stick to and understand the science side of things and give very little weight to the anecdotal side of things it has also been my experience that the vast majority of general practitioners are not up on the latest research and very few like to listen to the patients knowledge and/or research for example my doc had no clue at all that the only 2 mood stabilizers that are truly effective for bipolar depression are lamictal and lithium the rest of them are more effective for mania/hypomania but at least im lucky enough that she realizes i have 30+ years dealing with bipolar and i know more about it than she does,0
i stopped worrying till symptoms appeared ,1
i had to use google before i could start taking meds although there is the rash worry there werent many other side effects that i would be worried about the ratio of help was potentially better i was really surprised!,1
i tried going off meds as i dont like having to rely on all these tablets it was quite honestly the worst decision i have ever made in my life! all was well initially and then things would upset me then smaller things upset me more and so on and so on in the end i ended up in such a bad place i tried to end it all i spent 3 days in icu now i religiously take my medication even when theyre not right for me i keep regular appointments with my psych team and 2 years on although my meds are still not right im in a much better place than i was without them,1
bipolar is bipolar so yep you can be bipolar without taking meds i would never not take my meds because i know i am bipolar and have no desire to have episodes like i can have without my meds we will always be bipolar theres no cure but meds can help with the horrible episodes helps me recognize i am falling into one,1
i am confused as to what you are asking?,0
julie michelle gray i have done it without meds and it made me miserable i hated life couldnt enjoy anything but mine is not just bipolar i have ptsd depression anxiety bipolar and adhd so yes i am medicated better than be sucidial,1
ooo i should know better we are all entitled to our own experience and that is mine i am not the only one who does this every single day regardless of what my bipolar tells me im capable of the bipolar is not the boss of me im the boss of it i dont allow myself to stay in bed no matter how much i want to i keep my irrational temper to myself because i know intellectually im being irrational i very clearly see what the bipolar is doing to me and i fight it tooth and nail every second of every day and when i get tired and want to give up i put on my big boy pants and move on so go ahead and judge me,0
yes i got off the meds gradually now take chamomile capsules for anxiety a brain supplement for brain health a multi-vitamin and eat a pure diet of proteins greens nuts coconut oil green tea some v8 balancing the chemicals out and exercise your body will fight to learn how to balance the chemicals,1
i actually follow a very similar regimen as you and i find it works for me it helps me deal with my symptoms without being medicated however i stay on a very strict diet and exercise regime and it helps for me to have regular contact with a therapist unfortunately however i have not been able to find a therapist so ive been cycling more due to life stresses but i hope to be back on track soon the ups and downs still happen ive had to do a lot of work in therapy groups and individually to learn coping skills to try to deescalate myself before i rev up to full on mania or severe depression best of luck to all!,1
i was diagnosed in 2015i was on lamictal for a while but stopped due to side effects have not taken any thing since  i have been monitoring myself what causes my triggers and i avoid as much as i can ive had some suicidal thoughts and sleep less night a few other stuff but i have been managing well enough i think i try hard to stay positive,1
i feel like lithium gave me my life i cant even say it gave me my life "back" because for as long as i can remember internally i was out of control and cycled between deep depressions to hypomanic irritable episodes every couple of weeks i didnt want to die but i did not want to live either i am not saying you cant live unmedicated but your reasoning should be balanced against what type of quality of life you have medicated vs unmedicated best of luck,0
im afraid to try bc i dont want to start al over but i have gained 30 pounds i still have mini but workable cycles,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar when i was 25 now i am 44 years old it has been a very long hard struggle i have been seeing a psychiatrist this whole time along with one on one therapist group therapy which i really enjoy so 8 months ago i was hired as a peer support specialist at kingsview were i have been recieving treatment for almost 20 years i always thought of my diagnosis and all the hospitalizations and loosing contact with all my friends and alot of my family that me being bipolar with anxiety was a curse that god was punishing me i no longer feel that way because everything that i struggled through made me stronger brave courageous and i can relate to others who have also struggled my life journey isn"t a curse it is a gift,0
im on the same medication as you i hope you get yours adjusted to your benefit i know its hard with stressful people in your life love yourself first then reach out to family god bless you and give you strength to take care of yourselfand family,0
your right i should be feeling better but one of my children died in 2013 at the age of only 44 years old andrew ( andy) he liked to be called andy had 3 wonderful children 2 boys a girl he was the first one to make me a grandmother with a boy i was getting really better about my life my mental health issues but when andy died by killing himself how does a mum cope with that my youngest son was very fretting me they had a family meeting said that if i came to andys funeral that the family would remove me i wasnt aloud to even send flowers a card even to dill with problems ive always taken things out on myself but i got put in the linden centre chelmsford just because what i did in the past my children had a horrible up bringing which was my fault in out of care andy myself fell out 15 years before he died i will never ever forgive myself for what happened to him the phone call to let me know at 7am couldnt stop crying for that i got put on section 3 family friends need to understand about mental health ive tried to call write to my family but nothing comes back to me so ive just got to live the rest of my life without my 3 children12 grandchildren 4 great grandchildren i hope all of my family have good lifes be happy thats all i need them to know i miss them all im very proud of them all i love ❤ them so much,0
74 90% depression 90% anxiety; with symptoms of ptsd bipolar and red flag for suicide,1
#76 90% depression 90% anxiety,1
i am dreading going to the psychiatrist gonna cost me big bucks,0
i got a lot of help with anxiety and quieting the endless thinking from a book by eckhart tolle called the power of now it made a lot of sense to me and helps me to stay in the present and not worry about the future or let the past hold me back it takes some practice but for me it works good luck to everyone,1
theres free apps for android and iphone that have muscle relaxation exercises and breathing exercises i use it for my anxiety and once i get more calm its easier for me to fall asleep i use pacifica but that could be considered more for mental health than just purely sleep i also invested in a sound machine with a lot of options and i do a nightly routine i have sleep apnea so i use a cpap as well but the breathing exercises meditations sound machine and routines helped me immensely,1
im struggling real hard with this right now,0
most nights i cannot sleep i am usually awake till at least 5am or later every night i can take seroquel and it helps me sleep but then i want to sleep all the time i have anxiety about going to bed but when i finally do i dont get more than 4-5 hours sleep i dont know what to do anymore,1
seroquel makes my restless leg syndrome unbearable and i also have an anxiety disorderthinkin about whether i can get some sleep makes it worse ,1
a wise man once said you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quicker,1
a wise man once said you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quicker,1
battle a lot even with a zopac every night i struggle,0
its been a year since the last pill i took now i face another form of mental illness why god why? i know why i just wanna say "why" if anyone offers me to change who i am to get a new different life with a new identity as a human being i pass no thank you i know its hard to live like this especially when those people who dont understand what youre going through keep bullying you but i wont exchange me my life my struggle with anything else no matter how bad it is how hard it is im here and im still alive and thats enough i dont think anyone else can be as strong as i am today so ill live ill do whatever it takes to stay alive,0
no one should feel guilty for that,0
depression is hard really hard but when you have over active mind and brain which is powerful generator of thought and so anxiety you feel like you run so much so fast that you are dying from exhaustion but still are ruining! it is just,0
has anyone noticed that most people have these feelings based on a situation but due to illness have these ugly emotions of no reason at all? its horrible when they all come together for a meeting i want it all to go away,0
latuda made my depression worse too and i got terrible restless legs,1
good question but i am afraid there is no good answer for this,0
everyone should be saying alive! youre here today still fighting and battling no bell rang yet if youve been battling as many years i have since i was 22 im 46 now still have terrible days i mean scary hearing voices seeing things thinking someone is watching me or following me it is scary very scary ill never get rid of this illness/disease i take everyday like its my last hope everything works out #livelovelaugh,0
i have alarms set in my phone so i never forget my meds if that fils i have a routine breakfast the get dressed and take my meds which are beside my bed with a bottle of water then at night i get changed for bed and take my tablets i take them the same time every day so the routine is pretty much set in stone but the phone alarm is the key to getting a routine started and its important to take meds at the same time everyday so you maintain consistent concentrations,1
horrible i was spaced out driving erratic did nothing,0
tried it became very irritable and angry worse than i already was my psychiatrist said that zoloft is not recommended for people who are bipolar,0
i had zoloft and heard voices and screaming on my ear especially when i was trying to sleep i also used to see shadows and things flying horrible,1
i was on zoloft all of the dosage and it just made me worst the side effects of it is horrible i ended up in the hospital cause of the bad thoughts and before i could start a new medication i had to let zoloft out of my system so the withdrawal was horrible as well i was so sick i couldnt move cause of the withdrawal i dont recommend zoloft to noone i dont like it,0
im on 50 mg now i started zoloft to help my anxiety and panic attacks and i was trying to get pregnant so zoloft was all i could safely take im 33 weeks pregnant still on it it helped me a ton ive had maybe 1 panic attack since starting it my anxiety is calmed even my depression is less im not getting as many nightmares and flashbacks now im more likely to go out of the house and do stuff now im hoping being on it now will help stave off post partum depression but my doctor is prepared just in case it still happens,1
i just started it a week ago im taking it for bad anxiety i really hope it wirks,1
it stopped working for me the initial side effects were horrible,1
yeah its scary as hell! i will never ever let them prescribe that and that happened like 15 years ago,0
hi im on 300 mg of zoloft it took a good 2 yrs to work properly & i still have bad days im also on neulactil for anxiety & high adrenalin i used to be on effexor slow release tablet but i had to stop them due to having heart attack & effexor make ur heart beat fast which my heart could not handle anymore cos i get tacky cardia & angina i dont think theres a tablet out there that will fix depression completly  hey i could be wronge,1
didnt do much of anything for me but was the absolute worst to come off of i lost 30 pounds because i was so sick i couldnt eat anything vertigo was absolutely horrid just an awful experience all around,0
it sent me into a dark mania and i was suicidal terrifying time,0
they wonder why every high profile massacre has a person with a mental disease no one listens to us they have no idea what a panic attack is on top of withdrawal feels like they could not imagine learned recently if i miss 3 appts with my doc he will not see me any more sad,0
i totally understand i remember before i had meds used to be full of pain scared of the chest called panitc attack pain caused anger people would say pray but i never felt much relief it is a mental problem,0
i struggle with rapid cycling bipolar disorder post tramatic stress disorder body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety and i havent been on any medicine for an entire year! it has been so hard for me to make it through the months it is physically and mentally draining i ended up in the hospital two times in 5 months for suicidal attemps and self harm i know its hard right now but we will get through it! if i can make it through than you can too! it might seem dark at times but there is a light at the end of the tunnel! there is a quote that always keeps me going "suicide doesnt end the pain it just passess it on to someone else" message me if you need anything!,1
im sure this is helpful and interesting but my anxiety cant take it! oh the irony!,1
im watching it right now half way true i do notice that it triggers my depression (i have bordeline and alot of trust issues with men which plays a big part in the show due to being sexualized / rape etc ) so i watch it in my own pass and take days in between episode so its not overwhelming,0
i wont watch it out of fear it will trigger me not worth the risk,0
dosage may be to high lithium when husband was on it he could not drink soda and they would do blood work every two weeks to ensure his levels were not too high you can actually get lithium poison if not monitored and can make you feel worse he only was able to drink gatoradewater and ginger ale zoloft is hit or miss but i would ask them to reduce the dosage to 25 and add hydroxizine tartate for sleep and anxiety attacks wellbutrin stay far far away because that shit dont work and makes you feel more suicidal at best lithium i dont recommend because my husband was on it and killed himself i just say the amount he was on was high in correlation between other medications he took it for epilepsy and bipolar disorder but i would ask for the 25 mg of zoloft clonzapam works wonders but most doctors will not prescribe it due to being a narcotic,1
i went out and didnt spend the whole of the next day worrying about what i said,0
great idea i vote for medals instead to be placed around the neck of the recipient by the stigma doubter that hassled them,0
i get 2 stickers today "i survived a panic attack" and "i didnt hide in the bathroom" because i dont hide in the bathroom i hide in the house ,1
i was highly allergic made my anxiety worse and slurred speech sent me back to the hospital more than once dr said to stop taking it immediately,1
i was on 25 mgs for about three weeks and we quit it i had an almost six week withdrawal from it its still going on im very spaced out i keep having awful panic attacks and i cant concentrate on anything i also keep getting extremely confused its awful i hate it,0
i was incredibly paranoid on it had to be taken off quickly,1
ive been in your situation beforeit is horrible! this is legit try goodrxcom or they have an appyou can get huge discounts on your meds! i had to use it a few times especially for my effexor i could go without the others but damn i felt like i was dying without the effexor ended up i only had to pay $12 out of pocket for my script! its worth a shot you can enter your meds and then it gives you pricing at your local pharmaciesyou just go in show them your phone with your "card/member" number that goodrx gives you and you get the meds for that price!,0
i had 3 horrible dreams last night which woke me up so abruptly i just want to feel the most like"myself" as i can,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page thank you you too take care,1
all i can say is stay strong go to church and do your best at talking to friends and family my symptoms are similar depression and anxiety disorders are definitely a battle my prayers are with you,0
i have reoccurring nightmares about mine all the time & have bpd with anxiety & depression its rough needed this thanks,1
i also get anxiety about future consequences or outcomes of things that happened in the past so it is sort of a mixture of past and future,1
wish this worked for those of us that have chemical imbalance induced depression and anxiety :/,1
for me personally it was terrible i felt much much worse my anxiety went up and i was tired all the time,0
i take 225 mg of venlafaxine daily for depression/anxiety and it has worked the best for me i also take it with riperidol which is a mood stabilizer i have never felt better but you also have to go to therapy while taking it it is not a miracle pill the two together is a great mix for me,1
ive personally never had insomnia from it i now take seroquel at night to help with a long term problem with staying asleep the best ever med for anxiety for me has been busparone it worked so well it changed my life i take lamectal (lamotrigine) to stabilizer so my behavior doesnt get extreme venlafaxine as an antidepressant and busparone for anxiety took me about six weeks to get them all to level out i had fatigue headaches and swinging moods but they have pretty much been resolved you must stick with it for 4-6 weeks,1
i have been on it forever definetly helps with deppression the only bad thing is now i cant get off to try anything new because the withdrawl is horrible,0
vemladaxine is antidepressant and not aware it has particularly beneficial sedative side effects venlafaxine is one of the drugs i took for many years for depression / anxiety and like any of these drugs you can feel worse initially because it is helping your brain function warning though do not miss a dosage withdrawal symptoms are horrendous and i mean horrendous,1
been at my psychiatrist todayhe says (after 20+ years bipolar diagnosis) that i have " unstable personality disorder" can you tell me what this means in relation to pip? i havent got the letter yet and am really confused as it seemingly encompasses disacociative disorder with non epileptic episodes/blackouts due to which ive had to surrender my driving licence help!!!!!!!,1
never heard that beforeinteresting i take medication for depression and anxiety i try mindfulnessbut it doesnt work well for me,1
its a good place to start but my depression and anxiety can be rooted in the present as well sometimes more so,1
wish this worked for those of us that have chemical imbalance induced depression and anxiety :/,1
right? i had panic attacks for 10 years for no reason and 3 years ago diagnosed with gad and bipolar 2 mine comes out of nowhere dr said its a chemical imbalance for me not brought on by environmental factors just gotta wait it out until my body regulates i take medication for anxiety but nothing for depression havent had an episode in 2 years hoping i never do again i dont like taking meds and so far every cocktail theyve tried on me ive had horrible reactions to,1
i have bipolar i and anxiety which are treated with medication i also use therapy because medication can only do so much for me its a balancing act and its hard work it would be nice to be able to take a pill and be done with it lol,1
thank you for posting on my post! im just so nervous the last time i was put on anything was zoloft & it pretty much made me almost kill myself! it gave me horrible thoughts,0
each person responds differently to meds so keep that in mind ive been on it for nearing 2 years when first taking it i felt miserable from the side effects but it didnt last long,1
sorryposted before i finished writing! i know they are very expensive to prescribethat is why they are not given out until you have tried other medication they honestly are really good i have not have any problems with them except when i started taking them even then it was just getting used to them i have been on them for several years nowbut from how i am feeling nowi know they work my gp did tell me that if & when i reduce the dosageit should be in the summer & not when its bad weather he said the winter can make people with depression/anxiety feel low anyway i really hope these work for you gabrielle xx,1
they do work for a little while anxiety subsides and generally lift mood downside which docs failed to mention to me extremely addictive and once on them extremely difficult to ever come off i went cold turkey and it was horrendous they have one of the lowest half lifes of all the anti depressantstry going on some forums what i done and you will generally get the same as what im saying ive never felt better since been off them not saying they dont work but it could be a long term commitment once they in your system,0
not sure what meds youre on but you do need an anti psychotic to stop the paranoia and high anxiety its the only base type of drug that works,1
i am the same way  im not confused tho its what my bipolar/ anxiety issues do to me i do ask myself did i take my meds when did i last sleep hope you are on meds and they are working for you if not go see a doctor or psychiatrist and get on a regiment thats trail and error but you can do it be kind to yourself and mindful of your patterns mentally awareness of your mental state truly helps i tell myself stop and listen breathe and smile  keep on keeping on were always here,1
ayewhat if u have bothconstant struggle for me ,0
my personal opinion is that this chart gives a poor description of both it uses professional terms that a lot of people dont know the meaning or understand i also find it interesting that under bipolar it says episode of mania (term a lot of people dont know or understand) associated with euphoria (again - whats that?) and depression and under bpd it says mood (inaccurate information - bpd is not a mood disorder its a personality disorder) changes including irritability sadness feelings of emptiness and anxiety those are all symptoms of depression and seen in mania and where are they measuring if its a personality problem situational mood or something else bpd is most problems due to relationships and how one views the world which this chart says nothing this chart has too many wholes in leaving one still confused i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety more than 10 years ago it was very clear i was manic and depressed and anxious most of the time but continued to have other problems that were untreated and not symptoms of bipolar or anxiety last summer when i went to the hospital was finally diagnosed with bpd it didnt take away the other diagnosis i had was a third disorder its sad that it took so long and of all people wasnt even a dr to find the problem nurse mentioned it before i ever saw the dr based on our interactions and after spending hours with the dr talking about what was going on and what had happened for years dr confirmed and not to mention bipolar is treatable with a combination of medication and counseling techniques bpd is only treatable with therapy and from what ive been told only thing that works is dialectic behavior therapy,1
jo i was wondering the same thing ive always struggled with the right meds for bipolar over 10 years and when i went to the hospital last year they told me i have bpd im still not being treated for it because meds dont treat it and i cant get dbt,0
the way my mental health nurse explained it to me having bpd is like bp but its having a months worth of ups downs and switch feeling is 1 day which is why it is so dangerous but treatment is very similar i was misdiagnoses with bp for years and i kept saying they were wrong now i have a real diagnosis and they can see why i struggle in a day as i dont no how i feel from 1 min to the next people dont no enough about bpd and i have been treated aporlingly by medical professionals sick of judgment now i have a supportive mental health team and i finally think i have a chance to get better not just for me but my children,0
yeah it says bipolar isnt related to life events but when life events get crazy which eventually they always do all hell breaks loose and as someone who has bipolar you definitely can have the irritability and sadness and anxiety because youre a fucking person not just a set of clinical symptoms,0
it really all makes perfect since if you think about it now thats reason to be paranoid,0
i often think maybe i might have borderline personality disorder instead of having bipolar disorder i rarely have hypomania and euphoric episodes i get irritated easily and often feel very anxious doctors are constantly misdiagnosing patients,1
with bpd sometimes medication isnt helpful you can have it to help with the anxiety & depression with it but the actual illness is about learning coping strategies and dbt therapy ~sandi~,1
o i wish i had the book now it sounds so good its a shame that i dont have anyone in my hometown i can talk to when im feeling low but its nice talking to you bambi stell you sound like a lovely person ,0
dont listen to people that know nothing about the illness i can understand how you feel like you arent yourself its like your cant control your thoughts or emotions my daughter suffers bpd so i see her struggling every day you need to find a good psychologist that specialises in mood disorders and does dbt therapy medication can help but not always~sandi~,0
im sorry for your loss i lost my mum to cancer 10 yrs ago does it get easier? yes and no i had a love hate relationship with my mum and one of my greatest regrets is having an argument with her in hospital and it was the last time she was able to speak there are always times when vulnerable like when i am sick in trouble needing advice etc where it seems worse but then on my good days ill find myself think about good times it will always have an affect on you but its how you choose to remember thats important think about grief counselling it helps,0
thank you so much i have a diagnosis of depression and anxiety i basically sit and wait for my next anxiety/ panic attack,1
i was highly allergic made my anxiety much worse slurred speech and sent me back to the hospital more than once,1
i would check your diagnosis as suggested by others to confirm if you are bp1 or 2 (from what you said sounds like bp2 when depressive episodes more frequent and hypomania episodes rather than mania or have bpd you could have cooccurring diagnosis such as anxiety depression compulisive behaviour etc which meds can help or you,1
a therapeutic dosage for some people is 200mg for other people it can be as high as 400mg a day try not to be freaked out by all the side effects mentioned yet if you notice anything unusual tell your dr immediately im wondering if some of you are mistaking this drug for an anti-depressant lamictal is used as a mood stabilizer in psychology if a bipolar person takes an anti-depressant without taking a mood stabilizer itll cause a manic/hypomanic episode the lamictal helps the mood swings think of your mood like a pendulum the lamictal keeps you from swinging too far either way keeps the scary lows from being so severe this type of drug is necessaryeven when you feel better do not stop taking your medication unless directed by your dr i have tried almost every mood stabilizer they make as well as anti-seizure medication for mood stabilization in total i have been on it about 15 years they have tried others but always go back to lamictal hope this helps good luck to all of you:-),1
one of the only meds so far that has worked for me it definitely helps and im impatiently waiting to get to my target dose so i can feel the full effects of being level and "happy",1

please go to a hospital and get some help it may be scary but they can help if you let them ive been cutting for 20+ years i go for long periods of times without cutting but i relapse from time to time it is a powerful addiction because the release of the endorphins from the cutting is almost euphoric please get helpyou deserve to find better ways to deal with lifes struggles you can do itive been cut-free for years its worth the effort praying for you god bless you,0
first you need to find some way to get you those feelings workout self harming a way to redirect your focus something you might like to do read a book colour paint research family tree information hiking journaling something that can perhaps inspire you in a more positive manner than you need to find someone you are comfortable with communicating with if it is a parent a relative a telephone hotline you need to sort out some of the chaotic feelings you are dealing with i find talk therapy with a psychologist seems a bit hard but i found one i loved and all these feelings may start pouring out and it releases some of that anxiety and tension you need to find a good doctor you after comfortable with to help you with the possibility of meds if thats what they think you need having choices is really important and i hope you realize you arent alone just this year ive had such horrible lows ive been so overwhelmed ive self harmed but im determined to be happy im fighting so hard dont feel ashamed to say how you feel or ask for help dont forget to take care of yourself it can get better❤️,0
this person is being 100% honest they obviously want help but dont know where to turn these pages are made to help us when we feel like we have no one else i hope you personally never struggle with self-harm because its addicting just like cigs alcohol drugs eating starving and everything else sometimes when youre completely down you dont think straight and need help i know if im extremely depressed i cant function at all,0
this is so true i have been suffering this condition for years finally in the last three i have been stable which is such a blessing it has taken me such a long time to learn and cope with this and not identify myself with it i now know how to get through day to day life without it being such a roller coaster for me im am so glad and grateful that i no longer feel shame for having this mental illness,0
i take 1200 milligrams of seroquel does out 3 times a day if i would have stopped taking the seroquel i would have major withdrawals which is what sounds like what youre going through if you havent spoken to your doctor about coming off the seroquel i suggest that you do so and you two can make a plan to slowly come off of it to avoid having withdrawal symptoms,0
im finding a new psychiatrist i felt like my last one didnt know what to do with me anymore and yea im struggling,0
unfortuately a lot of partners do leave it adds to the anxiety & overthinking but im gradually getting there,0

ohmagosh for a second there i thought i wrote this post nope not me please understand i do truly understand not only do i comprehend your struggle i deeply understand im not gonna try to convince you to believe or pray to fictional creatures or entities what i humbly suggest is that you reach within to your own strengths and develop a belief in yourself first if youd like to visit privately please feel free to message me i will gladly share my own battles with suicidal thoughts & other forms of stinkn-thinkn,0
i find bible passages help me prayerand knowing gods name (knowing who i am praying too) i have lived with depression most of my life  since being a small child and now in my late 50s bible passages that can help “jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit”​—psalm 34:18 “throw your burden on jehovah and he will sustain you never will he allow the righteous one to fall”​—psalm 55:22 “i jehovah your god am grasping your right hand the one saying to you ‘do not be afraid i will help you’”​—isaiah 41:13 “never be anxious about the next day”​—matthew 6:​34 “let your petitions be made known to god; and the peace of god that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts”​—philippians 4:​6 7 ,0
if i understand correctly you are feeling suicidal because you are alone and you are struggling your disorder it is also important to remember that our disorders do not define us they dont define us because it is how we deal with them and how we move forward that does! a good support network is very important maybe going to see a psychologist or registered counsellor could help but if those just dont do it for you there are many forms of therapy including art and anything creative look into it its something that could be worth looking into,0
im sorry times are tough i can relate i have bpd and major depressive disorder with anxiety ive tried everything out there and still i sit trying to creep through each day,0
reaching out for help shows you have not totally lost the will to live i also have no friends due to my conditions (bipolar depression anxiety) and struggle with these feelings often i know there is someone out there that i will meet that will be a good friend and i will find them you are recently diagnosed so give it time to get the best medications for you you will feel better when that happens maybe a psychologist to talk to?,0

my dvds have to be organized (if its a series they have to be in order) and straightened and all facing the same way if one gets disturbed it bugs me and i have to fix it i check the oven numerous times to make sure its off fold towels a certain way & make sure their straight when i hang a towel on a towel bar in the bathroom it gas to be straight and the tag cant be showing when i get ready to go out i have to get ready in order like brush my hair first put my contacts in brush teeth etc i cant touch things with my bare hands (that other ppl have touched & also i dont like shaking hands) i either have to use gloves or sanitizer i drive the same route to get to and from a familiar place i cant sit where someone has just sat; it feels too weird; i have to switch seats,0
i also have obsessive thoughts a lot,1
god bless you angela raineyi can identify with every word you wroteso i know exactly how you feel i wear myself out in my own mind life gets so confusing to me sometimes that i cant manage to have one clear thoughtright now my brain is so scrambled its making me upset & nauseousoh lord ,0
i definitely find it to alot worse when i start/am unstable i have to clean the house top to bottom and throw out a heap of things it almost feels like a cleansing and it feels like its the only thing left that i have control of im very particular about where things are put in my pantry how my food is cut and cooked how the toilet is cleaned etc however in saying that when things are really bad its only a few of those things that i cant let go of everything else goes to shit because i can barely make it off the couch however my mind is still racing and its difficult to get any real sleep so hard to explain because i cant understand it myself i have bipolar 2 anxiety and ocd lucky me lol,0
it took me a few years to be completely rid of the brain shakesick,1
i dont know i take cymbalta as well and i cant get past the dizzys i make my doctor put me back on it unfortunately im at the highest dose for therapeutic use little scared of what they will have to use next i hate withdrawl,1
never be ashamed to talk and be in control of it,0
i think most people say "im bipolar" not because they are defining themselves but because it is easier than stating "i am diagnosed with bipolar disorder" every time they are seeking advice from people who can relate or when they reply to a comment and want the person posting to know what their diagnosis is and whether or not they can relate to their situation and or medication/treatment choices im not sure what exactly the purpose behind your post is but i hope it was not meant to judge or put down anyone who may not express themselves in the same manner as yourself i would like to think that pages such as this are meant for people suffering from mental illness to have a place to be free of negative judgment a place where we can relate to one another support one another seek advice from one another and most importantly speak freely without fear of judgment especially because outside of these pages we with mental disabilities continue to be looked upon negatively we need one anotheror at least i need you all lets love and support one another and yes im bipolar❤,0
exactly and im glad people are coming down on the other side of the coin on this i dont need a guilt trip for being colloquial if im telling my friends im having a manic episode i say "im manic" ill probably type the full proper language out of fear of chiding from the ableism gods but who needs that bs?,0
i liked what you said you have a good point i say im bipolar when i had cancer i never said im cancer but to me saying im bipolar is no more shameful than saying im diabetic its not a label - its an explanation,0
i have depression anxiety and ptsd i have a sister who is schizophrenic when it comes to word phrasing it would be correct to either say she is schizophrenic or she has schizophrenia both phrases are correct i know depression is not the same as being bi polar that wasnt my point,1
only a doctor knows what they should be you and you really i used to be on depakote and it did the exact same thing to me very irritable but it also made me very angry when i would take it so i stopped on my own taking it and it seems like yes i still have to deal with depression and anxiety and being bipolar at times but i would rather do with the sad and lonely in my heart and in my mind my soul and everything i do being judged unaccepted id rather just die honestly im so tired of this life because everytime i try to do right it seems that i never cared or its never good enough for anyone not for my family my brothers my sisters my girlfriend her friends anybody i dont care any more myself or maybe i do care too much and i just dont know how to express it so im giving up,0
you dont say what your diagnosis is but you are taking meds for a range of mental health illnesses depokate is primarily for bipolar latuda is primarily to treat schizophrenia cumbalta is and anti depressant ritalin is a stimulating mainly for adhd impulsive behaviour and xanax anxiety panic disorder you are not only over mediated but combination of some of these meds are potential dangerous and will coutaract each other i would seriously find out what your diagnosis do you have schizophrenia or experience psychotic symptions such as hearing voices hallunications delusions paranio or bipolar? if not i would determine why you on these meds you need to research the meds you take,1
i would say over medicated is an understatement but that is purely my personal opinion i can tell you from my experience though that i too was on a huge combination of meds started​feeling overmedicated and stopped taking them huge mistake i now only take 1500 mg of depakote at bedtime because it does have side effects that i dont notice taking it at bed time klonopin for anxiety at night as well as my zoloft at night,1
if you only get to see the doc for 15 minutes id say that isnt acceptable it takes some time to listen to your symptoms and see if you are doing better i am not a doc either but checked with a pharmacist friend he feels its definitely possible you are being overmedicated and your doc is just throwing more meds at you instead of better meds that work ask that doc exactly what each of them is for ritalin? it rarely works to stop racing thoughts and anxiety find out what each is for tell doc that the combo isnt working for you and ask about alternatives do your own research too look up each of the meds and empower yourself with knowledge,1
i used to worry about what they give you to take but they are highly trained people who do know what they are doing so best to stick to them to ask questions as dangerous to listen to all different people as these are strong meds you cant just stop them they need lowering by the phychartrist,1
not sure about the meds but you only see them 15 min? i see mine 1hr/month bpd is complicated and id really doubt in 15 min they could get an accurate feel for your current situation,0
from this medication list im going to assume that youre being treated for bipolar disorder if that is true then you should not be on the cymbalta as this can make your bipolar worse the xanax (if taken everyday) latuda and depakote can be contributing to your fatigue the ritalin can be contributing to the anxiety which im assuming is what the xanax is for im not a psychiatrist and am not yet a health professional (currently still in pharmacy school) so i can only give you a personal opinion and not a medical opinion but in my personal opinion yes you are being overmedicated but i certainly have seen patients on more meds and bipolar (and mental health in general) is a complex disease state to treat as for your depakote you should get used to the new medication anywhere from 1 to 2 months if the irritability and fatigue do not go away by then or if they are affecting your daily life you should go talk to your psychiatrist about these effects and hopefully he/she will change up your therapy **edit: please please please dont stop any of your medications without discussing them with your prescriber first**,1
sounds like the depakote is nullifying the effects of the ritalin youll be irritable if youre very tired i dont all the other drugs your on except depakote talk to your doctor soon,0
that is a lot to mix and match without knowing what ur problem is its hard to say if they are overkill i know they all do different things but i would spk to them see if there are better combination drugs or if any are really needed as sometimes u can take 1 that end up helping for a few things and u then dont need the others so much its always worth asking if u are worried they are giving u to many a specially if u get a lot of side effects if ur getting irritable and tired do bring that up as its not worth it i had that with 1 of mine now im on something different its so much better but dont be afraid to voice ur opinion and if u feel u need more support see about a mental health nurse as they see u reg basis i see mine every few weeks and they are so helpful,0
some people will not acknowledge that depression anxiety and panic attacks are an illness imagine they will think different when it happens to them let me reassure you it is an illness it takes seconds just too ask how someone is try it maybe one day you may be in that position wondering if any of your friends and famiy care about you,1
ive been bipolar fori cant remember most of my 41 years of life it is truly part of me its an illness for sure ive had it so long and will die with it im not going to hide from it im not ashamed of it a spade is a spade i am bipolar regardless of how anybody else wants to put it,0
what a love of god to show and share shame on your grudge may forgiveness and mercy be blessed to you,0
whats a holiday they dont get it wasnt easter for us yesterday it was sunday which was just like saturday and friday and so on these annual events (holidays for them) are just another day for us to be even more anxious about our day and give heed to us hiding in seclusion from our family they will never understand it best thing to do is stop expecting them too and stop subjecting yourself to the exposure if it,0
if hes not currently seeking help this sounds to me like hes not open to it so you need to get as far away from him as possible bipolar is a life long illness & if hes not seeking help things will not get better will not get better your just trying to rationalise a way to keep the relationship going & you just cant in this situation even medicated & counselled he will continue to have episodes they may be less violent it i doubt it very much in this situation because he knows he has control over you through fear,0
sorry to distract from original post of abuse when referring to myself i say i am bipolar it is a personal choice to decide it is woven through the very core of me i am not ashamed of it nor quiet about it i am medicated and have worked hard to remove co-existing personality disorder now cured of that (yes perdis are curable with hard work) i am high functioning most of the time when im not i take time off from life so-to-speak to recover most people except employers know of my struggles at least depression,0
you need to prioritize your physical safety give what support you can from a safe distance or with a group of friends mental illness is a reason for his behavior but not an excuse: dont let yourself be injured or threatened,0
my best friend is a lot like me he and i both have ptsd bi polar along with a few other things we can fight pushing the boundaries and still end laughing maybe not the same day but mostly hes got a very violent temper and so do i although i wouldnt put my hands on anyone he would weve had some really beyond boundaries fights and he wouldnt ever lay a hand on me im safe with him first guy in my life im safe with leave just leave being with someone controlling and violent regardless of bipolar is not ok dont let him hurt you it wont get better and its your life and your peace of mind you need to protect i learned this way too late and wish i had left my husband in the first year of marriage instead i stayed lived in fear and much very horrific abuse for 15 years he finally was sentenced to 14-28 yrs in federal prison hes been there 10 he gets out in 4 im back to being afraid and so much more just go get out for you,0
i myself am bipolar and so was my ex we both had two opposite reactions when we were having "off days" he wouldnt want to be alone where i hate being bothered we ended up not working out because when i wanted to be alone hed nag me and get mad because i would go to another room it eventually got to the point hed corner me and id start panicking if that would happen hed start spitting in my face and slapping me abuse isnt a relationship if someone loved you he wouldnt put his hands on you i stayed with my ex way longer than i needed to i stayed until it was life or death if i was you id get out of the relationship you can love someone but your life is way more important than to be abused by them,0
he obviously needs help and i hope he is willing to get it but at this point i dont think its your responsibility and you definitely shouldnt tolerate such terrifying abuse,1
hold on tight please you are not alone if you want to talk do not hesitate (mp),0
im in a similar boat im alone i have bpd depression and bad anxiety in everything going every friendship fails and relationships are messed up unfortunately you just got to push your way through hold that head up! try to make a life you want thats what im doing even though is a massive struggle chin up i know life is tough you can do it believe me i can relate to your pain,0
sure!! this website is for anyone if you have questions or if you struggle with issues or know someone who is we all have been there and we are all here for each other!!!,0
i am so sad to see all of these comments about loved ones leaving or think it over before you commit i understand that its hard for the partner to watch their loved one go through this i have bipolar depression 2 the leaving or doubts about life with someone who suffers this its going to make the person fall deeper into the darkness my boyfriend understands me yes its hard but he supports me and helps me up out of the dark i usually have more lows than highs but hes with in both,0
im pretty much alone i dont have any close friends anymore and my family doesnt really want anything to do with me im alone 95% of the time and im struggling getting used to it its hard not to have anyone to turn to or talk with,0
i have bipolar 2 and my husband doesnt its hard for him i try but its hard for me to control it sometimes i feel guilty for marrying him sometimes but he tells me he cant imagine life without me i would think it over specially if you are not fully committed yet its harder on my love ones then me at times thats why i always tell him that if it gets to be too much let me go self help comes first no matter what side your on read about it research go to a meeting called nami for info then only you can make that decision it is not easy but its worth the love ❤️ ,0
its nice from you to seek advice i believe there are different levels or severity of bipolar but at the end we all deal with the same monster also it can be mixed with anxiety depression add adhd some can function and some cannot its like not knowing how you are going to feel tomorrow or 3 hours from now,1
when they are upset remember its not you its something they have to work through in their head just listen and comfort them,1
confusing as the change between up and down can be as if a switch has been thrown thats what it feels like to me,0
so sorry dont be afraid to see a doctor if you havent already praying for you it can be tough tomorrow hope for a better day hugs,1
still learning who mine are my best friend was my wife she chose to move on and tell me i needed to figure out my own problems my depression and anxiety were not things she wanted to walk through with me i dont blame her i know dealing with me must have been hell while unintentional she felt unloved and uncared for,0
john jackson give her time my wife did a lil bit what she was reading was about depression tho and anxiety not bipolar theres such a big difference in them bipolar / schizophrenia shes the one needing education do you your first good luck to you my friend,1
same for me i talked about this in another post but today my x wife is my best friend and supporter she like a lot of peoples significant others dont read up on our illness its hard for us to explain and when we do talk about this they dont think that can happen in our heads i was paranoid hearing voices seeing things thought people were watching me or following me it sucked that i lost the best thing to ever come into my life she gave me a beautiful gift tho my son youd think in todays world people would be more educated and think before they judge sad and hurtful ill never stop fighting either should anyone god bless #livelovelaugh,0
i understand how you feel my husband gets upset with me about my anxiety he doesnt support me and it really hurts he doesnt understand its something i cant control :(,0
please everyone just take one day at a time dont ever live in future ive learned just as this post says " who my real friends/family are "  live everyday like its your last i mean that in a very respectful and good way im still seeing who still there for me they drop like flies why because they dont understand what were fighting in our heads  for the most part with me i can only say its me my own demons inside its a fucking scary ass ride excuse my language no ones ever alone look for support groups seek new dr get a different dr and maybe the meds youre on are not for you keep trying and fighting the bell hasnt rung yet for any of us good luck and god bless #livelovelaugh,0
julie completely understand all of this my parents (and us) are going through it also my stepdad was given 6 months-a year last october your thoughts and feelings are exactly what hes been dealing with and its so difficult to watch and try to put ourselves in his shoes i cant imagine how he or you feel he has finally come to accept this fate and has made (somewhat) of peace within he does still worry about when hes gone and if my mom will be ok im sure thats one of your main concerns tohow could it not? i feel for you two and think of you often ,0
thanks for your bravery i too feel like you im coming up on the end of my life expectancy and am scared as well i remember however that its just a best guess live to the fullest every day works for me i hope you find peace my friend,0
and the person who said rip i found that rude julie is still alive and i have hope in her that she will be alive tomorrow and so on dont say rip scare her why dont you julie sweetheart i send you the biggest warmest hugs ill be thinking of you and keep posting on here ok xx,0
julie i cant even begin to imagine what you go through on a daily basis so im not gonna say that i do but for whatever its worth i acknowledge your pain and your fears for all of life uncertainties your reasons are valid but please dont allow that to take time away from today but most importantly from this moment cherish every valuable minute that can be spent loving your loved ones,0
i have had anxiety my entire adult life since my early 20s i am pretty much anti-meds myself and never take medication unless i really really need to when my anxiety level is high i need to take my anti-anxiety medication meditation and yoga and exercise is great im all for it but when i am in the throes of a panic attack they would not help me at all in fact i am fairly sure that would just make me more anxious what i need to do is take a pill and go somewhere where i can calm myself down period end of sentence,1
anxiety medication xanax ???,0
i forgot to take mine today i really wish i hadnt ive been out all afternoon and even with my bf and my service dog my anxiety is much higher than ive gotten used to handling,1
im trying to keep a promise made after my last failed attempt each day is a struggle days filled with pain sorrow and yes despair pray for all who must fight this fight pray for me,0
they are doing studies now and saying taking a probiotic daily is good for depression anxiety and order mood disorders - a healthy gut keeps the immune system happy and also helps with the seratonin levels - kids with autism as well its worth trying i think,1
weed only with bi-polar? thats insane advice you trying to make her manic? if its just anxiety i agree 100% if its depression weed only masks the problem it does not treat it after the high your back at square one,1
i did but just like any other antidepressant i didnt respond well to it and made me more depressed ive never had a good response to antidepressants and a psychiatrist from the hospital said she would never give them to me because my symptoms would not be a good fit for them anxiety and mania medications work wonders for me and balance out my depression antipsychotics have the same reactions as antidepressants they all sedate me 24/7 so that i cant function,0
definitely communicate dont wait until way down the road to bring something up that bothers you during your engagement is a good time to practice and explore how to communicate during a stressful event utilize that!! it will help your marriage go smoother because it will help make communicating a habit,1
as some have suggested its best to communicate with him and he may be upset when he reads this as your posts may come up in his feed its sad when you feel unloved but many people face depression without a partner so you should discuss your feelings with him if you are engaged you must have trust and feel able to discuss your feelings as for money its immaterial and should not equate to how much someone loves you its sometimes more rewarding just stopping in and listening to music and smiling as for every moment of sadness there will be a new day on the horizon if you can talk to one another you can celebrate everyday and be content knowing that you are not alone concentrate on the good things you share x,0
i would start with your dr maybe you need a increase in doseor different medicine with your new life changes comes stress stopbreatheuse what you have learned keep your head up!,1
youre under a lot of stress and that will really compound your depression and moods the most "normal" people are greatly affected by these types of situations it would be so good if you could see a psychiatrist because they are much more knowledgeable about these medications you may be able to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner and it would be less expensive just keep breathing sweet pea you will make it!,1
i would imagine the fact you are looking for teaching posts is causing some stress and anxiety you - most people would feel under pressure in this situation so its not abnormal to feel like that you should write down exactly how you are feeling to try and identify the trigger which may enable you to move forwards and try and address it your gp could increase your dosage as 20 mg is lowest dose of prozac or there are many it her anti depressants which are also good got anxiety such as sertraline (zoloft),1
i cant and wont comment on your medications since i am not a doctor relocating searching for work and just being a teacher are stressful enough use the cbt as it best applies to you discuss medications with professionals and your feeling and plans with all friends available attempt to do what you feel is best for you trust your judgment good luck,1
that is a lot of pressure to be under looking for a new job is extremely stressful what you are going through is normally very challenging to someone not on meds you should talk to your dr about adjusting your meds and get to a therapist so you can talk through what is going on in your life,0
i agree that exercise meditation yoga and positive thinking are good for mental health however there is more to mental health than exercise and positive thinking depression is real and can kill if not properly treated everyone responds differently gp generally are not knowledgeable about mental illness i was getting refills from mine and my meds actually should have been changed but she didnt have the expertise to treat me i had a spiral down hill with many trips to the hospital because i was so suicidal and mania so high mixed with anxiety it actually got much worse go see a psychiatrist counseling is helpful sometimes i get frustrated because i feel like the techniques are blaming me for being sick i think its learning to use them appropriately which is not always taught correctly,1
i would talk to the gp and consider more therapy sometimes we just need a refresher on the techniques for helping ourselves i have no doubt that the job stressors are whats causing this relapse so just go talk through it with someone,1
i thought this was supposed to be a place to come for support telling a person who is already struggling in a deep amount of pain that "no one cares" is even more hurtful and triggering sounds like some people are stuck in their own dysfunction projecting it onto others and dont know the skill of when to be quiet,0
ive been with my husband for 3 years & let me tell you weve been thru a lot of struggles dealing with finances we have both come to realize that monetary things are not as important as just being together the most important things come from the heart not the wallet,0
tell him how you feel but honestly if you expect to be given something or have something special done for you every 5 months you will be truly disappointed! think about the good things does he treat you right every other day? does he show his love every other day? my husband and i have been together for 17 years its only in the past 2-3 yrs that hes actually mad an effort to celebrate our anniversaries! he tells me he loves me ever day and kisses me every day so im nit worried about what he doesnt do on the anniversaries! can take a while to realise the small things matter more but once you do realise its such a relief!,0
nobody gives a fuck a fucking mental health hotline "counselor" told me to go to a fucking urgent care place in a strip mall i had an episode so bad it scared my wife to death and i was escorted from my house by the police the next dayive known this person all my life and now shes gone just like that my cat is with me in a fucking motel in another state and thats fucked his life up i break everything with a heart beat im tired of trying ive lost the battle and the war im tired of waking up,0
this more than applies to my everyday struggles but i keep fighting it thank you to all who understand,0
describing me to the tthe struggle is real,0
this is me fibromyalgia restless leg syndrome ibs brain fog diabetes so people now know that most of the time i wont answer my front door if they knock uninvited,0
except i havent ive never one a battle or faced a fear all ive done is wether them is to hold on until they give up and give me a few days of rest so they come back my suffering will be fresh again,0
ok i could have been the one who wrote this post back in 2001 the most important thing is to find the resources available to you on campus i went to umass amherst and they had psychologists and psychiatrists right on campus that took my insurance a good place to start would probably be with your ra there are places to go right on campus biggest thing: find a professional who you can talk to and if you feel that they arent a good fit try someone else not all doctors are for everyone and trust is so important dont be afraid to find one that fits i struggled so much before i got the help i needed you need to be patient with yourself and take care of *you* first looking back i wish i had taken a semester or 2 off to get myself settled i felt too much pressure not to though which wasnt the best for me i missed so many classes it was ridiculous i withdrew from classes and bombed entire semesters the simple act of moving to college triggered my depression ive struggled since there are a lot of resources please please take advantage of them also keep in mind that afsporg and namiorg are excellent places to talk to people theres even a chat on afsporg if memory serves! you can pm me on here if youd like to hang in there (excuse any typos) -terri,1
hello thank you for sharing here im glad you decided to post and open up you have a lot going on right now and feeling overwhelmed is completely normal you still have a month left and in that time you can onlydo what you can do take care of yourself first that is the most important after semester you will have the summer to regenerate sometimes when i have anxiety i find a quiet space that gives me comfort if you had to redo this semester it wouldnt be ideal but if you were feeling better it would be worth it please know that you are not alone there are a lot of other students that feel the same way please reach out to someone close and talk about how you feel there areresources on campus also you can text 741-741 for text support you can private message me i would be happy to talk more you are not alone keep fighting,0
hello my dear friend realistically you can’t expect to make it through school without having to deal with some kind of stress granted too much stress can be oppressive wise king solomon wrote: “mere oppression may make a wise one act crazy” (ecclesiastes 7:7) but you need not let stress drive you crazy the key is learning how to manage stress effectively and if youre suffering from depression theres help out there please dont give up you have a good whole life ahead of you ❤️ hope youll find beneficial as it did others this timely article im sharing with you ❤️ ,0
youre feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and thats entirely understandable and youre not alone talking about this helps tremendously and well done for taking the step of reaching out some ideas that may help you are: meditation light exercise - just going for a walk around the block will help to give you some "space" in your head so you can focus and concentrate more keep your water intake at optimum levels and dont skip breakfast above all be kind to yourself this is a challenging time for you you have everything you need to get through this even if it may feel that you dont i wish you all the best keep talking about it and allow yourself to experience the underlying emotions the awful symptoms you have will subside i promise it may help to make a list of the studying you need to do and then prioritise it based on what you know well and what you dont take baby steps and before you know it youll be finished studying dont beat yourself up it is obviously important to you to finish this year and pass and im sure you will with flying colours,0
go see a counselor on campus or make an appointment with a psych doctor in your area its normal to struggle when you make a big change in your life (like starting college) but if it starts to interfere with your ability to live life--as this clearly is--you shouldnt be ashamed to get help please reach out and get professional help i was scared when i first did but they are honestly there to help you,1
sometimes its one breath at a time in order to walk through stressful times youre stronger than you think!,0
you are not alone i have exactly the feelings you describe every day my family thinks i can just let it go and get over it too let us on this site help you navigate the storm i have received a lot of support and understanding on here the belief that feelings like yours and mental illnesses​ are results of chemical imbalances in the brain has been understood for a while the challenge is to get the right meds to restore the proper balance of seratonin (the main happy feeling substance for the brain)  i also take effexor and works for me but everyone is different try to have patience because finding the right meds for you can take a while some meds can take 4 weeks to get to theraputic levels and help my racing thoughts are from anxiety and it sounds like yours are too take some time to research symptoms of anxiety and i think you will find they describe those racing thoughts and worries you describe the most helpful medication i take is busparone it has done wonders for relieving my racing thoughts and worries about everything thats what is specifically for i take 30 mg in the morning and at night but started at 15mg anxiety has lots of faces look it up in several places i had no idea what i was experiencing was anxiety let your doc know your symptoms tell him " i think i am having a lot of anxiety because" there are several benzodiazapines ( like klonopin) that some prescribe but beware of them because they are addictive and coming off them is no fun busparone has been my savior you need to have a doc that listens look up depression and anxiety and see how they relate to each other best advice i can give know yourself! take control of your own recovery!! ,1
shame on people for telling your crazyits an illness so dont believe them when they say that to you my dr also put me on citalopram 20mgthat wasnt strong enough so he increased to 40mgit helps but makes me incredibly tired after about 3 hrs and i have to take a naphope you feel better soonremember there are millions of people just like usyour not alone#bipolarlove,0
u r not crazy or alone! seeking help is the right choice! sounds like r going through the same thing i am diagnosed bipolar and trying to get through a major depressive stage but its been super scary ive cut to release the internal pain or hope it will ive gone to the er i constantly trying to get my brain to be a peace and the obsessive thoughts to go away and almost relapsed a few times to make it go away! i keep trying to get better but it like a storm warning to my family and the doctors and they keep ignoring it but try to stay strong and keep fighting to find out what is going on and get the proper meds to at least ease some of it and go to therapy or join a support group or messages me! talking to people going through the same thing or have gone through it also helps! u are in my thoughts ,0
i love the compassion ive read here in a world full of negative and unsettling this is great to read,0
hugs and prayers dont hesitate to get professional help you are worth it,1
1 big hugs 2 you are not alone 3 take the medication as it should help it will take time for the medication to work if it doesnt dont give up hope ask to see a psychiatrist they are better at diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues it is a chemical imbalance in the brain and its nothing to be ashamed of i am bipolar and the medications i take let me be me again i laugh and have fun and im social again but i lost 10 years-10 very important years being stubborn and figuring i could out will the feelings of sadness be brave try the meds - i know you are scared but it does get better the fact you have reached out and asked for help makes you very brave if you get the urge to attempt suicide please go to the closest emergency room as they will be able to help you or call a help line,1
we might not know each other but please dont hesitate to send me a message if you need more advice or just an outlet to talk to ❤️ ,1
i too am struggling and i know its scary no one understands and you feel yourself slipping medication is scary scary to need it scary side effects scary that you might not be able to function without it once established but i can tell you this i struggle with my damn meds every day but without them i wouldnt be here as for counseling or therapy it does not make you crazy or weak or any thing other than aware you need someone to talk to! your mother comes from a different generation with a different spin ignore her get the help you need,0
oh please like one can meditate quietly when your mind is racing one minute and shut off the next this person is is in turmoil right now and it seems like he/she is alone in the chaos of their mind meditation? sorry but this isnt a solution for a person in this current state just saying,0
r u really serious i used to know an awesome professional but i dont really know them anymore fear is a disease in it self thats what some ancient ansesstors believed but who knows thats way in the past also trust in yourself,0
im on efexor xr 375mg i take 150mg in the morning 75mg at lunch and 150mg at night plus im on clonazapam and epilum but we will leave them out for now efexor i have split doses because i get the brain zaps it feels like your brain is being zapped and it kinda travels down your body and feels like your eyes are shaking the split had kinda helped but not really i sweat so bad sometimes that people ask me if im ok at work and wake up in a pool of sweat ive been on it for about 7 years and scared to come off as ive heard its horrible i also get severe gastrointestinal issues ive only really had them since efexor the nausea might be to do with that i have ibs had gallstones and gord (reflux) something to be mindful of i hope it works for you as it does work for a lot of people,0
the effexer hasnt been working for me so the doc is weaning me off of it and ive got terrible brain zap its almost debilitating and makes me super irritable and ill snap at people i work with and just start crying for no reason and get suicidal thoughts that wont go away i hope this medication works for you its extremely difficult coming off of it for me,1
effexor was the worst for me ive been taking different ones for almost 10 years and i gained so much weight side effects were horrible my vision got bad my memory im on celexa now,0
i was very nauseous for two weeks the until it settled i stayed on the venlefaxine for a year and a half and it eventually stopped working so my doc upped my dosage and it was a horrible experience once he did it manifested my depression more and more so i was weined off of it and switched to ciprilex 10 mg and it has made a huge difference i love the way it has helped me cope and stopped my bad thoughts i highly recommend ciprilex it has little to no side effects and didnt make me nauseous at all good luck,1
omgi cannot take effexorit made me paranoid as crapi didnt even want my bf to go to work every morningi begged him to stay homei will never take that again,0
i changed from mirtazapine to sertraline to now effecor and find it the most effect for me if i ever miss a dose i do go very dizzy and confused but it goes away when i take it again,1
it was the first medication i was prescribed after two weeks i was shaking uncontrollably so stopped taking it but everyone is different so give it a try,1
have you tried lsd? im not joking ive struggled with being bipolar and depression my entire life so has my mum ive watch her down so many various kinds of pills and the only things thats happened is she lost all her teeth (side effect) i found reasons i might not be awful i still feel like that sometimes but the feeling i had then are still there its like "hey maybe you dont suck" i was always scared of lsd but its honestly just a great introspective experience its like smoking weed but a bit more visual i see now why theyre trying to get it approved for ptsd therapy,0
i was on effexor for 14 yrs but after having problems & having heart attack they took me off them changed to zoloft because effexor makes anxiety worse can give u high adrenaline outrages it makes ur heart rate go very fast also i had so much trouble comming off them bad experience but eveeyone is affected differently,1
is effexor xr you want the extended release but if you start taking it need you need to take it consistently because if you miss a dose i know i have horrible nightmares and became spaced out i know when i doctor added adderall to my med line up in 2010 it was a life changer for me it boots the antidepressants i dont feel antidepressants or mood stabilizers alone do crap they just keep us down need something to boost us up keeps me awake functioning and productive totally different person got this information from carrier clinic saved my life,0
yes welcome to our club of family denial wasnt until my 2nd hospitalization and the change my husband and children saw in me i became a functioning wife and mother again and are thrilled to see me out if my bed in a daily basis still have my panic attacks occasionallyband can get manic at times but the clonzepam can even that out dont ever let anyone tell you its not real or its a cop out shake it off or go for a walk its a chemical imbalance nothing to be ashamed of took years of er visits until finally someone got me the help i needed i got so tired of trying to explain bipolar manic depression panic anxiety disorder to everyone i printed out material on it and gave it to them to read those who cared did those who didnt are not in my life anymore we have a hard enough time trying to deal with our illness and managing ourselves let alone having to try and babysit the "well" people through it tell them to get a support group and educate themselves my kids could tell you anything about my mental illness today and are not ashamed,0
thank you for this validation! just today i was having to state my case to a family member who believes bipolar or depression is just a cop out to function normally believes meds only make it worse i tried explaining why this med helps in combo w my other meds all dr prescribed but it was just a losing battle its awful when your own mother doesnt validate mental illness as a legitimate illness like any other but i digress im grown dont require her approval or support even but all the judgment and blaming me for everything that is negative in everyones life and accusing me of using bipolar and anxiety as an excuse i could certainly do without this is a big enough battle to fight daily dont need more on top to fight im learning to let it go doesnt really matter in the end how she treats me anyway yeah?,1
i was taking 225mg daily but i hated the side effects especially the excessive sweating! i weaned myself off it eventually but even that was horrible its a very toxic drug in my opinion,0
my sweating has stopped now im off venlaflaxine rianne shaw its a horrible drug!,0
i literally couldnt cope with it it was so embarrassing!,0
the sweating is horrible! i am weaning off of 150mg right now and its horrible,0
ocd behaviors cause addictive tendencies in people more easily what i have found is to change my obsessive thought patterns (and addiction causing thoughts because of this) into something more productive addictions dont have to technically be a bad thing " the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance thing or activity" its not always a substance for me it can be as simple and researching something for animal treats (research has become a huge "positive" addiction for me) or becoming addicted to creating projects to focus on when i am doing badly switch your addictions for something healthy there is a way to do it it just takes a lot of work and youve gotta find something you love enough that is benign or productive enough that it can take its place,1
i am an alcoholic in recovery but still struggle with my food addition,0
hello dawn yes i had an addition to the demon drink but fought hard and won the battle i am like next month 25 years sober i never ever thought id win my fight and struggle but i soul searched and dug a bit deeper and finally won but this was the hardest battle i have ever come face to face with and yes i was straight on to weed for a few years but have since hung up my bong and rolling papers and havent had a bong or joint for 5 years now i believe im so lucky to remain my strength to say noto the above and yes i have issues ocd depression anxiety i know its a hell of a fight as well but i cant afford to let my guard down as i can not and will not be tempted in to the booze and weed again over all im blessed to have found the strength to concor this and remain straight as different feeling yes but i was glad to rid the ol drunken ass me word im a much better person now a days but i have an ice coffee addiction lol but seriously dawn the power of positive thinking works but you got to believe in it and yourself you are the pilot you have the controls please remember this thank you for your strength for being brave and honest in sharing dawn peace to you *,0
i used to smoke but gave that up for gum i gave that up for water when im nervous manic etc i drink more water,0
i could write a long story too but im noti just want to say i hate peopleesp familywho think that because youre diagnosed and are taking meds and seeing a psyche and have seen psychologists that you are fucking ok and not going to drop into depression or skyrocket into a psychotic manic episode(i average 4 of these a year even though im on high doses of meds)i try and hide all my symptoms just to make everyone feel better and not worry about me while silently i die inside slowly with them having no ideaim diagnosed bp1 adhd agoraphobia and social anxietyive found someone special who understands me finally after my marriage of 13years disintegratedat last ive found a reason to look forward,0
thank you for sharing i have been suffering greatly from depression anxiety disorder and trictacatliman or hair pulling disorder ive been suffering since i was about 6years old ive had meds for many year only recently when my insurance company made the switch to generic drugs ive been very unstable as a mother and wife im tring my best at this time but i feel like a failure because i cant get my shit together ive told many ppl in my life im struggling but i feel helpless and alone pleae note i was just recently days ago at my psychologist dr and he says ive done good cuz i know what has brought this on and to keep in touch like really im not doing well im asking for help!!!! im so frustrated,0
one more thing i like to add you just dont all of a sudden say i think i have bipolar or say im bipolar youre born with it its inherited thru one side of family or the other yes some get depressed sometimes your head does go nutty but this is the thing most of us i can guarantee have people in our families that have this disease also bipolar isnt like cancer where it just pops up it may seem like that to us who have this but its definitely inherited thats the the sucky part i wouldnt wish this disease on my worst enemy thanks friends for the support it took me until last year to actually not care about what others think i was embarrassed scared to death to say anything because people have said to me stop being bipolar thats what stopped me from saying anything now idc yes i am bipolar not happy about it but today i can talk about this and not feel embarrassed or ashamed good luck to all and anyone wanting to repost anything i say go for it if i can help just one person come out of their shell ive helped a million to me #livelovelaugh ,0
its good to know that youre now living a productive life despite the unending battle of anxiety there are different levels of anxieties that each of us go through however the case the bottom line is we can conquer anxiety at one degree or another hope this article im sharing with you will be of beneficial to you as it did others take care sir albert ❤️ ,0
ive only been taking wellbutrin for about 6 months but im like a new person however it does not help with anxiety which im still struggling with but it has helped with my depression tremendously i actually lost some weight when i started it and im not as hungry all the time so its helped in a lot of ways its something i would most definitely recommend to anyone,0
wellbutrin didnt help me at all and in fact im positive it increased my anxiety i talked to my pharmacist and they said that its known to cause anxiety and not always the best option for someone with it,1
im with jeanette on this and hate when people think preaching is the answer i am saved for my sins not from pain and struggles he uses our hurts to draw us to a relationship with him but that doesnt mean it is easy; and for those with mental illness well it continues to win on some days and i am tired and dont want to talk with anyone and dont feel like fighting these disorders anymore (i have 3 diagnosis) does that mean i dont have faith? no my faith is what sent me to the hospital because at least i was in a safe place with jesus and couldnt hurt myself and going through that lost everything else - housing family friends job; faith in jesus was all i had now im going to stop having a pity party for myself and get out of this depression thanks for your help even if it took being rebellious jonah turning back to the lord,0

people i know this struggle oh so well i have delt with this bi polar depression all of my 51 years  and it has been one of the biggest challenges of my life i tell you i see it in to ways a curse some of the time and a blessing other times sounds strange yes but true it is a hard journey but i say to each and everyone of you that you all matter you dont drag people down i know its lonely when one is single but we dont have to be lonely there are groups in everyones community who hold meeting on depression etc that really make a difference a difference in their lives as well as your own communication is the key we must break free from being isolated and get out into our safe group of people in the community as they understand us as they wont judge one another for they have issus as well and this wont be the case at all at least please reach out if you are alone we need you to rise up and find your inner strength and go and see if these meetings are for you i believe if you did you would be so proud of yourself to attending as it will be your second wind and an almighty step in the right directionmark my words people do this please you wont regret it these meeting will give you stregnthcourage self esteamand the ability to cope honestly please people take a chance on what im saying as this is the truth i swear and we all need this change from being down when in fact we can be the oppsite and positve and feeling better in our selfs but i was afraid of change and doing something that i wasnt sure of but i tell you all this was the best thing i had ever done in my life i just wished i had of done this a lot soonertake care beautiful people be strong believe that a change will and can come and hope of a brighter day and faith that you can find warmth and inner happiness on a level you are comfortable with thank you all much love and respect to you all kevin pattison xo,0
come on i myself have had this darn bi polar depression anxiety n stress all my 51 years on this planet and if an ol bugger like me can still do my best to kick the demon down and keep it at bay im sure you can be strong and do pretty much the same paige*,1
shy acosta dibaaaa?!?!?!,0
what was your first symptoms im having a thyroid issue i have lost 20lbs in the last few month im 86lbs at 29 years old my count came back to 084 can anyone please tell me whats ahead cause im terrified of going back to talk tomy doctor,0
yes it really depends its either crippling anxiety or muscle tension or in my case restless legsprozac helps but at the end of the day you are what you think if all your gonna think about is anxiety your gonna feel anxious its all in your mind after a while youre mind and body forgets how to be normal and happyso all you know is feeling like shitpatience is everything if you have a mental illness take it one day at a time,0
yes sick feeling inside i sleep uncontrollably alot i could still be unable to stay awake even if i slept all daychest tightening hard to breath thats anxiety attacks though just exhaust,0
yepzero energy after i have these episodescant enjoy the good days fearing the bad ones anymore,0
any good therapist in los angeles any recommendations ima leave mine i was diagnosed with bipolar depression i suffered from a nervous breakdown n im getting attacked the symptoms i do have good and bad days i cant even go gather a haircut like i used to every three weeks i get panic attacks etc,0
fatigue the aforementioned "fog" lethargy restlessness aches & pains and i have spinal stenosis,0
yes my weight especially and all the risk factors that come with carrying too much weight,0
yes when im severely depressed im bed ridden when my severe anxiety is well severe (anxiety attack) i get ill nauseous achy and very unwell foggy head sore and very nauseous,1
yes but most of the time my chronic pain affects my mental health because i get even more depressed because i cant do as much as id like but the more tense i feel from anxiety the more flares i have it goes both ways,0
mine does and my physical health affects my mental health too there are times i cant get out of my mental fog because im in too much pain and by the time my pain is finally eased im too depressed to even do anything anyway because im afraid the pain will come back and my anxiety causes migraines which is what my pain is they are chronic normally but even if im having a good week with them if something triggers my anxiety im done for,0
on "good" days where im not affected by mental health or physical pain i find myself in bed because of overwhelming fatigue im too tired to even enjoy the good days for the most part,0
i think i keep saying the wrong thing and/or over burdening people that dont know me very welli am open and genuine ~ but i think that may be misread i feel pretty awful and guilty if i have made them feel worse! also for some i once knew/knew me as friends and colleagues just seem to think ignoring me was/is the best option which i thought was a bit harsh and cold hearted especially given the fact they know my mental health is in flux and they are mhps!?!pretty sure some other former colleagues would not have acted in the same way if they knewi did not expect to be treated in such a wayi am aware that when i was high i was spewing out stuff all over the placebut surely if they understand anything about bipolar disorder they would not find that a good enough reason to treat me like the shit they must scrape of their shoe ~ major disappointment! i feel guilty/ashamed/ embarrassed for trying to communicate at all i wish i had just remained silent which is my usual coping mechanism when i go to ground but being high totally overrides your self control and inhibition which has obviously upset/annoyed/pissed off and disgusted some folksfeeling so despondent and isolated at this point ,0
does insurance cover this? ive thought about ect and struggle with bipolar disorder,0
i had etc for a few months i can not recommend it i have had severe memory loss (i have no memory of times 10 years before ect) i struggle with memory and cognition today and although i cant prove it i feel comfortable saying my senses have become more sensitive and i am now easily overwhelmed i feel it was the worst thing ive ever done but thats for me many people dont respond the same way i just always feel like people should have informed consent i was never told anything like this could happen but it does i know several others who have had similar experience good luck with whatever you try,0
hey-- i mean i mentioned it once to my parents because i genuinely felt i should never get better but they adamantly refused and told me i would get better i still struggle a lot in terms of mood swings (borderline personality disorder) anxiety and depression but if you make your mental health your top priority in your life you will see a drastic improvement engage in group and individual therapy be compliant with medications and dont be afraid to look for other therapy and psychiatrists sometimes it takes a while to find a good fit and thats okay!,1
dont stress yourself over it think about the other things experience good things you have fallen too deep in you depression get out for someone shall never fall as deep andits the gravities right,0
i went thru this with latuda holy heck it was awful!!! puking headaches vertigo itching paranoia crying spells god help us all,1
its not one of the official withdrawal symptoms but that doesnt mean it isnt related if youre unsure its usually best to consult with your doctor ,1
im not familiar with that certain type of medication; however your body (eg the neck pain and aches) is going to need time to adjust to the transition i wouldnt worry too much unless your pain persists for more than at least a couple of months the only analogy i can think of is a woman goes through 9 months of pregnancy and her body isnt going to bounce back the day of birth nonetheless hope everything works out,0
do you struggle with separation anxiety in relation to your ptsd? i lot of that is coming through to me in your post my sense is the relationship is highly volatile and charged and emotional and ultimately not good for your condition but it would take some intensive counseling for you to work through your feelings and get to a stable footing good luck!,1
i am sorry to hear of your troubles there is so many of us out there but are afraid to speak thank you for your story i am sorry you have to go through this,0
im sorry but the person saying "being in a relationship with a bipolar person is the last thing you need" is terrible advice as someone who is bipolar 1 and ultra rapid cycling i can tell you i am a whole new brand of crazy my husband that has spent 10 years with me and going through this battle with me would say the same my husband is not bipolar but has sever depression and anxiety himself we support each other on my good days he leans on me on my bad days i lean on him we learned about each others issues and how to help each other we did couples therapy to heal some of the wounds i caused before i was diagnosed and properly medicated never give up on someone just because they have a mental illness living with bipolar disorder or any other anxiety depression disorder us hard especially with bipolar because of the stigma you feel ashamed and unaccepted and scared for people to know because you never know how they will react from my own personal experience i was not completely open with my husband or anyone close to me until i was finally properly medicated and thinking clearly i have relationships that got stronger and i have relationships with friends that ended because they never wanted to learn what it really is like not just the movies and if you are a bipolar person out there who feels like you cant be in a relationship because of your mental illness you are wrong it is possible im not going lie and say it is easy shit at one point i was throwing things across the room at my husbands head for no reason but he understood i needed more help then i had i got the right help now i am happy healthy stable and working closely with my psychiatrist to plan starting a family living life to fullest with mental illness is possible,0
what anti anxiety do you take? ive also been having a lot of trouble waking up to alarms lately out of nowhere,1
im really back and forth either i cant sleep at all or i sleep through like 10 alarms im currently not taking anything for sleep but have been on effexor and welbutrin for years,1
no my job is a huge source of stress for me (starting a new one soon) and my husband doesnt believe my diagnosis i dont really have friends either,0
atm whatever i take up as a hobby has to be kid friendly because my lil one will get into it all and that would stress me shes being put into daycare for a couple days a week for me to be able to have mummy time,0
your partner has to be understanding its hard being in a relationship in the first place adding bipolar to that is even harder my marriage has been struggling a lot because of my bipolar disorder my husband tries really hard to understand and be patient but hes only human so we argue and fight but at the end of the day we still say "i love you" and kiss goodnight we know we want to be together so were willing to fight for it,0
if i can only forgive myself! i dont do nothing right i try and try and just get so sick to my stomach because i am ashamed! i dont want to run just dont know what is the best thing for me to doi love my kids just they are living there livesso i dont seem to be liked no matter how much i tryi have so many problems just people dont get iti just want to be happy and loved so my mind goes back and forth what is the best thing to do for me i share because if it can help others maybe i walk and used to work i have so much pain!i have to keep it together i have my dog and place and my son also just dont see him anymore really and two others in another statethen my sister also so when does it end?i tried all meds also nothing,0
i cant i avoid as much as possible lately its been a combo of latuda valium neurontin seroquel (evil drug which i am stopping today after i talk to my psychiatrist at my appointment) and alcohol i do little to nothing i was exercising but got too depressed to do that im going to address all this today with my psychiatrist except the alcohol part hell take away my valium if he knows im drinking the seroquel turns me into a zombie its supposed to be for sleep i sleep for 2 hours then wake up and eat like a pig and just lie there until i fall back asleep been sleeping from 4am to noon every day that needs to change too,0
by distracting yourself with tv books and video games until youve trained yourself to act without allowing your head to intervene then all you have to worry about if night cause thats when everything that youve blocked up comes flooding in,0
when i was younger i remember my little sister had toileting issues until she was 8 years old doctors found a minor issue with her bladder it wasnt serious but eventually it happened for her maybe you could take your little one to see a doctor about her issue with toileting? this could really help yours & hers situation & relieve some of the stress on yourself id also recommend seeking government assistance/support to help with your financial situation until your back on your feet & id defer university for a semester its not easy to go through what your going through although there are steps you can take to ease or even rectify your greatest stresses lastly if your psych isnt meeting your needs try explaining this to him/her otherwise search for one you feel would be more suitable for you,1
hugs hugsyour not a failure your dealing with somethings right now and i have experienced this many timesall my doctor does is change or increase my meds as welli to have no friends i also have massive anxiety which causes me to avoid peoplepm me if youd like i will listen,1
first youve got to tell this to family your child needs to be safe so you can get a break and sort yourself out parents? siblings? fathers parents? who can take the pressure off you for a week or so? if youre failing classes you need to look at your options talk to your teachers and tell them you have a medical situation causing this temporary slump in grades but what are your options? you may need time off due to the break up because you wont be able to concentrate or sleep well and free counseling is something you probably need to heal try and stay on the meds and let them settle new meds take about six weeks to fully work good luck! dont forget to find a bipolar support group in your area,1
my wife left me because of my bipolar disorder recently as well no children involved thankfully i dont know what im going to do either i work 1 day a week washing dishes at my familys restaurant i am a college educated professional and just cant work in the corporate environment anymore i have some some savings that im living on but it wont last forever im going through a bankruptcy and divorce at the same time too im just stuck i sleep and watch tv mostly try to exercise but have been failing miserably at that lately i drink too which isnt good just know that other people are struggling too i keep telling myself that things are going to work out but nothing changes,0
stop worrying about what you dont have an be thankful for what you do have an when you had that child it became about him not you get in a good church go to class online they have grants,0
first & foremost dont take the stress of work home with you use the time youre not working doing something you enjoy and relaxing a bit if there is any way to go to local groups that might be helpful too or even religious services if you are a religious person also although i know it can be hard to get up early if you have a lot of fatigue but it really helps to have extra time to get your day started and make your morning routine something that pumps you up and motivates you for the day these are things that help me at least and i hope it can help you too :),1
well first you should congralate yourself that you can hold dowm a job and a highly paid one apart from allowing time for appointments giving you chance to reduce your hours or change duties even for temporary period refer you to occupational health for support ensure you dobt experience discrimination bullying etc at work not sure what else you think they should do i dont know where you are from or what sector you work in sometimes you need to step back and if that means changing jobs or taking less stressful lower paid job for your health then you zhpujd consider it i have had to except that although i have a reasonable job with a reasonable salary im never going to be able to do a more senior job due to my mh and i have really struggled to accept that and not feel and if i am a failure but i know for me thats how it is,0
my experience too work wasnt understanding and on top of it i had coworkers threaten me as well as supervisor ended up walking out and getting baker acted now trying for disability difficult surviving let alone dealing with the disorder prayers for all,0
is a stress leave an option? maybe you just need a little break to recharge your battery?,1
all i can offer is my thirst knowing what bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are about i have the depression and hypo mania of bipolar disorder ii plus which i have chronically lived with the illnesses are simultaneously genetic disorders and environmentally influenced diseases hence psychiatric conditions being referred as either disorders or illnesses to the exclusion of the nature nurture controversy as stress and trauma impact on one with the genetic disorder of bp (environmeninfluence),1
i suggest looking up mindfulness its a technique therapists use for anxiety and im sure it would be helpful in your situation when i start to feel uneasy about s situation i pull out some play doh and get my mindfulness head on i focus on the play doh and smell it feel it squish it rub it against my cheek etc its about focusing on something else ive even done it with a tissue a really simple version but a bit more invasive is colouring again a way to really empty the mind and focus on 1 specific thing there are lots of resources on the net and even apps for your phone all the best,0
i found it helped me greatly when i had post natal depression it calmed me down more than anything nd anxiety was all pretty much gonei was on 50mg ns eventually it pooped out cause i didnt want to up it nd got pretty depressed it didnt boost me up anymore bur that was after 2 yrs,1
i havent had a manic episode in a while but have been very depressed ive been isolating sleeping eating poorly and drinking a lot of beer im lonely but dont want to be around anyone one of my meds is seroquel which i hate i take it for sleep and its unpredictable most nights ill sleep for two hours wake up eat all kinds of junk and then go lie down for hours waiting for sleep to come its horrible but it beats a manic episode im in the doctors office right now waiting to see him,1
do you keep a mood journal? it can be a great way of keeping track and you may be able to avoid those bad situations you mentioned i know a great thing to stop me from spending all my money into put my credit card into a bucket of water into the freezer you have to wait for the ice to melt before you can use it and by that time the urge may have stopped i hope you can weather this episode try and sleep if you can take care,1
self-awareness is extremely important when fighting mental illness you can get through this cycle and you know it ride it out and think twice at every turn avoid regret you can do it!,0
no one will ever understand what we go through every day then we have mania when we feel we can accomplish anything then bang the depression sets in its soul destroying all i ask for is to be normal even with medication i still struggle,0
i have high anxiety driving just local i get all worked up to just drive to work which is maybe a mile or a little over i hate to drive i even get worked up being a passenger at times if i have to go out of town it is more common then people want to admit i hate driving and it is so hard for people understand how my anxiety gets there are some crazy drivers out there which does not help,0
60mg all the way down to none i had constant anxiety,1
my doctors told me that ssris are bad for my hypomania im on latuda(helps) valium and neurontin for panic/anxiety (helps) and seroquel (hate it) for sleep the seroquel puts me to sleep for maybe 2 hours and then i wake up and eat everything in sight,1
its horrible i want to try and get ambien when i see him on thursday,0
at 30mg i had a lot of irritability and agitation my daughter didnt even want to talk to me my doctor put me on 60 mg and most of it went away,0
agitation anxiety mania that drug did threw me from depression straight into high level hypomania and mixed states im fairly certain that was the drug that landed me in the hospital,1
that sucks cause same thing happened to me was on the 30mg for less than 2 weeks ans i couldnt even tolerate itrage agitation and worse anxiety:( wasnt sure whether the dose was too small or just it plain didnt agree for mein the past pristiq and effexor worked ok so thought this one would too,1
ive been on 30mg and now on 60mg occasionally get anxiety but nothing severe unless i havent taken my meds cymbalta is to treat both depression and anxiety from what my gp advised when i was first put on it though,1
i think much of of this fear and loathing is based on the horrible stigma of mental illness i hate being bipolar also but we have a sickness that people professionals included and science know so little about so we are poisoned with medication to survive in an unwelcoming world like lepers,0
we all have our struggles and stories some like to share and some find it to hard to try and begin to but we must be strong and keep the faith and hope for guidance to get through we can and will be determined to continue people * love and blessings to all*,0
not sure what were all suffering here but ive heard it said those with anxiety are pretty empathic so can help others but o always find helping myself is a whole different ball game,1
do it no matter how scary it seems youll be glad you did,0
talking to someone is the biggest best first step - think of it as start a journey towards a happier life see it as a bright light think of it as the best wish you could ever wish for get someone to take you/escort you of getting out of the house or the journey is the thing you fear please go / find the help and support to go talk to someone on the phone while you get ready and go to encourage and support you over the phone if no one can help you go in person,0
i recently decided to go back to therapy the first one did not "fit" but i love the second one! so remember you choose who you see and not the other way around if it does not feel right keep looking for the right one i spent way too much money on the wrong ones in the past who did not listen to me or what i wanted or needed but they really can help with your anxiety! good luck!!,0
i go to a therapist once a month and i still have a panic attack the day before and right up until i am sitting in his office,0
i have anxiety issues as well i used to have panic attacks thinking about going and not sleep the night before now i look forward to my friday morning sessions my sister in law tried counseling and didnt feel comfortable with her counselor find someone different dont just stop going sometimes its trial and error to find the right fit,1
i had panic attacks on my first few sessions but now im starting to feel comfortable so its okay remember that theyre professionals in that field and probably have seen a lot of people having panic attack so they wont see you as someone weird or crazy saying this because i think panic attack gets worse when you control it because you dont want other people to see it so tell yourself its okay to have panic attack afterall thats the reason why you need professional help,0
go do something to occupy your mind and stop thinking about it so much? its only a thought let it go!! you look back in a week and i think how silly for you to think that this could cause you anxiety or stress it will pass!,0
i had the exact same anxiety and i was so happy once i made the decision to go see someone youll be happy you did also get a journal or at least a piece of paper and try to write down whatever youre feeling/going through and what aspects of your life are factors in your mental health trying to remember everything when you know you only have 30 minutes or an hour or whatever sometimes makes me feel pressured,0
i worry myself almost to death when its time for my 3 mo appointment then i feel so relieved when it is overi have no idea why this happensbut every 3 mo i put myself through a world of worry hang in there i know how you feelyou will be so relieved when its over,0
just remember they are here to help and they are not judging you it isnt a test  they usually help you to learn how to manage it and it can be very useful opening up to a stranger i had cbt and for me it did wonders !! :) hope all goes well x i suggest taking some rescue remedy (can be found in most pharmacies) it really helps me settle my anxiety hope this helps x,1
panic attacks sucki am so much better nowi was really bad at one pointseveral trips to ercouldnt drive couldnt go eat outdid counseling and it helpit taught me how to control themtook clonzapam since 2001now i am off and on xanax as neededstill have my klons thoughdo the counselinggood luckso glad i am getting over that crapbut the fear is still there,0
ive just had to have my esa assessment hated every minute of being in there ive also got to go to counciling aswell as a psychological assessment so in the same boat and seriously worried about it all have i done enough in the assessment etc i hope that i goes ok for both of us,0
dont worry i also have anxiety and panic attacks my counsellor was amazing they let you go at your pace he/she will be there every step of the way for you tell them how youre feeling at that precise moment they wont make you do anything youre uncomfortable with or stressed out with after all theyre there to help and guide you take care and good luck x,0
i found counselling a god send and a relief just keep telling yourself this is a good thing if you do have a panic attack they will be able to talk you through it which will be helpful for the next panic attack,0
always knew that anxiety and depression frequently hang out together,1
i started low on quitipine now i am on 600 at night this last mounth i have become so ill nearly was addmited to helston hospital to day i have a med review as i still needing help i got to say my doctor and my care worker helping me best as they can never lie to them be as onisted as you can and to all you other being horrible to this person who needs help not you stupid fucking judgment,1
i understand exactly how you feel i would sit and listen to my dr drone on and on about medicine i was taking and the dosage i have been thru a gambit of drugs with no success finally i got angry and told the dr i was not a test dummy to give me something that worked i just wanted to feel better i believe i scared the dr because i yelled so loud i told him i needed him to listen to me because it was my turn to talk my appointment ran over but he got my message im not cured but im doing one hell of a lot better i moved into an apartment 2 years ago and still have unpacked boxes in the kitchen i used to be a bundle of energy now nothing seems to rattle me because i know ill get to it eventually,0
sharon who is suffering from his i was diagnosed with anxiety that was part off why i needed to talk to someone i love now since i am finally cancer free i dont get quite so anxious any more it feels terrible to suffer from that ,0
and you shouldnt be shamed for it!,0
my driving phobia started in july 2006 on a trip between jackson ms and memphis ideas: either claustrophobia or agoraphobia or both dr had me try rolling my windows down while driving the further away the destination or the longer the trip or the more stops i have to make intensifies the anxiety over the past three years it has gotten to where i cant leave the house without having some sort of anxiety or a full-blown panic attack i have reached my destination before and had to leave because everything started going black and i started hyperventilating and felt like i would pass out,1
i cant go too far from home or i get panic/anxiety bad i have to take valium & neurontin to go anywhere in a car,1
i suffer from the same i try to talk myself out of it but it is very difficult i hope you find a way to tackle this i know how terrifying it is,0
agoraphobia boerline personality disorder bi-polar pts disorder and degenerative disc disorder are what my everyday is filled with disability at the age of 32 child support and total of $88 for food no phone to make or receive calls no car to make it to dr appointments for phycologist gastrologist neurologist counseling and family pa the only thing that gets me through every moment of the day is the positivity i try to surround myself with it is very easy for negative self pity to sneak into our minds as soon as you realize youre thinking or being negative smack it down with something anything positive make small goals cant take a shower cause its too scary wash your face or even just wash your hands chin up buttercup!,0
im sorry i dont have a solution for you but you arent sponging and you shouldve feel ashamed to ask for assistance or help you need it in order to get better im in the same situation and its so hard some days i wish there was more help for those with mental illness worrying about having a roof over your head or stress doesnt help when you are ill dont lose hope when things get bad i hope things get better,0
you might want to ask your doctor about being bipolar you sound manic with anxiety to me im not a doctor but i have bipolar do you have reckless behavior the shopping thing we know do you have mood swings being low and depressed not wanting to get out of bed do you go into an extreme high on life like you can do anything? these are all traits of bipolar i have bipolar 2 with depression anxiety ptsd from abuse as a child please make an urgent appt with your doctor also keep a thought journal account for your spending any racing thoughts sleepless nights and eating take to your dr there is a questionnaire on bipolar disorder they can give you,1
unfortunately i find myself feeling the same way being able to not only find something i like and being able to actually buy it! i have something i have never admitted to but i found myself shoplifting i have since dec stopped that ilegal habbit! still struggle everyday with doing absolutely everything i can to give myself at least one positive thing or thought a day! good luck to you!,0
it sounds like your agitating and highly anxious which is understandable hang in there the clothes wont hide how you feel,0
this is what i started to do before my manic depressive episode i am not trying to diagnose you but if you have a regular psychiatrist please talk to them i had chronic depression for five years and as the stress built up while preparing to teach a class of my peers i finally had to be "committed" for two weeks for my own safety your upcoming trial is definitely more of an ordeal then mine i wish you well and pray you receive the help and justice required,1
i do the same with art supplies i have so many sketch books pencils markersyou name it i have it it makes me feel so good to get these thing but then i crash later when i have trouble using them or cant find inspiration right away youre not alone i almost had a panic attack at the grocery store tonight just because i know my money was really limited but i needed food i was lucky my mom was with me because when i got in the car she distracted me with chit chat and i calmed down anxiety is a booger but you are hear and you are alive and youre sharing with us good luck with the trial will be thinking about you,0
its mania get some rest get a hobby and avoid stress no drinking,1
try mindfulness there are plenty of resources on the net and i think there are even apps you can download that can help to focus your thoughts and attention onto things that are more helpful id also speak to your dr keep a mood journal that you can take to your appointment as it can help with diagnosis and is there so you dont have to stress about remembering everything,1
its really normal to avoid thinking about big difficult upcoming things with compulsive behaviours like spending,0
i used to do this you are trying to find things that make you happy or keep your focus away from at the stress and overwhelming emotions getting yourself pretty things gives to something to do and you feel good doing it at first the main thing is to try and find other ways to support maybe working out going for a walk with friends colouring etc something you like doing that might not cost money but will distract you,0
this is wise advice for this individual when im distressed i start spending money so what youre telling this person to do make sense find alternatives that give pleasure without spending money in the end i started to go swimming i find this a great help for calming me down that may help you,1
it sounds like you need to work with a therapist to address your anxieties medication will not solve feelings of insecurity and you may be thinking it will your symptoms dont sound like bipolar but have your dr do a full assessment bipolar depression and regular depression both suck and can last a long time if not managed effectively,1
i understand i want to be normal so bad tired of the pills that dont work well tired of the being exhausted from the struggle of keeping my shit together see a dr if they help even a little its better than what you have now  good luck,0
you have an illness that is trying to run your life and make you miserable are you on meds now? in therapy? if not please try to get help depression doesnt need a reason,1
you mite try lexapro for depression alprazolam for anxiety and seroquel at a low dose for the bipolari have panic attacks all my life ( its inherited ) but there is nothing better than having a liltalk with jesus if ur a christian or whom ever ur higher power is i choose god,1
lithium for depression/ bipolar disorder works well  i was on lithium from age 12 - 17  last year i changed to lamotrigine for depression/ bipolar disorder  quetiapine for sleeping & lorazepam for anxiety  these 3 work wonders !!,1
i agree lithium has been my wonder drug research it i am on the lowest dose it sounds scary but educate yourself on it and youll see it differently i feel like it has given me peace in my life when i had never really known what that felt like,0
i too am bipolar but i have bipolar where the manic episodes are very similar to yours boundless energy and no patience have to make sure house is organized and clean etc there are a lot of meds out there but the one that helped me most was the mood stabilizer called lamotrigine it evens out your moods i also take busparone to help with the anxiety and it really helps me be sure to see a psych specialist to get a proper diagnosis if you cant afford one check for free or low cost mental health clinics in your area or call 211 in any state it is a help line to help you find services in your area,1
i hate all bugs but im terrified of moths,0
ive been trying to deal with my cricket phobia for years,0
im not alone in my ant phobia???,0
yes!!! the biggest fear of course being spider but i hate/ fear all sorts of bugs especially since i am allergic,0
maggots and grubs the way they move i have helminthephobia which is the fear of being eaten alive by worms,0
cricketsaghhhhit gags me to even say the wordand butterfly feetim good to look at a butterfly from a distance but if it lands on me i go full panic attack,0
yes especially ones that live in or on my body eyelash bugsi cant think about them fleas ticks bedbugs i cant think about it or i go into phobia,0
the ones i cant see i fear more than the ones i can see! or wasps,0
hi this post was from me just an update my gp referred me to mind mental health service i had my telephone assessment today and after forty minutes on the phone the woman told me they couldnt help as soon as i told her ive noticed ive had symptoms of mania she said she will have to consult her supervisor because they only provide therapy not diagnosis (i get that) but she thinks im not fit for their services because she doesnt think i have just got depression what happens now? im back in square one just feel upset because im getting sent back and forth ,0
sounds like you could hav bipolar 2 and going through hypomania episode but i wouldnt consider what you describe as being full blown mania as you are very aware of what you are doing and during a mania persons lack of insight into their behaviour and believes it is appropriate within given situation when it is very obvious that is isnt to other people mania doesnt equal feeling good happy or on top of the world which many people are saying here - you can feel like that but characteristics are lowering of inhibitions impulsive reckless and sometimes dangerous behaviour or placing yourself in dangerous situations feeling invincible really uncontrollably excitable energetic or agitated irritability racing thoughts anxiety thinking you know things other people dont paranoid beliefs psychotic symptoms include receiving special messages believing you are special powers etc having said that if you go through cycling moods every few weeks you should see dr as this more like bp2,0
you are in a manic phase of your depression and everything you have said made sense dont worry the doctor will fix it and when you do crash it will not be good i wish you well you will be fine i know your brain is racing as the previous lady said go to the er its very important you get help quickly,1
thanks lisa i was beginning to panic as i thought this was hypomania too my diagnosis is bp2 i was starting to think i was bp1,0
well could be either im not claiming to be a dr i was first diagnosed bipolar i last year now im being told more likely bipolar ii bcuz the mania isnt as severe and theyre more depressive spells i was however hospitalized once 2 yrs ago when i was just very upset but like ive never felt invincible or done anything more than depicted above but could be either for me - or this person to clarify either way i empathize,0
it all seems overwhelming there is medicine that helps and its a long journey getting it dialed in even then youll still have failures its about a willingness to get up more times than you fall down everything else is just background noise i drive on dirt roads whenever i can and play my music loud! truth thats how i found my inner-peace just gotta find your dirt road ,1
i thought a bipolar was a bear thats confused sexually and likes to play on both teams hahaha,0
thats so true but most people we are not sick shame on them,0
thats me every day no matter what i do it is never good enough i try and i fail at least my daughters can see that i am making the effort to change so i am making a difference to somebody i just have to see it in myself make more positive changes do the right thing get right with god be positive and dont be afraid to smile,0
anyone experience relationship guilt? you just cant be happy and vibrant like your partner and know she needs/ deserves someone like thathow do you deal with thisknowing she was happier before she met you?,0
omg so true my ex would say things about my anxiety & depression & would put me in horrible positions around his friends he used to get drunk be sarcastic & upset me wen i got upset he would blame me cos we had a disagreement didnt help he was a narsasist,0
you blame me for my sickness and you create intense stress to keep me sicker,1
the high sex drive is a side effect of some medications it happened to me when i was prescribed seroquel i also had obsessive thoughts i had enough after a few months and asked my shrink to change my meds the meds im being weened off of now effexor made me lose interest in everything now im another step closer to being completely off the friggin things my interests are coming back thoughts are clearer but i do have periods of deep depression and for some reason i started cutting myself when the sadness is at its worst ive been also diagnosed with major depression something like 12 years ago but something else was wrong,1
never rule out youre psychic abilities too they often represent as anxiety and occur in people who are empaths and subsequently depressed deep-feelers,0
i have experienced the same symptoms as well i had a breakdown last year i was in the hospital for 10 days they put me on seroquel i was diagnosed with ptsd  bipolar major depression and panic disorder i dont know how i would be without it im not gonna sit here and say how bad it is  because for now i am as "normal" as im going to be you are not alone,0
you know i experienced voices calling my name also i would turn off everything in the house and then go around to the computer stereo tv etc and listen for sound nothing but i still heard the voices i also had symptoms very similar to yours the sexuality spending racing thoughts all unable to control but i do not think i was aware that they represented something wrong with me at the time that does not mean you do not need care i have severe bipolar with depression and anxiety and take a lot of meds including seroquel i was hospitalized 4x one a legal hold ive been on the seroquel for 2+ years and have begun to gain weight back after a huge weight loss when not accurately diagnosed with bipolar i do not seem to be as sedated as other people mentionbut i am very unproductive in day to day activities i take many medications zolpidem temazepam valium zoloft tegretol hydroxyzine + more and yes meds are expensive and have many side effects i agree that major depression is probably one part of your diagnosis and you are experiencing symptoms that also still need to be addressed it is a daily challenge and a continual process never ending bs that is your life please keep going,1
everything you described is systems that we all experience impulsive decisions that arent thought through the biggest issue is when we are going through an episode we dont recognize it serquol has helped me recognize when i am having an episode i have been on it for over 15 years it takes about three months for the medication to really get into your system and not experience the side effects i also have to take sleep aids due to obsessive thoughts nightmares and,1
i take seroquel also 400 mg at night and 200 mg as needed during the day for anxiety and diazepam as needed for depression and anxiety i am not happy,1
i used to hear voices but it was my own i have bpd major depression social and generalised anxiety but you could have anything between bpd bipolar and schizophrenia,1
when bipolar goes from paranoid state into psychosis the usual hallucinations type stuff rolls i doubt your diagnosis is going to change as youre presenting with bipolar 1 manic traits and instability of mood keep working with your doctors things will settle down soon enough,1
the seroquel gave me severe anxiety and odd dreams been off of it for 4 years and still suffer with anxiety and depression,1
i am diagnosed bipolar major depressive disorder general anxiety disorder did and was started on 200mg seroquel i only took it for about 3mo because it caused weight gain and made me sleep constantly! its taken about a year to find my right combo of medication but now i am doing well on them in addition to therapy current meds: 400mg lamictal 150mg wellbutrin 30mg buspar 1mg klonopin and 10mg ambien,1
so true derek seroquel is a two-faced monster blissful oblivion and a foggy zombie-like "life" i have to quit it too but the other neuroleptica stuff have disturbing effects too its a drag :/,0
the major depression is probably just one part of the diagnosis i am bipolar with social phobia major depression general anxiety disorder and stress it is a complete pain in the ass!!!,1
ok i have voices in my head at night time about my past thinking of my mum and dad and friends its like im there but im not and when i awake its gone its only when im asleep and sometimes it stops me from sleeping not sure what you call it but it can be disturbing,0
when people say they hear voices it is actual voices they hear but you can have intrusive thoughts which when you have them seem to be outwith your control and can be very very strong and loud but that is not same ad actually hearing voices although can be just as distressing especially when thoughts are very ngayive or disturbing,0
i have homicidal ideations when i get extremely agitated or irritated i hear voices when im depressed,0
keep a mood journal this can help a psychiatrist get a correct diagnosis seroquel is used in some people with bipolar it didnt work for me i was diagnosed with bipolar i and i had the extreme moods and voices either telling me i was better than everyone else or that i should kill myself because i am so pathetic and useless scary stuff it took me 18 mths to find a combo of meds that worked with the least amount of side effects as well as meds i saw a psychologist who did cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness this gave me tools to help myself in dealing with bipolar and predicting when an extreme would occur you can do a bit of research while youre waiting to see your psychiatrist only a psychiatrist should diagnose mental illness all the best,1
lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine but please i cant stress enough the way a person reacts to a medication differs from person to person it is a very personal thing all medications have side effects i have just found a combo with side effects i can cope with,0
schizophrenia displays symptoms of depression as well as psychosis (audio hallucination is common) and may explain the obsessive thoughts and impulsive behaviour; mdd has a psychotic symptoms allowance but you dont tend to come across psychotic mdd patients that hallucinate; bipolar (type 2 i believe) would explain the depression impulsive symptoms and the psychosis;,1
hearing voices are common symptoms of major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety once you feel better you wont hear it anymore but your other symptoms do sound like symptoms of bi polar disorder,1
i never said anyone was a liar it was entirely read in some therapists have a view that their experience is all the knowledge needed to work with others take a theoretical approach while its true that someone with mdd doesnt commonly present with audio hallucinations it doesnt mean that a specialist who works more within experience than theory wouldnt contradict that statement and say that people with mdd do get audio hallucinations because in his experience he has treated many mdd patients with psychosis so which one is correct? neither because both are right in their own scope theory is usually more about general psychology so this is generally true; where as people learning from experience have their eye on a specific population and has specific intrests meaning they dont worry about general information but information specific to his clients,0
agreed debbie and tarnya i have off the chart severe anxiety panic disorder severe depression type 2 bipolar borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder my bro and i live with one another and when im just about to drift off i swear to god i hear my brother saying "aye candy candy??" but the thing is hes in his room snoring after my mum passed i would hear her too calling my name now i hear bro im not nuts am i???,0
im training in the medical field and have been with the same paychologist for years and he showed me the dsm-iv-tr and he explained how they diagnose he also told me that the psychosis that presents in depression is often delusions (which i was having at that point hence him explaining this all to me) he also explained schizophrenia bpd bipolar and anxiety (also had severe anxiety at the time; bpd and schizophrenia because one of my relatives has those and bipolar because it was suspected i may be bipolar) my gp also explained them all to as to how they present and a basic medical run down of them so i dont know but i have a feeling that they dont present with audio hallucination; the other issue is mdd even psychotic mdd usually is caused by a serotonin based issue whereas when ssris are given to healthy people they dont tend to cause psychosis where as schizophrenia and bipolar both of which have depressive symptoms (which are usually treated with ssris) as well as psychois (treated with dopamine antagonists called antipsychotics),1
ask your psychiatrist hearing voices alone is common with mdd and severe anxiety,0
i didnt see any symptoms at all of schizophrenia hearing voices in common with major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety,1
i didnt see any symptoms at all of schizophrenia hearing voices in common with major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety,1
been battling since first breakdown in 1966 it doesntt get any easierhorrible!,0
i lost a great friend last month he got drunk and hung himself he had little kids just a waste and we are all left to pick up the pieces and feel sad down guilty and just hopeless to do anything the dead are gone the living are left to hurt,0
it is so very easy for ex partners to say one is lazy etc but let them be in your shoes for a couple of days and see what they say then the buggers how dare they i have had bi polar depression anxiety and stress all my life im now 51 its such a diffucult journey and for thoes to say one is lazy etc they wouldnt even begin to understand where you are comming from cause they have never had to deal with any issuses as we do be strong my brave people take care and love to you all,0
yes i fight every minute against my mental illness since 1990 and it is so hard im so tired and where i work (and this too is hard to go there every day) few of my co-workers know my battle and im so fed up to live with fears minute after minute i have medications to take but it doesnt cure,0
try take 1 step at a time your not worthless your worth every breath you take i suffer the same but every now and then i organise to go out with a girlfriend the anxiety is soo bad leading up to the nite but iv worked out once im out its ok & then i dont want to go bak home 1 step at a time,1
i feel lazy but it is a war with various sized battles every day my wife supports me and the kids i havent been able to hold a jobever the longest i held a job was 6 months that was as a cashier at chevron but we both hated that and so i quit that one i actually did find a nice job that paid less than minimum wagebut they closed up shop and moved on ive tried various pills and such and ive tried talking to people but ive not found anything that works and im afraid to try anything else since the side effects have been (so far) permanent and not fun and because the people that i talk to that are supposed to help dont care im just a paycheck to the ones ive met so far i dunno what to do but im draining my wife of energy and i dont want to do that she has worked so hard for the last ten years to support me she would be much better off financially without me she assures me she wouldnt be as happy without me but i think she could do much better and be much happier and all i feel like i do anymore is whine about my issues,0
my husband understands most of the timebut he has severe heart problems and tries to make up the differencemakes me feel guilty and ashamed of feeling like shit all the timeday 4 no showerno energy:(,0
may be time to move on not every partner can deal with it in a healthy manner had plenty of exes treat me like dirt thought i would make it up for attention etc found a guy who is patient and loving with me even when i snap or have an anxiety attack it takes a strong person,1
i had the same issue with my boyfriend - i had written in my journal about what one day was like for me - from the time i woke up to the time i fell asleep (if i even fell asleep) i wrote a stream of thought about what goes through my mind and went into detail about what gives me anxiety and my daily interactions where i have to act like im susie sunshine because thats what people expect of me so by the time i get home i am too exhausted to even think yet my mind still goes and i wrote another stream of thought - when i wrote it i had no intention of sharing it with anybody - but i got to a point where i was tired of him resenting me and telling me i was just making excuses - so i read it to him and something finally clicked in him - sometimes he will get angry - and i dont blame him for that - being with someone with a mental illness is frustrating - but his demeanor has changed a tremendous amount - i also told him what i felt he could do to help me in those situations he is not perfect but things have improved so much,0
dussel panic inthismoment lianda lindov,0
well have i learnt that you think some people care then they turn their back on you even though they know you are struggling one minute they are asking how you are then suddenly nothing i will never know how some people can be so cruel,0
being distrustful of everyone isnt a good way to do it either i give everyone one chance if they prove i made a bad choice i move on but so far thats been rare <3 love and live dont hide and fear please <3,0
get out of the house too and get in that sunshine even if you dont want to contact them first if you have to even if you dont want to action it helps our worries lonlieness dread feelings of inadequacies  and dislike of self go away i just started taking lithium a month ago im laughing again stay strong and like nike just do it! lol,0
its ok ive been there before i doubted my friends and their love for me it turns out they didnt know what to say and were trying to give me space i had a talk with them that if they dont hear from me one day that is ok two days and they all contact me that way im reassured that they care how long have you been on your meds? it takes 2-3 weeks for them to be fully effective i would still touch base with your doctor to make sure your medication is ok,0
how amazing are you full credit to you you have done so well people who struggle with this illness will gain hope from this post i myself have a relatively normal life but im quite heavily medicated ive been in my job for 18 years and yes ive had small glitches but all in all ive done very well well done to you to be able to deal with your illness without meds long may it continue ,0
fortunately for me i dont usually have those i get obsessive thoughts sometimes but again all things i try to manage i have a good relationship with my dr and i communicate with him if i start to feel off everyones symptoms manifest differently,0
i am 18 weeks pregnant no meds  great support system and great drs!!!! i def see the difference of no medication and i really cant wait to go back on it i am functioning fine but the struggle is real and with medication i had no fight anymore !! i was on the right amount the right ones !!!,1
i have bpd and i find the best thing that has helped me is quetipine when distressed i go up and down all the time also talking and counselling,1
i would see a psychiatrist for an actual diagnosis as an intake person isnt qualified to do so for treatment of bpd the best form is dbt (dialectical behavior therapy) if you actually do have bpd your psychiatrist can get you in touch with the appropriate therapist to treat you bpd and bipolar disorder are easily confused with one another so a qualified professional diagnosis is best,1
mental illnesses are not character flaws theyre not proof that we are screw-ups lazy or stupid they dont make us bad mothers sisters or daughters they dont give you an excuse to be angry at us to disrespect us or to dismiss our opinions we are worthy of respect and acceptance which too often we only receive from each other if youre a hater shame on you it takes more effort to be shitty to me than it would to have an honest reciprocal relationship with me my daughters and my mother (from whom they learned their callous selfish behavior) are missing out thank goodness for my dear departed grandparents who helped me hang on to my belief in myself and my few cherished friends ,0
please see your doctor for meds alternatives that help with the weight issue more important is to not make a plan cbt from a clinical psychologist is great they help you talk frankly about how you feel and what behavior changes you can do its helped me most important self care and talking about it seek help asap god bless and remember youre not alone we are all here and understand your struggle ❤️ ,0
yes i feel very similar i was diagnosed with mixed anxiety depressive disorder as is my 18 yr old daughter ive just finished treatment for my 2nd breast cancer in 12yrs i take amitriptyline & epilum i feel i am a burden to everyone & have suicidal thoughts,1
yes my history is very similar to yours i was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for 26 years then new symptoms appeared and i became very angry and destructive at times other times i was manic high on life an unstoppable force i gained a lot of weight while depressed then i spiraled out of control with insomnia unfocused suicide attempt lost over a 100# and did not recognize myself i was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar severe i still battle with suicide ideation often i think no one wants or loves me i spend time alone with my own thoughts praying and writing i do know if i committed suicide my children would definitely be hurt by my loss they keep me going i do not want to bring any destructive forces into their livesmy love is unconditional as for everyone else who offers nothing but judgement and negativity block all they tell you you are sick and people like your mom are only making your situation worse and more stressful you are worth it loved and needed always,0
but what if its just paranoia?,0
go to er and they have to help you tell them you are struggling and you need emergency medical that works in california but see what they can do where you live also most psychiatrist have free samples ask your doctor for help good luck,1
im facing that now still employed but fear losing job soon,0
call your states assistance line you can call 211 from any state to be connected to various social services they will hook you up with someone in your area that helps get meds for free or at a very low cost calling a free medical clinic is also a great idea i did both and was able to get all 4 of my meds free going cold turkey can set off episodes and make it difficult to deal with everyday life and the people in it call those places and tell them when you will run out of your meds so they can help you as soon as possible you can do this! there are a lot of ways to tackle this dont stress outit will work out if you find someone to help! ive had to do that twice and it worked out both times go online and look for a mental health clinic that serves the poor and those without insurance ive been going to one for over a year and they do free meds counseling and appointments with psychiatrists thats your first best option you can do this!,1
yeah cant get to sleep i worry too much about what will happen tomarrow,1
i am up most nights as i have anxiety about going to bed i hate lying there and not being able to sleep so instead i stay up until i am so tired i am almost sick and then get some sleep most days i dont to bed till 5am or later sometimes it isnt till the afternoon like tonight i havent gone to bed yet and it is after 7am,1
i have pretty bad anxiety attacks at night sometimes sometimes thats how i know im manic,0
its 3am now im awake everyone else is asleep ive just had a shot of vodka to calm down the panic,0
yeah the anxiety is alot worse for me due to the lack of sleep anger from not being able to sleep and all the other shit in that day thats just added to it,1
my worst anxiety is at night it seems my mind races 1000mph and i cant make it stop i have tried every sleep med sedation drugs routines music and meditation i am sure this doesnt help much but i wanted to let u know you are not alone,1
hi  just coming out of about of anxiety and depression but had a dip yesterday and today so your enquiry had very recent meaning for me what i found helped or was at least distracting was to listen to mediations on youtube for insomnia and anxiety to at least distract myself from ruminating rumination is when you have the same things going round and round in your head they may be things you have to do should do or things you cannot do anything about but concern you sometimes it can be the littlest things or what might appear to be the silliest things go to and look under meditations see lina grace at ,1
all night! and all day! 24/7! its miserable fml,0
i have horrible insomnia go days without sleep,0
i have bi polar anxiety and panic attacks i have bad bad highs and lows it may not seem possible but something ive come to realise is that this is the last time i read the comments because they make my lows even worse,1
i also have bipolar anxiety and panic attacks i think reading the messages triggers you because its a constant talk of the disorders,1
sometimes iwake up twitching / shaking from anxiety its very difficult because work a full time job,1
yes i do and im taking sleeping pills and anxiety meds and its not working im so frustrated,1
not anxiety but i cannot sleep more than 45 minutes without a pill otherwise my body treats it as a power nap,1
yes i use seroquil its works for anxiety its not a sleep drug but a side affect is drowsiness i love it,1
insomnia is common for those of us with mental illnesses the anxiety well any time you dont have something distracting you the panic sets in talk to your doctor about lack off sleep can make your illness worse,1
if their is no single reason behind his depression then it could be his life style he needs constant attention from family members until he has confidence to to shake off the deppresion find out what sport or interest he has and take it from there  good luck ,1
my son is 16 and hasnt gone to school in a month he is also struggling with depression and anxiety it took me a couple of years to get him to agree to go to counseling i made him an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist he went to his first counseling session on wednesday and he said he thinks it is going to help him and he really likes his therapist i think when they finally understand that therapy isnt a bad thing that is when the good happens just continue to be supportive and dont nag i hope he comes around and decides to do therapy it honestly helps more than anything good luck,0
that is so sad im sorry my depression came to the fore around the same age but i didnt know what it was & no-one helped me tbh he really needs to speak to a doctor or counsellor its scary embarrassing frustrating at first but its so important reassure him hes not on his own and although you dont know how hes feeling you are there with him every step of the way he needs people he can talk to (maybe not even someone close) & most of all your support i hope things get better for him remember it can be chemical & not anyones fault xx,0
just keep being supportive ive battled depression (and at times been suicidal) since i was about 11 so i understand how hes feeling and honestly just knowing my parents knew was terrifying but a relief as well their support meant more to me than anything! just keep open dialogue with him dont judge and be patient on the days when he may be less receptive your suggestions and help also though keep an eye out for when he starts to withdraw for extended periods of time this will likely be when the suicidal thoughts are returning eventually he will need to see a doctor so dont force that on him if you can help it but keep it on the table as an option for when he is ready (i was in my 20s when that time finally came wish i wouldve gone sooner now) but if he starts to get worse instead of better you may have to make that choice for him just be prepared you will know if and when that time is,0
i think homeschooling is great in certain situations but im sorry to sound like a smartass  youre assuming a lot from the original post if standard schooling had repeatedly failed then homeschooling may be a good idea but just to remove an already stressed child basically a from his community you are only going to exacerbate the problems,0
monday i bought a ukulele and today i can already play a couple songs this past week ive definitely spent a lot of time loving that and practicing and not just laying in bed doesnt have to be that in particular but if its music sports art anything he has a natural interest in maybe try to encourage him from that angle but other then that youre doing good just gentle suggestions/encouragement is best the anxiety that comes with depression can even make love and concern seem overbearing my parents have learned to balance they talk to me and tell me they love me every day but if i dont respond to texts or calls they know i probably just need some me time,0
my daughter is 15 and suffers from depression i couldnt get her to do anything like school (she still struggles with it) shopping hanging with friends nothing all she wanted to do was isolate herself and stay in bed i was at a loss i finally sat down with her and told her that i was really worried about her and of there was something i could do she of course told me no and to just go away and leave her alone well with me being a mother i told her that i couldnt just leave her alone i talked to her and said that i knew that she didnt want to talk to me or anyone in the family so i told her that she needed to talk to someone about her feelings and how to deal with all the stuff that was going on around her and it was making her feel i would set her up with someone outside of the family that would not judge her all they would do is listen i didnt use the word therapy or counseling just someone to talk to she finally agreed she has been seeing her counselor for over a year now and loves her she was also put on prozac and it does work for her i dont know if this helps but i thought i would put it out there just be there and let them know that they are loved,0
he needs a good psychiatrist the most proven med for depression and anxiety on the market for kids is fluxotene,1
keep doing what you are doing by encouraging him to do even just a couple of things a day let him know that you are always there if he needs to talk and that there is help available if he wants it encourage him to write things down let him keep it private if he wants or tell him that if he cant talk but would let you read what he had written it would be a great way of communicating without that awkward barrier of being a teenager ~vw~,0
coming from where he is i would say practice self love for yourself! if you two are meant to be then time will tell at some point you have to decide if giving your all is healthy for you he needs now support but it comes from medical professionals he is unable to make life decisions and he may push you away b/c he feels like letting you go is loving you i know thats why i did with so many in my past he is doing what he needs for himself right now and i understand all the investment you have made for your relationship but you must also decide if giving is best for you! you must self love first then love someone else i have pushed my husband so many times to divorce me b/c i felt sorry for him he is now learning self love and my guilt has lessen when i see him caring for not just me but himself its still a struggle most days but i do put him first at times to even our relationship no co-dependency anymore i hope this helps god bless you for your ❤️ and for loving him now its time to love yourself and that will help you decide whats best for you too not just him,0
if you can handle him at his worst and u really want him then hold on its a matter of time hell come around if u leave him he is going to be hurt and not want anything even commit suicide dont pressure him one thing for sure he will come around,0
i agree with jennifer tenhagen i feel for this man because im in the same boat years now ive pushed people away because i felt unworthy and i can tell you now pressuring him will make him push more and piss him off he needs time to breathe and think and focus on his health if he doesnt want visitors right now respect that ive had people try to talk to me pressure me force me out the house it just makes me mad all the questions and them annoying me i just want to be alone in the silence for a bit hell come to you if and when hes ready,0
he could be pushing back because of his depression or anxiety i think its very important that even though its a very difficult time for that you understand that its not the right time for him to make a decision he might very much love you but doesnt want to put you through the heartache of what he goes through & push you aw as you away because of that i think too that giving him time & being supportive and loving he will see that you are truly there for the long run who knows maybe thats what he needs to see best of wishes for the both of you,0
i do not have mania but citalopram is working for me for anxiety and related depression i was put on sertraline during my recent episode in dec-feb which should do the same thing - serotonin increase - but made me much much worse i went straight back to my gp and went on meds i knew worked for me in the past there are so many medications and so a degree of experimentation given everyone with brain illness is different we can call it the same thing bit we all experience these illness slightly differently and of course some worse than others it the same for the meds are you trying other things that are non pharmaceutical to try to manage your symptoms - for example meditation therapy/counselling etc see related web sites and resources at and ,1
i currently take abilify and find it to work wonders for my manic/depression but currently still have issues with anxiety,1
everyone is different they put me on a combination of medications to help with my depression anxiety and add they work well but they may not work well for you does your doctor do blood work to check the levels of the medication in your system?? or maybe try genetic tests that look for certain genes that resist meds??,1
you might ask your doctor about cymbalta i was the closest ive ever been to happy when i took that medication does wonders for anxiety too,1
im on 60mg of that great stuff nailed my stress and anxiety problems does make me drowsy tho but worth it,1
i currently take 10mg diazepam and 200mg of quitiapine as needed for anxiety and depression episodes i have tried many different meds and these seem to work the best please take care and good luck to you,1
i know this might sound silly but when you get like that try taking a really hot shower while listening to some music just make sure its upbeat feel-good music that usually helps me when i get to feeling all pissed off and crappy like that and dont just stand in the shower that gives your brain the opportunity to dwell on whatevers making you mad wash your hair shave brush your teeth etc anything thatll keep your mind focused on something other than whats going on in your head,0
let your family n friends know how you are feeling but also know its okay to feel how you are feeling but also know that you are not guilty or defeated even though you feel that way you can get through this its okay to have friends or family help perhaps you might let them know how you are feeling sometimes it just helps to have someone there things that can relax you can be walks i suggest daytime to take on vitamin d also a nice bubble bath with some upbeat music some find also to like meditation yoga exercise or even cooking as relaxing also take one day at a time you can do this just take it slow you can get through this it just takes time be patient with yourself,0
you need encouragement support n love to help you thru thisdo u like to read?! anger comes from avoidanceinspirational books with scriptures are very helpful n writing in a journal as wellyou are in my thoughts and prayersdont let the devil lie to you by telling you theres no hope n that your defeatedfight back n get your life back! ♡ xoxo,0
ooo i am scared i will take my medicines,1
wow! youve come a long way you just dont realize it i think that is i think that you dont realize it; i know that you have come a long way obviously i am also bipolar so please let me try to explain it in 500 words or less lol what i see is a sensitive strong caring woman who has despite the odds; found the diagnosis because she refused to quit searching for it i also have a little secret for you there are a lot of very successful and famous because of it people who were just where you are in life careerwise until one day   walt disney einstein bill gates and more google them in fact google everything it will tell you the same thing im about to tell you your mental illness is caused by brain chemical imbalances that is what causes bipolar disorder and depression; and thats physical so maybe your mother can relate to that and maybe she cant but its your problem and i dont think that you can count on much help from anyone around you right now and obviously you know that something has to change before it just keeps getting worse day in and day out i could be wrong about all this but i dont think so because i experienced the same things all of them doesnt it make you mad that we make ourselves hurt physically? and doesnt it make you mad that all we want to do sometimes is sleep? and doesnt it really make you mad that your not one of those people who get motivated when they get mad? at least not long enough to get where you want to be "me too!" i just get mad well i am going to tell you what has made differences in my life and maybe or maybe not you can try them and see if they help you #1 dont ever give up on god or think that god has given up on you you are wonderfully and fearfully made psalm 139 in his image genesis 1 (later im going to tell you about a daily devotional i came accross in sam"s club of all places it has changed my life) #2 i said earlier that this is your problem not because i dont know how you have tried and tried to deal with it but dealing with things or i guess i should say not being able to deal with things is a symptom a symptom of your illness; not a personality trait when people are experiencing symptoms mental or physical that they are unable to get relief from they need assistance with this there are lots of places and people that are willing to help you with the process of recovery from total disfunction you might try to google or search your yellow pages under counseling or something similar ask whoever answers a phone for assistance on where to go if not there who to call if not them your school might even have resources through the academic counseling office #3 when you do find who is right for you; if you still are out of school and work apply for social security disability you are entitled to receive assistance with this to provide you with health insurance and financial support this is always a timely grueling process and you will automatically be denied several times everyone always is get an attorney right away to help you file and appeal there are ones who specialize in assisting us and they dont want any money from you unless and until you win your case dont feel like your above this or that you dont deserve the assistance thats your illness and people who are not experiencing what you are talking i think your family loves you dearly but they truly dont understand not a lot of people do; in fact it wasnt that long ago that they just diagnosed us nuts instead of chemically imbalanced thank god for science #4 you already do this never give up i promise to be praying for you and when you can get this book ill send you some example pages i swear its like it was written for us its like jesus talking right to me about exactly what i need to hear when i need to hear it its called "jesus calling" experiencing peace in his presence by sarah young,0
i took it it reflected that the drugs that hadnt worked for didnt metabolize well in my system it also said i would be good with benzos which is kinda true because after two weeks my body was so addicted i to them that it took months to wean off of them ( highly addictive drugs but i didnt know that) so it was accurate it can help you avoid things that wont be useful to you,1
i went though 2 break down my depression was so bad and anxiety what go me though was eating healthy food i seen social worker and used breathing in and out to help me calm and i use we go to the water a lot look over and sea waves and hear them relaxes youand i use to take magnesium it help your nerves and cramps and neck pain i use to get a lot of that from my anxiety i went and seen a natural doctor ,1
distract yourself by doing simple things like colouring reading watching a movie or researching research cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness they are therapies and techniques used by psychologists and psychiatrists to treat depression and anxiety you might find some ideas you can try there are even mindfulness apps you can download you need to see your dr and let them know you arent doing well you cant just snap out of it it takes a lot of hard work but its worth it,1
depression / anxiety isnt something you just snap out of the road to recovery is a lengthy process,1
yes ive had bipolar disorder for about 55 years but was diagnosed only about 30 years ago i was a teacher and the strain of putting on by happy face daily finally pushed me into a very early in retirement im very hard to treat so the best i can get is to be only functional ive been isolating now for a long time so i know im not in great shape,0
my anxiety and depression is so bad i cant leave the house i also feel like people are always watching me,0
yes sometimes i was diagnosed at age 12 and am 31 now it may be worse with age because there are more responsibilities to worry about but ive been trying all sorts of medication combinations and therapy and have learned to manage my bipolar better (i am ultradian bipolar - mood swings in days or even hours) it also helps to have support from friends family and even those of us here online who also experience the same issues we are here for you even if we dont know you ,0
i have suffered from depression ptsd and severe anxiety i can find it very difficult to leave the house and cant do the simplest of tasks like washing ive been suicidal in the past,1
yeah i struggle to get out too its definitely gotten worse the past few years since turning 18,0
i was diagnosed when i was 26 with bipolar and now i am 44 as i am getting older my manic episodes have been getting under control and i have been working these past 3 years i was told by my psych dr caseworkers and my own family that i shouldnt get a job because i will relapse well i am pretty proud of myself because i work in the mental health field in the same place i have been receiving services for almost 20 years i would pray so much to get my old self and life back and its happening i feel so blessed i want others who struggle with their diagnosis to know that its ok to feel defeated but you can never give up and we are strong,0
i have alot of days i struggle with that too,0
i am 31 and lived my whole life with the illness and was diagnosed at 30 as a child i always new i was not fine my emotions were uncontrollable and i did not understand got bad from 25 as a result i almost lost my life attempted suicide thats how i got diagnosed i am taking my meds going to therapy but everyday is a struggle i battle i thought i should be fine by now i have been taking meds for a year and 4 months,0
i am struggling more as i get older and finding so little joy lately,0
yes i am 59 and am having a horrible mixed episode which quite seriously scares me- i had a side effect from my go to mood stabilizer and ever since life is quite the roller coaster- finally i pursuaded them to let me try it again and see if my sodium goes to low again i eat salt all day long now,0
i have been on viibryd for about 5-6 months i think at first i was irrationally angry a lot we found a dose that works for me and it seems to have been better but i am also diagnosed with bipolar disorder so sometimes i cant distinguish if what im feeling is the medicine or if ive just spiraled into an angry few days i would say talk to your physician about upping your dosage we did so after about 15 months all in all this medicine has saved me i was on zoloft for 7 months and felt no difference viibryd helped me feel "human" or at least able to get out of bed more often than not it gets better ,0
i woz diagnosed at 47 49 now have been hosp for 8 weeks due to a anxiety and depression,1
 how we feel is connected to what we think what we think is connected to what we believe what we believe is connected to god only knows these days this depends on what we were taught and who taught us happiness is a state of mind that can only exist in the present moment a bad day after bad day makes a bad week a bad month a bad year bad year after bad year makes a bad life all the fault of how we think each moment of everyday our thought habits control our present moment learning to control the way we think controls the way we feel this book contains a sure fire method that will allow us all to understand and control what we think; which allows us to finally be in control of how we feel this book will help all people to understand their emotional motivation but will be especially helpful to those who suffer chronically from anxiety depression ptsd and bipolar disorder the information contained in this book has changed my life from a 36 year intense emotional roller coaster ride into a path of daily peace calm stability and progress i prayed to the universal wisdom (our creator aka god) to take me out or show me the way preferably to show me the way but i really had my doubts back then i asked for the answer i asked for the key to turn my life around i promised i would share this answer with all who suffer like i suffered; if my answers were made clear to me my wish was granted writing this book allows me to keep that promise i cant wait until you are able feel the same ways too as i am able to feel today our past does not have to equate our future change is indeed possible and much closer than we may think i stand by this book i am proud of the information contained within; it has allowed me to finally begin to enjoy each moment of everyday; instead of just reacting to it and hoping happiness shows up someday i know our emotions can make us needy and very impatient so this book is intentionally designed to be succinct to the point and as quick of a read as possible yes yes indeed we can all learn how to start feeling better,0
when its actual mental illness its not easier to play on a phone or watch a moviewhy not? because yes it seems easier but our head doesnt let it be we are thinking about what needs to be done why didnt i just do it? maybe i can just do it but if you try you will fail youre so worthless you cant do this everyone knows youre worthless and stupid hell even your own mom hates you dont you see it everything she looks at you cant you hear it in her voice shit like that and it keeps going so yes i may have a netflix show on or try playing a game when i should be filling out paperwork for something that will really fuck me up later but my head is talking shit im on the verge of crying and trying not to so nobody knows im upset because i feel nobody cares it gets so bad im fighting myself as to whether or not i should continue wasting the space on this planet and the only reason im still here is so i dont fucking up my kids so dont tell me mental illness is being fucking lazy,0
and i too am a percentage of laziness  with huge bouts of un laziness but i cant seem to do those adult things i always mean to but i dunno y i just dont follow thru until my mum was murdered she was amazing she gently coaxed me from my dark hole others try to push and threatened and gave up a constant rock is the most wobderful saviour for mental illness,0
happens to me lots days when i cant function or go out the door and many pyjama days that sometimes make me feel guilty but it is what it is and i think because ive not been able to work for a really long time ive got no friends and cant make myself find new ones because im not reliable because of a weather phobia so i can only go out spur of the moment which is difficult and hard to have friends when you cant plan ,0
i still am not sure what is wrong with me but my gp is treating for anxiety but ready this is helping a bit thank you,1
i began to notice this after my last depressive episode but i also noticed its been happening even before that i would normally push myself but become irritable on those days im working on that now and learned how to manage it therell be days that i cant though but its okay im still starting to learn it afterall,0
yeah know the feeling about every three days or maybe four my energy zaps to a very low point which in turn makes me really miserable where i do almost nothing depending on who you talk to will depend on the answers for me i monitor the activity i do and know i have to pace myself or hit a low point that can last for a few days (fibro sufferer) i started taking vitamin d3 again and some coq10 it helps to give the immune system a little boost which in turn boosts the ability to cope slightly better i would suggest using something like the fibromapp app ideal for monitoring and you can customise it pacing yourself during the up days may also help with energy on the low days if youre having issues sleeping whether it be physical or mental pain just chill out if you can the more you fight it the worse it becomes the energy cycle has many factors lastly have a look into yoga stretching and breathing techniques the latter is very important to how we heal internally plenty of yt vids around for free the stretching is only stretching no weights or press ups etc just simple stretching techniques along with the breathing is a good energy maker throw in some relaxing music quietness and hopefully 10 20 30 minutes of this will help a little or a lot,0
happens to me a lot i try my best to stick to my routine but its normally be dialed back instead of a long run just a short easy one to get stretched out at least if i wanted to get 3 assignments for school done that day ill settle for one maybe two maybe even sneak in a nap i really avoid just letting myself veg out all day then guilt/anxiety about not getting anything done makes me shut down again and it becomes a vicious cycle but keeping a consistent and nutricious diet keeping a consistent schedule and routine but still accepting the days im not quite superman helps me the most also remembering to take whatever meds youre prescribed consistently too,0
been dealing with exactly this for 2 years i am on 600mg arorix it worked really well for 3 yearssaw a psych and he said its a long process to jump off them and a 2 week wait after that to get on a ssriso over living with this i never feel happy let alone that joy thing that people talk about totally socially phobicand im a social workerinsanity ,0
yes i have days like thati just sat straight up in the bedsome kind of dreamits 3:30 ami just got upfeel a little panicky,0
def feel for you n yes i go through this a few days a wk n its just horrible n hard when some dont understand n judge n criticize you makes your emotions n mind n anxiety panic worse i try go for walk or call n have a yarn with someone who understands n it helps  also 2mg antanex helps in these situations for me anyway good luck n know your not alone  feel free to pm me when n if u need a yarn it does help  all the best darl  truly feel for ya,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page i just cannot pretend that this will ever get better i cannot pretend there is a purpose for this torment grief is not a leson it is a feeling pain is not there to make us stronger it has no purpose mental illnes does no go away,1
hate the way mine make me feel sometimes except the anxiety one that ones awesome,0
ya know i didnt even realize my anxiety meds might help me chill tf out rn lol thanks xd,1
have you seen a doctor? youre anxiety and depression may be clinical looking for relief in a relationship is a recipe for disaster you deserve medical support and a good psycoligistespecially one who understands the college stuff good luck x,1
hi im 22 i have some similar history when i was in college my anxiety was super high and i would miss school due to it i even failed a class because of it and i had no motivation first thing is to just breathe idk if you are on medications or anything but talking to someone and/or going to a psychiatrist for something is nothing to be ashamed of i couldnt function without medications literally i used to work at the childcare center at my local community college if you find little pleasure in your work thats okay for now you always need goals short term and long term it might be hard to find a passion at first i dont know who you are but i have a suggestion try something in the medical field i am in ems i could not live without it i love it whatever you settle for youve got this!,0
heyyo im 23 so its not like i have arrived or anything but a few things helped me when i was feeling lost and lonely and unsure about my direction: first i think how weve designed school and the continuity from high school to college is pretty unfair my mom changed careers more than 5 times and shes 60 now flourishing in yet another direction! i would strongly recommend taking a break semester or two focus all your energy to change up your field from the current jobs you dont feel joy with do a bunch of new hobbies and maybe taking up a sport or a a rec center if your jobs budget allows it i know too many amazing people who are chained to jobs they hate because they got a degree in something they werent keen on and are now too in debt to experiment travel or start something new learn about yourself what jobs you love (maybe thats just not childcare anymore i tapped out of that gig when i was 21 xd) what jobs you cant do and hate then build from there to see what you want to do with your day and what kind of job lets you do that then what qualifications you need to become the best in that field second nothing made me feel more isolated and depressed than my problematic images of college; dont get me wrong i loved being in college and had an awesome time but after a high school career of having built-in friends based on who was in my 20-30 people classes and watching movies about how college is a nonstop party to find your destiny and make your "real friends" i felt i was doing something wrong when college was exhausting huge nerve wracking and not st all like a sorority movie youre learning how to be a functional adult after being raised in a society that tells teens that their feelings are irrelevant and phasic while also having high expectations and giving them basically no life prep (soooo glad i carried around a bag of flour for a week instead of learning how to access birth control and that i can do advanced calculus but not my taxes :d) that pressure combined with the idealistic image of what college is/should be like can make you feel like a real failure! its not true :) youre just learning how to stand survive and thrive entirely solo and thats hard and thats ok third and less helpfully ive also had a ton of issues with relationships often because i speak different love languages and have different needs (nice way of saying im depressed/anxious/needy) and have honestly found living alone with a dog to be my answer i dont have an aversive view of relationships and will happily take one up but have just experienced from living with partners that i am better in a relationship when i have all the space and independence of living alone it sounds hokey but honestly until you have no fear of living and being alone even love it especially if youre neurodivergent or have particular needs partners can and will use fear of isolation to keep you in situations that do not serve you first (not even necessarily abusive justif you need them cause youre afraid of that isolation they may not view you as precious and may not cherish you the way you deserve it can be tiring to be in a relationship with someone who is anxious and ive had some partners feel over-entitled to my labor in our relationships because they "put up with me") fourth self-care is radical take long baths go for long walks paint sing pet a dog buy yourself flowers if you can afford it the world may feel like its closing in and crushing but it can wait long enough for you to go outside those are the moments youll really remember the memories youll cherish and the substance that makes your life school and qualifications are just supposed to open doors for you to do what you love not loadstones or something to battle through just for that you got this tl;dr: if youre not sure take a break from college and find your passion then go back to school for that society talks up college so we all feel inadequate regardless what we do there get a dog and live alone alone is awesome ;d,0
i say try and relax about things focus on your school and where you want to go from there jobs almost always offer little pleasure so dont feel that you need to be in love with your work (it would be better of course but hopefully thatll be fixed after your education is finished) you mentioned enjoying working with children maybe find something that would allow you to continue that interest dont worry about relationships like you said youre 20 i got married at 21 and it was a disaster because i had so little life expirence at the time there is no rush love will happen when it is ready,0
dont worry about relationships god will send him when hes ready learn to love yourself first maybe you could take electives until you decide what you want to do with college early education is a good field to get in to we always need teachers good luck to you on your journey ,0
its nothing to be embarrassed about eitheri feel the same way at times and most people do,0
yes 18 yrs now to finally have an official diagnosis bipolar 2 which i refer to as the less of the 2 evils right now i am struggling and i suspect its because i am so inconsistent with meds and exercise please try you will see a difference and trust me we never are boring,1
thank you jodie my daughter suffers from depression as does my daughter in law my son suffers from schizoaffective/anxiety he is actually looking at getting one also i was diagnosed 7 years ago when i was 42 its been a battle and some days it still is,1
i have my alarms set to remind me both morning and night meds,1
nothing is in control stresses me more i dont believe in a higher power and i am learning that i cant control everything but the thought of having no control is too terrifying,0
seroquel didnt make me gain but it made me like a zombielamictal made me sick to the stomach and im weaning off prozac right now and havent felt this good in a long timeim on buspirone now and trazodone for anxiety n sleep and will be starting zoloft on the 10th,0
seroquel is the weight killer when i was on it i had gained over 120 pounds in just under 2 and a half years since i switched doctors and this 1 took me off of that dreaded pill and switched me to topamax i have since lost 96 of those pounds and also feel better too topamax is also fda approved as a weight loss aid as it does not slow the metabolism down like most psychotropic drugs in its class,1
i do occasionally have the shakes in my hands and the rls symptoms at night not enough to make me change my regimen never had the rash,0
i am on combo of effexor and lamictal as well and it is the best i have ever been however i do suffer from the shakes restless leg syndrome and tiredness but havent ever had a rash and this is the second time i have been on this combination,1
i took 1 tablet 25mg and ended up in the emergency room never again im scared of that stuff,0
lamictal made me nervous and jittery unable to focus or sit still,0
i had horrible uncontrollable mood swings i had to stop taking it after 2 weeks,1
being selfish keeping good boundaries up and try to catch yourself overthinking/worrying those all have helped me,1
i was on the borderline of crisis management a month ago quit my 6 yr job during a panic phase i was shaking uncontrollably for 5 days severe anxiety so bad id get up and look out windows or jump at any sound couldnt eat or sleep for 3 days now i feel grounded ,0
i am bipolar one manic depressant with severe panic and anxiety and yes self love can be done with practice,1
i used to feel like that im everybodys first call when there in trouble but when i need support no one comes because i act strong people assume independent when im anything but! i learned to say no and put myself first by explaining dealing with there negative emotions when trying to help them added to mine like a sponge i soaked up there feelings as im really empathetic this year i told anyone if things in there life become toxic or stressful please take my emotional state into consideration before relying on me to fix your dramas as every time i do i loose a part of myself and one day i may be broken beyond help it was hard to say but i done it for myself because no one else was ever gonna put my needs first took me years to realize that x,0
stop worrying about everyone else stop worrying about society and enjoy yourself  love life and breathe,0
society shapes your thoughts and perceptions as to what is acceptable and what is not we eat it all up like a parasite then it manifests itself in mental disorders bc the brain and our emotions are overwhelmed so yes society do you boo,1
worry about society? no,0
and that shit is so confusing and racing around in your head and 1000 miles an hour and you cant get your words out because its just too much going on sometimes its best to stay silent as you say,0
i am guilty of all the above and it aggravates my family when they need me to remember,0
im on both and the memory loss sucks i often have complete mental blanks that are frustrating and embarrassing but its just another side effect to put up with for the sake of health,0
cody cassidy this this is what its like before i go into depression or anxiety,1
i find something positive to dwell on exercise faith etc i have stopped telling myself that i am going to feel "bad" and this in itself has helped tremendously you will be what you think you are sick sad etc this is not to downplay anyone on medsjust saying reading all these posts will depress anyone,0
i am worried because this is mw atm and having a wisdom tooth infection only makes it easier to excuse not interacting with others :p hope you are ok reets,1
this scares me to deathbut i can feel it starting up again and after reading this i just know its a matter of time now im so tired of fighting everyday already i cant even imagine it getting worse again,0
i avoid having a relationship due to my depression & not wanting to go anywhere or communicate with other people & sometimes find it hard to get out of bed or even getting out my pjs & getting dressed for the day its horrible no one understands me i have no support,0
after reading this ive realised ive being doing all of that over the last couple of weeks now im worried ,0
i dont avoid certain conversations i avoid all conversations other peoples neuroses are projected onto my own,0
i live in this horrible place and its real bad some days and then its better it will never go away unfortunately for me but i do have good days and i live for those and my family,0
please see your gp asap you dont have to struggle alone talk to someone about how you are feeling there are options if you dont want to see a doctor - maybe lifeline?,0
i hear some ofu say be nice to yr self but when the beast enters the room i just get so mad because i see everything through a different lensso much anxiety i feel like my chest wants to blow up,0
just a question who diagnoses these disorders? ive usually been diagnosed by a doctor for depression and anxiety but people around me seem think i have something closer to bipolar i just want it worked out because im the same the highs are the best but the lows are super flat like i have no heart im on 150mg zoloft but its stopped working after 5 years of slowly upping the dose,1
pushing people away is part of the illness there are a lot of symptoms in what you said that are very common i am concerned that you are still working though what part of the world are you living in can you not take sick leave and get sickness pay from the level of stress that youre under i would suggest reducing your working hours i know its tough but sometimes you need to do it i reduced my working week about 10 years ago and it has helped me no end i would also try and find a group that you can go to say through a charity that deals with mental health you may be able to talk it out with them depression is a dreadful animal and it makes you more and more isolated this is a vicious circle i have had depression all my life ive learnt to deal with it the good and the bad if you ever want to inbox me and have a chat online im more than happy to do that,0
effexor can be a godsend for some people but when mixed with other medsor even by itself it can carries a high risk for causing suicidal thoughts please talk to your doc hospitals have programs that help pay for what your insdoesnt i used to work in the dept that does that just once you are past the crisis ask to speak to someone in either case management or social work and explain your financial situation and ask them to help you apply for whatever resources you need to cover the remainder of your bills and they will direct you to the right formsetcand if you need help you fill them out i hope this helps finances should never prevent someone from getting the care they need when they have a crisis my best wishes to you,1
a bigger dose knocked me out i started reading anxiety for dummies and praying reading positive affirmations very helpful,1
i take 10 mg of propranolol 3x daily to keep my anxiety at bay it doesnt make me drowsy or loopy or anything i have xanax for really bad days or days when i have to leave the house,0
i deal with anxiety on a regular basis i have to calm myself down first then start my breathing exercises usually goes away in an hour or so,1
i too needed larger doses of ativan but would forget entire days so i flushed them it was scary!,0
effexor! i was on lithium for 15 years!!! but after being attacked and not realizing the danger fast enough i realized it was the lithium it puts you in a state where you can feel neither happy or sad you just dont feel anything! not even fear since the change i feel awake!!! still have highs and lows but extreme like they were! also realizing that "all people" will disappoint you because there "people!" i have been on it for 4 years now,0
lithium just makes you fact serequol makes you like a zombie abiify have to watch i took higher doses and became confused lamictal seems to be what there pushing these days,0
trick with remeron is to keep to a higher dosage 45-60 unless theyre using it for sleep then it needs to be 75-30 mg also found effexor worked great for depression and anxiety added with 75mg remeron nightly that totals my depression and anxiety; still have traumatic anxiety but thats getting treated separately,1
thank you guys i am just so frustrated i just want to be fixed ive been having way more bad days then good i have been diagnosed with major depression generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder i take my medicine like im suppose to and its not helping,1
mood stabilizers dont get rid of the anxiety or the pd so you dont feel fixed that waysome bipolar people have no comorbid anxiety or pd or trauma ptsd or ocd etc so mood stabilizers do make them feel "fixed" most of the time as for the rest we have something else going on most of the timeall the time,0
you may need a combination just be open and willing to try new meds im on a combo but im bipolar 2 with depression and anxiety so i take extra antidepressants,1
i wouldnt take both of those they are both good but up my anxiety i take lithium and trazadone the lithium does make me a little sick though i know trying all these meds are horrible and super rough you need medication though keep trying ,1
its a side effect called akathisia i suggest talking to your pdoc about it it can get really bad its like restless leg syndrome but all over your body ugh worst side effect ever,0
i did the same so i did go off all meds i think im handling the daily struggle of life pretty well,0
my meds got switched to lamictal klonopin celexa and something else and i started twitching too almost like restless leg syndrome? im not sure what to do either?,1
latuda gave me tremors hated it they can become permanent dont quit it cold turkey tho cuz the withdrawal is horrible have dr help u,0
lamictal/lamotrigine was the best medication i ever tried i picked it myself its an anticonvulsant that seconds as a mood stabilizer so theres minimal risk unfortunately i got bad physical side effects after a while but mentally it worked i still highy recommend it,1
theres the "text book" answer & then theres the personal experiences/ symptoms that are unique to each person who has bipolar its a mood disorder that is unpredictable debilitating paralyzing with depression anxiety etc,1
in bipolar 2 it can i was told im a textbook example but its possible i have both and why not? i also have anxiety issues paranoia hallucinations scored high on an autism spectrum disorder test (unofficial but makes a lot of since) and if i didnt have bipolar disorder id most likely be a psychopath (prozac numbed all emotion so i dunno if that is how i really am or if that was just the meds),1
same here for me its hard because being diagnosed almost 2yrsi still havent come to terms with it and living in a society where once the words mental illness are mentioned words like mad crazy and nuts come to mindi must admit im a bit ashamed so i basically struggle on my own  ive stopped going to the doctor and taking any meds most day are good but then the lows come and i fight to feel better its​ exhausting the thoughts of suicide it there most days and to ease that invisible pain i need a physical pain  i use to cut or scratch my arm i bit a littleit soothes me  oh my i really needed to share so freeing,0
full disclosure: i have been living with bipolar 1 disorder (diagnosed) since i was 15 years old i had my first manic episode when i was 12 i will be 44 in may i have been on and off medications currently on them: 1200 mg of lithium and 150 mg of trazodone for almost six years in my 30 years i have self medicated in the past with booze and drugs promiscuous sex stealing driving and behaving out of control thats just the tip of my mania iceberg after a heightened state of mania that (for me) can last months i have debilitating crashing lows that send me to my bedroom and pajamas for weeks at a time i am extremely fortunate to have an amazing support group in my life that dont let me linger long in either state i still deal with mania (especially when im excited about something) and depression (not as much these days but i still have a day or two once a month where im in a funk) medication is not a be all end all but it does make my life possible side effects of my meds can be troublesome but they are a lot more agreeable than the hell i live through without my meds i have amazing relationships with my family and friends (no exaggeration here--i am a lucky woman on this front) a full-time job that i love and am excited to get up for five days a week and volunteer work that fills my heart and spirit i have struggled to get to where i am today but it is possible to have a fulfilling and functional life with mental illness,0
me with depression and anxiety several police interventions 1 legal hold and 4 hospitalizations 2x in a partial hospitalization program a couple of suicide attempts abandoned and isolated cant trust anyone can hardly function on a day to day basis hate this disease was actually a licensed independent clinical therapist before i lost everythingwhen im manic im unstoppable when im depressed i can hardly get out of bed what happened? people say you can still live a full and productive life with this disease i ask how?,0
thanksyou guys!!i was diagnose with bipolaranxietyand major depressive disorder about 7 months ago and still trying to get a full understanding of my mental illnesses,1
its been a rocky journey indeed!!!i struggle alot still with my meds and therapy but im hanging in therei wish you well and best of luck also,0
i learned to do tapping therapy also chinese hand massage and pressure points to relieve stress i put a crystal in each cup of by bra tigers eye for self confidence and rose quartz for love as im very spiritual i also distract myself from what people are doing around me by looking out for white feathers or pennies a sighn my angels are around me although i do really struggle with going into my own garden to cut grass for any length of time or even open curtains most days i can leave my street and be in amongst strangers easier than around my neighbors most times,0
throw yourself into like diving into a pool you want to swim but dont want that initial ice-cold sensation it can make you anxious but you just grin and bear it warm weather is good for the mood and i believe ultimately anxiety reducing go surprise yourself!,0
i face the fear and do it anyway,0
yes i can understand as i have depression and anxiety as well as vitiligo it isnt easy at any given day ,0
sometimes its a matter of pushing yourself i know part of me wants to go out and enjoy things but the other part says no i make a plan and prepare myself by putting a post it note on the fridge a to do in my phone and no matter how much i dont want to do it i make myself so i can tick it off my to do list small accomplishments really help depression and anxiety its all about pushing through its not easy but its worth it,0
i relatei cant bring myself to go outside when i need toand if i donti get upset and feel worse because i wasted another day,0
i was on lamotragine for about a year and it worked great for me but i guess my body got used to it or something and it randomly stopped working and since then ive been struggling for about 6 months trying to find something else that works as well as the lamotragine did,1
i don’t know if this will help anyone here one of my first symptoms was allot of anxiety depression and panic attacks in my case related to soy lecithin none of you realize soy could be the root it’s in everything and you all od on it every day it’s in your makeup lip stick cooking spray toothpaste mouthwash waxes all dugs contain soy all pills contain soy vegetables and fruits at the markets anything shiny is covered in soy wax the chickens and cows are fed soy it’s in your perfume is in allot of sodas it’s in allot kids medicine im severely sensitive to it all the feeling of anxiety panic attacks brain fog memory issues and infections disappeared when i removed soy out of my life its extreme if you go that route the last thing giving me soy was a tooth i had to remove a root canal done because the filling in the root space contained soy hope this helps someone here soy makes you sick ,1
i cant even find where to write im so from manic depression feel like just walking yet parilsed don know where to go anywayanxiety is up ever since i came home from my trip i find partner acting like a holebut im guessing inthis state of mind itsprobably just misarble me just making him misarableany suggestion im really a big mess,0
how do i stop this horrible weight gain? my doctor wont help me ive tried dieting weve tried a prescription diet pill ive been so depressed ive eaten one time a day at work im on my feet all day i dont go to the gym and work out its not my thing ever im also on prozac topamax trileptal inderal nuviguil i weigh the most i ever have and that makes me more freaking depressed,0
if you have high blood pressure there is only one diuretic that you can take with lithium or you will stop making urine an start retaining such huge amount of fluids that you will get elephantitis,1
i dont have any works perfect for me never fort i be me again and yea im back as me but i dose put on weight but dont let that scare u,0
took it for one month made me very shakey and dizzy,1
thank you so much abilify has a lot of side affects including weight gain i truly hope he takes me off the abilify im already taking amitriptylin cymbalta for depression/anxiety im have a total of 17 medications,1
avoid sudden changes in doseage gradually is better,1
i like to sleep a lot when i go to bed its like ive turned off all the worry and stress,1
i hadnt cut for 5 years but last week i ended up cutting myself hoping i dont decide to again cause of this struggle of getting my medicaid reapproved because the state has not yet accepted it yet so i can get my mood enhancers so im not flipping shit,0
yes i know i cry eating i look constantly in the mirror and when i eat i feel upset because i ate i try to eat broccoli and tuna or oatmeal but i also love chocolate too much and i really really want this to stop i cant keep harming myself like this,0
small stepsbaby stepsits not failureit may not even be a total relapse - strongsits never easy when things get overwhelming,0
i dont cut but i do self harm by scratching myself sometimes i dont realize it and sometimes i do ive drawn blood many times and then will pick the scabs my therapist and i are working on it but its really had to break the habit because when i have anxiety attacks ill break out in hives and itch really bad has anyone suggested alternate ways to focus your need to self harm?? i have yet to find something to distract myself,1
thats whst i do to but now not allowed tattoos so im struggling again not to self harm,0
its not as easy as a lot of people think even ex-cutters some people dont have as much as a daily struggle as certain other people i know for myself and quite a few others i have met it is almost an addiction like alcholism or drugs for various other reasons but it can cause similar symptoms when it comes to withdrawal etc what you need to realize is this may make it harder for the next few weeks to hell even months of getting back on the horse of no longer doing it but dont stop trying just breathe pick yourself up and start running after that damned train that left you behind theres no reason you cant be amazing and great at the moment just shoot for something a bit simple shoot for not cutting for a week every week you dont cut allow yourself a treat you dont often get whether its chocolate special coffee something really simple and cheap once you hit that month mark buy yourself a dinner out tell someone whether its someone who personally knows you or not tell someone who knows how hard it is so they can correctly celebrate with you once you hit that six months i do something like alcoholics do i buy myself a token of some sort to mark the day then i buy a different one for a year and so on i usually do something really geeky because i am a geek and do something with pokemon and evolutions just remember every time you feel the desire there are other ways to get the release may if it will help write down your other coping strategies where you keep your cutting tool? if you want feel free to message me on facebook i will happily be that person to celebrate a no-cutting week with you ^^,0
look for another job that is less stressful,1
ive also done this before i was so busy doing something else and dont respond to my friends messages but i didnt mean to make her feel like i dont care i always read her messages and it always makes me happy but when its time to reply i get overwhelmed i dont know where and how to start eventhough ive already responded to them in my mind so i always end up not replying and that made her feel like shes not important anymore that ive made new friends and dont need her anymore but thats not true at all yes ive made a lot of friends but its diferrent those new friends although i value them are not as important as her so if youve been there through the hard times i bet your friend has already thought of how precious you are but some of us just suck at showing/expressing it and i think its the same with your friend so i really hope you stay with him he needs you more than you think but of course dont stay just because he needs you stay because you want to hell appreciate that more(i assume since most of us dont want people to stay just because they feel obligated) and if you really wanna get his attention back tell him how you feel or if you cant tell him maybe ignoring him would work? thats what my friend did she didnt just ignore my messages she also unfollowed me on twitter i got so paranoid that time i thought ive gone crazy thought shes not real that my mind just made her to make me feel better that i thought i have a friend but im actually alone its terrifying but that made me become more aware of what she feels and realize shes not like me whos okay with no communication as long as i know shes there(and shes real lol),0
really difficult to enquire without putting on or seemingly to put him under pressure if in mania maybe wants to blot out all things associated with his depressive episode which unfortunately includes your kindnesses you could write expressing your wish to be there whatever but its his call and if it doesnt come you have to understand and respect that try to find out more about the psychology of sufferers a bit more but note we are all different there is no one catch-all description of behaviour everyone behaves differently however mind- boggling to may be to you,0
it is wonderful how supportive youre being please keep doing it - as long as its not negatively affecting you with my depression i often shut people out and its awful to watch friendships die but being powerless to do anything to stop it i feel so blessed when ive been super distant from people due to anxiety and depression but several people continue to text and call and when im ready to talk theyre available and nothing between us has changed you are a wonderful person for not giving up on your friend,0
ive done this before id get manic be hyper active going out etc but wouldnt feel up to socializing with those i cared about most - for various reasons you are a true friend to stick it out through the highs and lows but also remember being a good friend doesnt mean you have to feel you bear any responsibility for his well being sounds as if he hasnt made the leap to medications yet there will be times when the friendship feels heavy and one sided if you need some time so you dont feel burnt out take it it will help reaffirm your friendship it took me until my 30s to get stable i was a huge flake due to my anxiety and depressive episodes and then everyone would think i was crazy when i was manic and avoid me so i avoided them instead,0
it replaced it for me most of the timeover the last 15 yrs i have had periods of deep depression or where rarely the mania would rear its ugly head and i would have to take a low dose of extrelease lithium for a while until things got back under control i also have fibro ptsd and a blood clotting disorder that can cause strokes severe migraines and blood clots i take anxiety meds and cymbalta as well daily when i first went on the topomax i was severely overweight the topomax helped me remedy that in combination with a good diet i lost over 100 lbs in less than a yrso quickly in fact that the doctors said id lost too much and made me gain some back =~p lithium seems to be the only drug (im allergic to alot of others) that can fairly quickly help me to be myself again i hope this help good luck to you,1
i just want to say you are one brave strong and amazing person for opening up and coming for help i was diagnosed bipolar anxiety and panic attacks 2 years ago i still have those thoughtsthose demons still always try to escape and ruin everything i have and sometimes i almost let them winbut go to him let him help you fight those demons as much as he canhe can make you strongeryou have more strength then you knowget your head up lift yourself up you can do itim fighting them as well right now just knowyou can do itshes proof you can walk through hell and still be an angel,0
unbelievable!! whoo!! first thing first i want to appreciate you being so opened minded ive living with bipolar anxiety and major insomnia and depression i will be very honest i was like that many years ago but first things first we must accept admit our mental illnesses only us indidviuals​ ​whom are living can only explain to our soulmates but we must conquer defeat discipline our minds thoughts yes its very hard but mind over matter if we driving ourselves insane crazy; i can imagine our loved ones that dont deal cope w that illnesses pray my friend be strong focus on daily days being at ease jolly content i know its very hard but this is one way to express our thoughts feelings expression what i do first thing i wake up i thank the man my savior jesus thanks for another day of life! then focus staying positive keep away from negative human beings really! i will keep supporting all my friends to give them strength support and never give up! remember today is gone perhaps tomorrow is not promised! love yourself respect yourself forgive yourself believe yourself and faith talk to jesus ask him w all your heart & soul for strengh and plenty of patience remember were all gods children! he loves us unconditionally! god is good all the time to everyone! no matter what good or bad situations were dealing in our lives! stay strong to survive! ,0
topamax for my migraines and it has done nothing for my weight cymbalta for my anxiety nothing for weight either,1
im on topamax for migraines ive lost about 15 pounds in just over a month my taste buds are completely different and my appetite is shot so even though ive basically been stuck on bed rest because of spine surgery i lost the weight its rough to titer up on and its not called dopamax for nothing but if you can stick it out some of the dopey issues gets better im still losing weight the food aversion and taste bud issues are still there but im learning what i can tolerate and what i cant avoiding sweets and fatty foods helps a great deal it seems to not agree with topamax ive been eating a lot of veggies grains less meats lots of water no coffee it makes me be healthier or it doesnt let me eat it or drink it and i honestly crave the healthy stuff i do have issues with some fruits though again its the sweet aversion thing ive heard some people who lost nothing felt nothing some who couldnt handle it at all i admit the first few weeks were rough it does depend on your dose as well,0
took it for 2 months last year for fibro and migraines really kick started my weight loss from the weight i gained on gabapentin but it made me severely nauseous and i had major food aversions so when i dropped 12 pounds in 60 days i was taken off,1
i am on topamax for migraines too it also helps me sleep i am bipolar with anxiety but i take other medication for that i did drop some weight; but it was not significant,1
the weight gain is what scares me ive already gained 35 pounds and feel awful i dont need more weight gain,0
nothing to be worried over but it elevated my white blood count,0
you need to push to see a psychiatrist or even just call simaritains and talk i overdosed on baclofen a few years ago and as they relax the muscles my heart rate practically stopped worse than that my 17 yr old son came home to find me sitting in the hall terrified i was seeing writing appearing on the wall all negative things i could hear music and shouting no one else couldnt by luck my son had a support worker he called who manged to talk me into going to hospital and convince me what i was perceiving to be real wasnt happening i was told at hospital overdose triggered a psychotic episode with severe paranoia and had to be prescribed medication for the normal use of scitzophrenia for two weeks till the hallucinations stopped it was the most terrifying experience iv ever had id never be as silly again i shudder to think what i could have done to myself or others if my son had not returned home and knew something was way wrong with me x,0
i struggle everyday with a disease over dosed twice within a month and died both times and to be honest i feel medicine can make it worse we are all ginny pigs it can take years to find the right meds if there is one i chose to do what makes me feel better not what they think,1
i would talk to your psychiatrist i was really struggling with my bipolar depression and my meds were not really helping me i was feeling like you after consulting my psychiatrist i decided to give ect a try it seems pretty extreme but ultra brief ect has turned my life around i feel so much better there is also tms which is working wonders for lots of people i know,0
im so glad i read this article i plan to subscribe to the magazine also i related to all 20 & a have a few more i have always been told that i am so negative since i was young i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of taking meds i decided to take myself of them i didnt like the way my brain felt it was almost numbing which i called zombietized i feel much better off those medications i would not recommend that others follow & copy this method when i find myself feeling like mood is hanging out to long i usually avoid socializing altogether,1
this is me 110% im in a down swing right now and cant stop it i dont know how to control it nor do i have any coping mechanisms ive been diagnosed with this but so far i havent been able to treat it because i refuse medicines i get scared of the side effects,0
i agree with this - but i wonder why we feel so guilty or lazy- is it the need to please?,0
i hear you i had 2 baby boys a workaholic husband and chronic depression with anxiety my toddler was an early riser and would wake baby brother up my baby was premature and on a 3 hour feeding schedule and could not suckle exhaustion is probably putting it lightly i found it so difficult to find time to rest and had insomnia that i was dragging butt all the time try all avenues to find a means to get good sleep maybe someone could watch your children or they could stay with a relative do this as a necessity top priority for you and your family you are essential for their well-being and for that you need to feel well and rested if moms not happy nobodys happy simple credo  hard to do i wish you sweet dreams!,1
very well said i dont have any of these illness but someone very close to me has and ive being consided crazy to the people around me because i didnt believe that if he got medicated that we were just gonna wake up and things were gonna go back to normal i wish it could work like that i really do but very well said need more ppl not being afraid to admit it,0
sorry you have been treated like that in my experience ive had to be very firm with drs in order to have them listen to me i know my blood pressure increases when i have high anxiety and i still take blood pressure meds and its normal now when my anxiety is under control take a mood journal outlining your moods and anxiety for at least a fortnight and take it to your dr do you have an at home blood pressure machine? i take my bp twice a day or more often if im not feeling right like during extreme anxiety and take that too if you dont have one i know some pharmacies here in australia will take bp for free if none of that works its time to change dr,1
totally use to having extream anxiety with depression and being manic non stop glade i dont have a tail  im always forgetting what im doing and going in circles feels like lol,0
i hate having both anxiety is a constant for me and it always has been depression comes and goes but when i have them both at the same time i feel like a walking contradiction desperate for connection yet i want to be alone and not talk to anyone my body is tired but my mid is tangled with everything that i didnt do and how badly i might have messed up what i did do having both is truly what nightmares are made of i have pushed so many people away over time i go from one extreme to another one minute im crying the next i want to rip peoples heads off i just dont know what to do next,0
its actually like you want to do something anything just to get you out of that dark depressed feelings but you are too anxious to do anything! even if you make some plans you cancel them because you get too anxious and if god forbids if you have social anxiety like me too! i love meeting and talking to people it helps me to feel less depressed and more alive but it like my mind is on constant stress making duty!,0
i feel you i have social anxiety bipolar with more depressive episodes as well as ptsd and regular every freaking day anxiety,1
i hate having both anxiety is a constant for me and it always has been depression comes and goes but when i have them both at the same time i feel like a walking contradiction desperate for connection yet i want to be alone and not talk to anyone my body is tired but my mind is tangled with everything that i didnt do and how badly i might have messed up what i did do having both is truly what nightmares are made of,0
medications can do that but anxieties such as being overwhelmed,1
nope!! i was impatient hospital 4months and my wife came every single day went to counseling read bipolar and anxiety books had two years doing well then this past year was impatient a week she came every day in sickness and in health! you deserve that and youd do the same for him!! (((hugs))),0
turning the tables he steps out on the marriage & tries to guilt you for his infedelity sorry for such a betrayal,1
ive never been married as im 18 but i have been cheated on a few times i can understand how upset you must be right now the best thing to do is try and keep going as best as you can time will heal old wounds x,0
i understand except with me my best friend is the one with the problems she blames me for everything and lashes out at me and lies all the time she has borderline disorder and schizophrenia so i know its not her fault but it still hurts and people left me because i complained too much and had too many problems as someone who has aspergers anxiety and depression so i understand what you are going through,0
i do the same thing but my so called dr does not take me serious so i dont know i take benadryl to sleep but the the nightmares are horrible and the next day i am an a hole and a half im at my wits end myself,0
medication treats the symptoms not the cause yoga meditation really works and i unexpectedly found help in my new misfit watch that tells me what activities i have done including swimming and the sleep pattern i have it helps to see what ive actually done and has made me more relaxed around sleep its as if i am waiting to find out what it was rather than stressing on it at the time daft but it has helped,1
i struggle with this also but for me it goes back and forth of course my husband thinks when i cant sleep i must be manic can you be manic only on that outward sign? i get up usually and sit and read to keep my thoughts on a subject rather my thoughts going around and round music also helps me and a hot bath an hour before bedtime i pray you find relief,1
im struggling with this as well im still getting help for it as its nothing seems to be working cbt helps try reading or listening to music so that you can imagine something in your head then close your eyes and think of that after a while you will hopefully fall asleep - hopefully :) it doesnt work with everyone,1
i take seroquil geodon and depakote for my bp symptoms which includes seeing things and hearing voices that arent real and i get really paranoid i need to sleep or my symptoms get really bad i have been taking ambien and hydroxizine to sleep which has worked great for me i am finally getting my life back together and just got a new job and place to live that will be ready in two weeks unfortunately my dr misread my file and discontinued my ambien which is the only thing that works i am completely out and she wont be in until thursday no one else will write the script because it was discontinued and i had to move out and my new place isnt ready yet so i am sleeping in my car tonight i am exhausted but i cant fall asleep and i am paranoid that something bad will happen if i fall asleep i have no money and i am scared i feel defeated why did my dr have to risk my mental health by changing up my meds when i am the most stable i have ever been and why cant my place be ready now? i am doing my best to change my life great things are happening but now this? why?,1
i use lavender candles bubble bath carpet deodorizer everything and it creates a calmer environment sometimes and help calm me i read somewhere that lavender helps with anxiety and helps calm your brain down and so far ive had a lot of success with it,1
i take lorazepam it helps my anxiety and controls my racing thoughts ive tried sleep meds and anything containing dyphenhydramine it doesnt work i understand your frustration,1
benadryl i tried trazodone made me paranoid and really didnt help with sleep i heard seroquel helps some people,1
i am on prazosine for my ptsd it is helping but stress does work against me what i need to do is start a bed routine where i take my meds about 2 hours before i needs to go to sleep then no tv or stressful or mind activities like games on my phone or tv quiet music and reading and snuggles with my kitty are perfect meditation with 4 - 7 - 8 breathing is one i am working on stopping watching tv is a hard one for me though i know it is tough to shut our minds off mine will not without medication sometimes i will think of a story to tell myself and then just work on it night after night it usually relaxes me and puts me to sleep,1
my psychiatrist prescribed trazadone its in the anti anxiety family it does not help me sleep but i take it and go to bed and what i do sleep is restful peaceful it helps my mind relax,1
me too but start low i have also the do it but i start less than a half because i amin fear about medication every day i have aniety every morning i go to work feel a holl day aniety not good so doc tell me please take it chut you mind bit off and this i need,1
my hubby takes that and he swears by it i need to go on medication to because i suffer from anxiety and depression but am scared of the side affects it has i know i shouldnt but its something that im paranoid about,1
syraquil i use it at night it helps with anxiety and a side effect is drowsiness it doesnt intensify your dreams either,1
yes difficult to set a routine that is suppose to be healthy for stabilization and recovery i hate the uncontrollable crying!,0
hi i was on those i felt they helped me sort of but when i had episodes i felt they were more intense the doctor has taken me off them as i am pregnant but im not coping well at all hes give me others but they dont do anything ive been close to crashing my car into anything signing myself into the hospital its hard to explain to people how your head feels and no one understands ive tried to take a lot of overdoses ive been through so much stress and crap in my life i am surprised im still here! have you tried talking to your loved ones or have they tried talking to you? im always here if you want to chat x,0
hmmm eyti nyebe the struggle is real! ,0
ok but now im stressing out that my brain isnt functioning correctly ,0
this just stresses me out more ugh!,0
stephanie albright johnson memory!! maybe stress just destroyed that neuron,0
probably why i cant remember shit cause i was stressed my whole pregnancy ,1
well then im fucked ive lived in a constant state of stress for over half my life,0
liz broughton may be because your work is stressful?,1
well im screwed! explains the memory and control part! glen lol im such a little stress head ,0
my anxiety has been driving me crazy!!!!!!!!! going on 2 weeks because the dr cut down on my meds i ran out already & my mind is racing 150 miles per minute!!!!!!! i feel horrible i think i should go to the er room ,0
only in front of those that are very close to me not strong enough for anyone else to see me that vulnerable,1
i dont wish this mental illnesses on anyone not even my enemies i feel like i am inside a box barrel and cant get out because i suffocate cant breathe i tell scream and no one can hear me!! its a horrible nightmare that i have major panic attacks,0
i wish i could be more open about my bpd i dont mind talking about anxiety/depression but the bpd stuff makes me sound like a psychotic sociopath tbh,1
i wish this worked for panic attacks i begin puking and sweating and faint before i even know what happened cute meme tho,0
orespecially after the night i had at work last nighttry this: ;),1
oh sweetheart i totally feel like i know how you feel and bless you for your bravery to open up and share as you just did you are a very brave and strong woman because you had the guts to do that and not hide away i know about the hole once youve been it youre always scared of it especially because youve got responsibilities and cant afford to go back because of them its always terrifying because they dont mean to cause stress but they do and some days youre just holding on for dear life to get through and avoid the hole i guess id say if you can find some relief some help so you can take quality time out for yourself to catch your breath and feel refreshed thats very important for you you need real breaks and time for you and your mental well-being you also need to make sure youre getting lots of good quality sleep my friend rest is so important to staving off depression keep in touch!,0
acupuncture was soothing and calming for myself i was told i looked like a different person after a session my pain was lessened and my focus enhanced my body relaxed i was at peace i also used eastern oriental medical herbs and compounds this of course sadly was not covered by insurance chiropractic medicine is also helpful in whole body restoration for myself and is covered by insurance i still take meds for bipolar also the combination of complementary medical interventions are very helpful for me one incident i can relate to you is that unknowingly i had not been taking my tegretol for 3 weeks and ended up in the hospital as my mental health rapidly decompensated until i was nothing but uncontrollably enraged,1
i take various meds of different type i dont view the world of my brain as having one end all and be all my meds that i am on now were not fixing everything i had too many hormonal shifts that were also causing huge bipolar mood swings i couldnt find an oral contraceptive or medication that helped so i switched to doing medical herbs to help control the hormonal shifts i am on 4 different types of actual psychiatric meds as a cocktail and they are realtively low doses i also take xanax if needed i do yoga exercise essential oil therapy have my service dog and do various other things for coping mechanisms honestly when my meds are off i have still found my stability is far better because of all the other things i include in my regime and it often helps me from getting too bad i also dont try to stop certain types of obsessive thoughts and instead direct my obsession onto productive projects i have,1
i am also bipolar 2 with ptsd and anxiety disorders im under the care of a psychiatrist i take remeron trazadone and xanax for anxiety im 53 and have been bipolar my whole life i have taken almost every med out there i also wish you well! please keep me posted on how the 5htp works out! ❤,1
a friend of mine uses that and says it helps her good luck with it  i myself am bipolar 2 and i need a mood stabilizer and something for anxiety  sometimes it takes awhile and some trial and error to find what meds work for you i wish you well ❤,1
thats what im going through im blah and have no motivation the thought of cleaning my house is overwhelming so i do nothing i have shut myself off from friends and family i have severe anxiety so even the thought of talking makes me so nervous so i dont call anyone,0
im feeling the same way its been a long while since ive been this depressed my anxiety level is out of this world been on same meds now for bout 9yrs i know they arent working anymore so its time for a change i cant sleep maybe if i could it would help diagnosed bi- polar 22yrs ago and its been horrible at times over the years i feel so lost and alone right now i hope you get to feeling better i pray i do too,0
im with you the winter was horrible and im trying to be motivated but it just isnt happening all i want to do is sleep ,0
i didnt work for 3 months now did very little over that period but fortunately back over past fortnight be kinder to yourself it is what it is and its horrid but it can pass sometimes it is very little victories listening to a mediation doing a childs crossword listening to your favourite comedy be kind to yourself,1
i also feel this sometimes though like of course im grateful to have these medications but i occasionally get angry and bitter that i cant function without them it seems unfair to have to try so much harder than most just to feel like a person its not that i dislike taking the medicine but rather i am bitter that i even have this problem in the first place and if something ever happens to my medicine i would be a total wreck within a few hours it makes me feel weak and vulnerable idk if maybe this is along the lines of what you were feeling?,0
i feel the same way i stopped taking them been taking pills for depression and anxiety for 20 yr now they still couldnt find the right ones so i have the right to give my organs a break but i feel ya about meds ,1
i wish i had the answer just know youre not alone ive been like this a lot myself the past few months it finally got to where this week i went on fmla / short term disability from my job til june 15 thats been a huge relief right now im trying hard to at least do one thing a day my bipolar "all or nothing" makes me struggle to keep up with housework bcuz i feel like i "have" to do it all in one day and thats too overwhelming my first step right now is trying to tell myself do it lil by lil well see hugs,0
lorasapam is a weak drug  they give xanax for that type of anxiety hun  each nerve pill or drug like that is for different things  zanax is a powerful sensitive and do not ever just stop taking it because this drug can kill you if you withdraw suddenly from it talk to your doctor it takes that anxiety right away,1
sorry to hear that but sounds about right im afraid to go to doctors because im also bipolar and have bad anxiaty  and they will just say ur fine or just boot u out the door i hope u have a good weekend and wish i had the ancwers u need to help ,1
oh dear my friend i feel so badly for you all i can tell you is about me really im prescribed lorazepam and i stagger it in the evening for anxiety i take a mood stabilizer lithium 3x a day and another mood stabilizer at night that is good for anxiety called zonisamide maybe ask your doctor about these drugs because my anxiety is under control good luck!,0
i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when i was just 11 and everyone says to me that i am no depressed just upset  but i just dont want to smile as i have nothing to smile about anymore and am not intrested in the things that i used to be intrested in my behaviour changed when i was just 7 but i didnt think anything of it until i was 11 and then i knew and 24 now still fighting it,0
you are not alone many people suffer from anxiety and depression we feel the same way see a doctor and let them prescribe you meds to take youll feel better,1
i agree you need to see a doctor please get diagnosed there are medications to help you counslers to talk to there is hope there is great amazing things for you take the time to help yourself is there a magical cure for bipolar no i color in adult coloring books and journal to help with my anxiety its ok i felt the same way ssshhhh dont tell anyone because of fear if you share and speak about it the fear hasnt one you are strong you can do this! ,1
thank you all for your help and advice its nice to know there are people in the same position as me maybe when i next meet with my doctor i wont be as nervous to mention it as im clearly not the only one  i never wanted to go to the doctor trying to self diagnose myself because of the stigma attached to mental health but i figured if i just tell my doctor these minor details about myself she can point me in the right direction x,0
please find out if you are bipolar this is very common behavior for someone with bipolar if you have bipolar you can work on a plan to address this behavior you may not have bipolar but if you do you should be addressing it properly instead of treating depression and anxiety exclusively,1
i take trintellix for depression works good took time but i like it and ativan for anxiety and other bipolar meds but those two are really good,1
i flush mine down the toilet then cry about how miserable my life is then im happy 5 mins later lol,0
i use my phone alarm goes off twice a day :) you get the best results out of your medication if you take it on time everyday :),1
i set out all my meds on sundays into a container and have an alarm for each time of day no excuses for me only health,0
they have lids for your med bottles that actually have alarms and remind you to refill you can find them at your local pharmacy,1
the key is routine all phones have alarms i used to use mine as a reminder i now have my routine and i never miss it takes 21 days to create new habits/ routines,1
my ptsd major depressive disorder severe social anxiety and the catastrophic fallout on my total mental and physical health all make me avoid most social sittuations now i have my doctors other supporters a daughter a mom who also suffers and a few solid stable friends but  support like this online is also one of my daily life-supporting measures at this most frightening time,1
i seem to feel im offending people socially and avoid contact making the matter worse,0
seriously i did 3 months and i have been so fine i came off meds im currently doing another 2 months (after a year) to lose the last of it but the 12 months between doses i had 1 episode of hypomania (so not full blown) and no depression with reduced anxiety and thats on no psych meds except occasional valium for anxiety triggers (ptsd),1
i have just finished a months worth and just got prescribed 1 more month and i totally understand how you are feeling it has made my bipolar almost non existent (well it seems like it) no anxiety depression or manic im thinking clearer and everyone in my family and close circle of friends have said i am the best ive been in 13 years and only my mother and sister know im taking duromine its insane i wish there was something we could do to keep it up if you find out a solution let me know please good luck with weight loss and bipolar battles,0
be careful duramine is speed and can increase possibility of mania my psych wont put me on it because of that fact its too risky it shouldnt be used as a psych drug its purely approved for weight loss and not any psych illness id really speak to your psych about it,0
my husband has been prescribed it for weight loss but unfortunately its had side effects hes not the same person anymore hes paranoid angry and hes begun smashing things in our house he had no mental health issues before the medication he thinks im plotting against him and i hate to admit it but im scared he refuses to believe he has a problem the man i love is now a stranger to me im making him come to the doctor with me tomorrow but i suspect hell just keep denying it regardless of what the doctor says please think twice before taking this medication yes youll lose weight but that may not be the only thing you lose ,0
everyone reacts differently to certain meds i did horribly on wellbutrin it made my anxiety worse yet others do great on it,1
as i said weight loss is initially the reason im on it the other effects are just bonuses at this stage im only allowed it three times a week to avoid dependence & resistance,0
just because society has told us that mental illness is a horrible life does not mean it is a death sentence nor should we embrace the labels i hate having to wear my mask but i am striving to become stronger so that i can take it off i am who i am i am not my mental illness,0
this is a core question many ask in the depths of their illness the curse is that whilst the illness is real for the sufferer the reality of the actual world may not be as desperate it does not help that we are surrounded by such a negative media only reporting the bad stuff of life and the world we live in why do public sector broadcasters in the uk or usa not broadcast positive news the uks biggest supporter of those experiencing suicidal feelings - samaratins - would argue that providing time and space for people with such feelings to talk unjudged and explore them can bring new perspective and outlook to move away from the deepest darkest thoughts unfortunately for a very few no relief can be found and suicide provides the ultimate escape from the pain reducing the stigma and taboo that still persists on brain illness needs to be tackled in the uk the nhs does not provide the necessary preventative public health work because the government will not find in this area which is the biggest single health issue affecting us socially and economically as a populace we remain in denial out of fear to open up about this many face their daily struggles in silence and isolation there are alternatives - dare we fight for them?,0
yes we should fight for them here in america in my town our hospital 20yrs ago a doctor told me that here we tend to sweep mental illness under the rug i recently to a razor down my arm and went deep and long ways  it was bad  they stapled it back together they were holding me to send off to a mental unit some where  the nurse told me we dont treat phyic patients here! and if you try and escape we will lock you up in a room well that set me off and i left without notice and was listed as a missing person i had hit bottom once gain  i survived  im 59yrs old my illnesses started in my early 20s  anxiety  depression and now bi polar disorder,1
one because it will not only hurt you but everyone who cares about you for a long time two because if you dont get it right youll probably end up worse off than you are now are you willing to risk it either way? theyre the only reasons i am still here plus the fact death could be worse you never know,0
my daughter is the main reason im still here although i struggle with this questions all the time!,0
because it will not always be agony if you stay strong you will have a day so beautiful it will be worth it i stay strong for those days even though every day is a struggle,0
i am fearfully and wonderfuly made i am me and god loves me,0
its us a struggle as a parent of a child with multiple mental illness the struggle is real and also affects the other siblings in my family but i take it day by day and 1 step at a time with that being said it is beneficial to seek help i have done that with my daughter and it gives her multiple outlets and multiple people she can turn to for help,0
im sorry this is so long but i just posted this yesterday as a wake up call to my husband  i have a rantfor those of you who have a friend or loved one with a mental illness/chemical imbalance let me share with you some thoughts 1 we have real genuine emotionshowever more often than not those emotions are overshadowed and pushed aside when the focus turns to the outburst we may have causedwhile trying to express our emotions 2 the most hurtful belittling thing u can say to someone with depression/bipolar or any other chemical imbalance disorderis" your not really mad/hurt/etcyour just crazy youll be fine in a few days youll get over it" (most of us are well aware we let our crazy show way too muchwe really dont need you to remind us) now that being saidis it fair to youthat you deal with these outbursts and mixed emotions from your friend or loved onenoits noti have no doubt that its hardand painful i have personally put my own family and friends thru hell and back and i would take it all back if i couldi would fix it every wrong or bad impulsive decision ive ever made just to give them some peace every day people like me struggle over every​ single decision we makesecond guessing if we are doing right thing or "just being crazy" (once againwe are awaredont remind us) on good dayswe are even able to evaluate the words that come out of our mouths or what is expressed on fb the point iswe do have real feelingsreal emotionswe get our feelings hurtwe get angryeven when we are fully medicatedby not validating thatall your doing is pushing us awaymaking us doubt ourselves morein my world personallyi cant handle much more of thatmy mind already runs 24/7 just trying to maintain a certain level of normalcy,0
its a real struggle i have good days and then theres those days that seem to never end i also suffer from severe anxiety so when im low im very low but horribly anxious at the same time i want to crawl out of my own skin sometimes on good days theyre awesome and i feel somewhat ok my medication is helping but as we all know theres no cure and medication can only help maintain the illness when im down and depressed i think of the good days and try my best to stay positive by reminding myself that this wont last forever take your medication it does help i know not all meds are for everyone and the process of finding the cocktail that work is agonizing because youre already on edge and arent sure how the medication will work and react to your body its a process but it helps hang in there guys i truly mean it when i say i understand we are not victims we are not crazy we are people who with patience and practice can heal and feel better,0
a constant struggle with myself no meds anymore im getting by  by the grace of god,0
recently i met a woman i really liked adored felt compassion for and respected and the other day she hurt me badly and let me go from my job even by lying to do it i was so hurt for this person was one in a million to me i didnt take her for granted i didnt obsess over her but she was integral in my choice to work there and my happiness there i think we bipolar pick up on certain qualities and characteristics but overlook the reality of how that person can be in the given environment and what we get is not all there is to see we need to be careful,0
yes when i met my last girlfriend i felt obsessed about her shes since left me i still think about her every day and it kills me,0
or whether it will be a debilitating depressive episode or an extreme anxiety episode,1
someone offended me at work when i was able to keep a job at 10 am in the morning i was in a manic episode till 2 am the following morning shaking with pure (irrational) hatred,1
it is more noble to live with your own agony than to transfer it to those that you love it is horrible to say but i am used to the agony i live with everyday so i am better resourced to cope with it due to sheer experience with my own emotion to end my life would take my agony and force it into the lives of those i love and that simply isnt something i am willing to do i can deal with the constant questions whirling around in the dark vortex of despair in my brain but if i were to stop that happening? my mum my girlfriend my friends my colleagues would all be thinking endless thoughts "why didnt we notice it sooner?" "why didnt he trust us enough to talk about how he felt?" "how could we have helped him?" and that kind of rumination is something i wouldnt wish upon my very worst of enemies x,0
i survive by thinking every day is a different day i may wake up happy tomorrow live each day a day at a time and dont pressure yourself xxx,0
because instead of thinking of your pain you need to think of what it would do to your family and friends if you have kids it changes them in ways youll never see because you wont be there however we all know the struggle,0
name of companies: anxiety girls,1
no big emphatic no there is no way when i plunge to low that i could possibly follow this advice not a true representation of how depression/anxiety/bipolar works at all!!!!!!,1
yes i see a psychiatrist and counselor but i still struggle,0
i know the feeling of cutting  i only do it once in a while  i went rock bottom recently and took a razor down my arm deep and long  i had it stapled back together i ment it this time i wanted to die  i have lived with anxiety depression and resently been diagnosed with bi polar these things are no fun let me tell you the meds i take dont seem to work all the time i wish you luck happinessand a long good life,0
talking or texting or emailing your thoughts and feelings like dairy keeping or indeed talking are all good find someone to talk to too if you think people are scared to listen as many are because it is illness they cant see or often understand tell them they are not as half as scared as you are to tell i was so very fortunate during my recent depressive episode to have people around me who listened and did no judge and offered comfort and joy principally my partner the texts and fb messages and messenger messages from people who were not nearest or dearest but who experience of what i was experiencing and were able to tell me because i told them first was a delightfully supportive surprise ignore gender bias  but these may be useful and resource section of ,0
i have a friend i speak with and my husband but he was at work and she asleep and it wasnt an extreme emergency so i didnt want to wake her and my other social media account was very dead so that is why i posted here and then got paranoid lol i am pretty open about my struggles so the more i thought on it the less paranoid i became i am so sorry those around you do not show the support you deserve and need im lucky to have a pretty tight circle around me,0
thats the whole thing stuggling but a hole nother thing when it comes to struggling alone!!!! i wish the stigma of having a mental illness would just disappear what makes me the saddest is people serounding me (closets family ) telling me get over it its your own fault your like this and the best oneits all in your head get a grip sometimes wish they could walk in my shoes for 1 day just 1 dayits utter hell! if they see this post so what all that will be said isooooops there she goes again ,0
most importantly i was struggling and i needed to say that past that what will be will be,0
i am not overly worried as they know i have issues i was a little worried about the cutting part as im not as open about my darkness as i am about my other crazy if people read it so be it i guess i am not as concerned now as i first was thank you again ,0
well i figure you should know its a possibility next time tell them you want it to be anonymous when they share a post of yours its not really paranoia when it comes to social media its a digital age and anything can be found if you dig hard enough or spend enough time looking just being honest if youre worriedmessage the page and ask them to take the post down,0
thank you much i get paranoid easily and that helped immensely,1
i always acted happy and carefree but when i was diagnosed and went for therapy a whole lot of things fell into place a lot of things in my past just made sense i wish i had help when i was young but my mom who suffers of severe depression was to busy to notice i had a total burn out 7 years ago but my loving husband and son has been my rock but my doctors are amazing as well i have been with the same psychiatrist and psycologist all this time and they pull me through many times it took a while to get my meds right but it is fine now i still have manic episodes and have learned that it is okay to ask for help even if it is just a hug if family dont understand it is usually because they are scared that you will blame them get help go to good doctors and then sit and explain what you feel and go through i took my hubby to counselling with me a few times and it helped if you feel alone just check the page there is always someone with loving help and advise,0
you are not alone being diagnosed is the first step dont be afraid to share your true feelings put you first take care of you there is a huge support system out there good luck ,0
i went through the same thing since i was 16 i did research cause i knew the way i thought and the way i acted didnt feel normal to me as i saw everyone around how they were i got diagnosed 2 years ago and i was right that i was bipolarits a scary thingthrough that time my mother would tell me youre not bipolar just cause you look at stuff on the internet and when i got upset she always threatened to put me in the hospital and always called me manic now ever since i was diagnosed she asked questions 1 time and never talked about it since so i feel yougo talk to youre doctor cause if you feel it you might be,0
i would go intricate here but in a nutshell (but feel free to ask or direct messages me) if a particular batch of people wasnt tampering with the reality and offsetting of polarisation in the world and people which is accompanied by severe sociopaths and narcopaths the poles of energies that make us up wouldnt be confused nor would would be in a orchestrated narcissistic world!! alone and isolated one must find solitude and within oneself serendipity and contentment even if no ones innerstands you i found several major puzzle pieces to what is going on and the deeper mechanics that unveil and expand and repair our consciousness mind and body somewhat anywhoo wholeness ♾ listen to what is the matrix by secret energy #np on #soundcloud ,0
living with depression anxiety and whatever label you want to give mei just reached this point of understanding for me i had to go through many many years of meds and therapy that didnt actually fix the problem ive been thinking heavily on this and really found comfort in your post bc this is the first time i saw another person who has this understanding,0
clearly many people who comment here have first hand experience of brian illnesses have a look at the resource page on a developmental web site im creating with contributors below ignore that they are directed at men its just men struggle more to talk about their health and perceived weaknesses see see resource page at and,0
i am incredibly alone and lonely in my psychiatric illnesses of bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder generalized anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder with permanent short-term memory loss since electroconvulsive therapy in 2002 nobody understands all of what i experience i would not wish any of it on anyone i have researched it all i thus know a considerable amount about such illnesses even borderline personality disorder i identity with you,1
well look no further plenty of friends and advice here you say youre going to the doctors youll have quite a bit to say no doubt make sure that before you go you write everything down doesnt matter how trivial some things may seem you can always edit your notes later it is so important being your first visit that you give a good understanding of your situation most of all dont be afraid i know youll be anxious but think of this as the start of your new life i hope everything goes well for you and keep an eye on this page❤❤❤,0
i say that i am not a proffessional but just gotta let that anxiety out go to a place or do it in your house in your room and take a deep breathe and then let it out as a big loud scream that will hopefully help you feel a little bit better then you have got to be strong and bring yourself to looking for friends that are willing to listen and respond to your questions i know this will be hard but it would be good to find a therapist that will actually listen to you and give you her proffesional out put sorry if i mis spelled any of my words me i would rather keep things in than go to a therapist and have them tell me some stupid excersize but like i said you look like you are really suffering,0
i hold my breath when anxiety attacksughhh,1
tricia leanne cordell because my anxiety bothers you :) i like this article!,1
very true with people that have depression/anxiety,1
according to my husband depression and anxiety are things people allow themselves to have and they should just not allow themselves to get that way it is just a cop out to get out of things,0
ca n relate big time panic station everyone get to your panic stations ,0
its strange how all my anxiety just disappears when i go high (i have bipolar btw if anybody reads this and thinks im on illicit drugs!!!),0
hey my partner is like you he has bipolar as well as depression and anxiety he often in his lows gets drunk for long periods of time and says he doesnt want to be together and the next day says he loves me then says doesnt want to be together etc what should i believe that he loves me or that he doesnt want the relationship,0
i thought i have outgrown my anxiety but i guess i was wrong,1
a lot of these are on point i relate the most to replaying conversations wondering if i did something wrong when someone doesnt respond right away beating myself up constantly and fear of mistakes my anxiety in my opinion is the one thing out of 2 things ive been diagnosed with that i just cannot get a handle on at all therapy has helped my depression and self harming with added meds but i just cant get the thoughts of being a massive failure and screw up to stop that and the suicidal ideation constant thoughts of "everyone would be better without me" and "im replaceable",1
i get how u both feel because i do as well people with anxiety rly need people around them that try to help them because i have felt the same way about everyone would be better off without me from time to time and its hard because if you honestly dont have it you dont understand how it makes us feel they only think they know,0
we should i feel very alone in this process of trying to get better most of the time i cant seem to find many that understand and cant shake the stigma associated with depression mostly,0
i could have just written that scary i feel the exact same thing we should talk,0
living with mental illness please check out my blog theres much insight on my struggles and ways to cope (=,0
13 and 9 are daily struggles,0
you might not realize it but through the everyday struggles you endure i see a brave and strong woman who thinks shes on this journey alone shes not even when were not together im mentally by your side holding your hand and whispering i believe in you love you your #1 fan,0
on the verge of a nervous breakdown but forced to go to work and forbidden to take a day off for 6 months,1
anxiety squad assemble! i swear some days i dont get out of bed unless i literally have to (food coffee toilet etc) and one thing going wrong can break my happy mood like a pin on a balloon,0
yep anxiety is not stress it pisses me off too,0
therapy helps sometimes you may go through a few therapists til you find the right fit for you i only take 20mg of lamictal and 10mg of nortriptyline which im prescribed for a nerve in my face but it also works for depression which i have severely right now it is at bay which im greatful for if you believe in god you can talk to him that has helped me alot but everyone is different i have social anxiety but not taking anything for it right now,1
along with meds i suggest adding some vitamins and minerals i struggled with severe depression for years and feel like vitamin b 12 saved my life it can be found it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin levels checked and get injections some people like me dont absorb b12 correctly so injections are the only method that works for me i also recently started taking magnesium tablets which have greatly reduced my anxiety i hope things get better for you very soon ,1
let her know that there are several people in this world who care for their loved ones  she/ he just needs to open up about herself to them and i m pretty much sure that they will be patient listenre and they will listen to watever that person has to say and i say so because a month ago i had met someone with same thing i wont say it as a disorder because it seems like a disease but i feel it is not so everyone has flaws and no one is perfect and their is someoe to accept u in that way  i m someone who is filled with completely trust issues and i dont trust even myself but i m trying to change just because of that one person who came in my life as achange i wanted to be around with her everytime but i lost her cause she found someone else  and the only reason i lost her was because someone else was a better listener and compassionate towards her if u r having this anxiety depression then let me tell u accept it as a fact and wear it like an armour so that no one in this world could hurt u again and agin by saying that u have a disease its a rare thing to have  i have only came across one person and she is almost as close to me as like my mother  but i believe she is unique as she makes people feel special and so i believe u r asweel  people are there to care for u and talk to  its 2 o clock in the night and i m still awake i havent slept in last 4 days  and it always happens to me that i suffer from insomnia after every fortnight  i have lost my lullaby so if u have someone who loves u and cares for u then just dont loose them and talk to them cause u cant bear the pain of loosing the only lullaby,0
your meds may need to be adjusted i am treated for bipolar with anxiety at one polarity and depression at the other i take two kinds of mood stabilizers one an atypical zonisamide that emphasizes anxiety at night400mg standard dose then lithium 300mg slow release 3x a day then atypical ziprasidone at night for sleep i have a benzo as needed for anxiety at nighttime this combination works well for me,1
i have had depression and anxiety from about 12years oldalthough my depression has never been too severe at times it has defined me now i try to be in charge of it and quite a lot of the days kit works you can still have bad daysjust try to go with it as tomorrow really is another day you will get there seek all the help you can get from your gp and psychological therapies you will get to a better place all the best,1
you definitely need some different meds and some stronger doses to stop the monkey gym thats going on inside your head driving you to chaos the noise in your head needs to be turned way down and medicine can do that i suggest slow release lithium and an atypical anti psychotic like ziprasidone another great mood stabilizer is zonisamide which has an active element for anxiety zoloft taken in the morning at a low dose with this combination is like a good sprinkle of salt for depression too much and it can cause depression or mania but 25mg is good finally counseling!,1
if things dont get better look at the meds im now on i use to take effexor but ultimately it did not work for me i would really like to to see you try a mood stabilizer and lithium is the best although the name sounds harsh i know its been such a great for me dealing with depression and anxiety good luck honey!,1
thank you! the meds were just adjusted i take effexor rx 225mg clomipramine 50mg i also have klonapin and hydroxozine for anxiety and panic attacks and i am seeing a new therapist tomorrow will he my third visit,1
thanks for sharing our story!! everyone please feel free to share our story this was avoidable for our daughter our daughter is 12 and has been stable we begged and pleaded with our property management to do the right thing and to take our daughters mental health into consideration its so important to have a stable and structured environment for her 22 days being in a hotel or with family with hotels were booked is far from the life we have provided for our kids especially our daughter who needs this lifestyle to make her safe,0
only been on it for 2mths but no probs with sweating is shaking as in hands legs or head an issue for anyone as this has been a huge problem for me at the moment,0
when my hands get sweaty its the first sign along with shaking of a panic attack but this started way before i started effexor i havent noticed any worse sweating after starting it,1
there is so much help out there so by taking the first step and asking for it you have started on a journey of hope from personal experience i know its not a short journey but the doctors/ psychiatrists know how to help you so dont feel anxious about meeting them you dont have to deal with this alone so all the best,1
i agree that you need to see a psychiatrist and try medications i suggest adding some vitamins and minerals as well i struggled with severe depression for years and feel like vitamin b 12 saved my life it can be found it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin levels checked and get injections some people like me dont absorb b12 correctly so injections are the only method that works for me i also recently started taking magnesium tablets which have greatly reduced my anxiety i hope things get better for you very soon ,1
panic disorder is on the dsm and needs immediate treatment as does self harm feelings of suicide are very serious and you need to find and emergency room psych ward right away and tell them youre a harm to yourself and check yourself in and they will refer you later to a proper psychiatrist right now you need a higher level of care go get it dear!,1
you need to see a dr to get referred to a psychiatrist and therapist you cant deal with this all on your own look up mindfulness it is great for dealing with anxiety although you will probably have trouble doing it yourself to start with but it might be worth checking if out while you wait to see your specialist,1
hi suffered 2 years with the exact same thing the dr told me i had gad its takes time  i didnt take any meds i was to scared  time healed me,1
i just went through this my mania was so high it was causing anxiety attacks luckily new dr recognized this put me on seroquel its been a godsend,1
i find if you have a panic attack it normally happens when you start focusing on yourself the fear if you have a fidget toy play a game in your phone and shift your focus i find it not as bad as for the rest finding balance with your doctors needs and therapy is definitely,1
first thing im so sorry you have to go though this try going to a different dr one for mental anxiety and depression or try councilling(or both) you need help in dealing with this with the right help you can learn some skills to cope with this!!!! your reaching out is a good thing and a good sign that you want helpjust know you are loved and there is people on your sidegood luck to you and let us know how things are working out it will be all right ❤,1
thx ronnie! ive just got a lot on my plate my son was shot in 2007 (he survived thank god!) and i got laid off my job cuz i was spending too much time at the hospital depression & anxiety kicked in and i was in pain 24/7 come to find out i have fibromyalgia osteoarthritis and a list of a dozen things wrong  i need teeth lolyou gotta laughor cry and cant afford shit on disability im trying to be positive and happy but its a daily challenge just some background im trying and focusing on being thankful for the good,0

i get paralyzed i seriously cant move or think can barely speak totally weird does anyone else have anxiety attacks that manifest like this?,0
why do you keep posting these?! support page? turning into a shame page tbh!!,1
come on guys for a lot of us this is not always a choice :-/ this is a pretty blamey/shamey sort of meme,0
you just literally posted this on a page devoted to illnesses that sometimes take away from (or at least inhibit) the sufferers ability to choose this can we get some things on this page that are actually helpful and informative?,1
shes in a bad place right now and probably terrified as well the doctors will help her and then shell be a lot more understanding,1
welcome to the club it is really hard when our loved ones are severely mentally ill we feel like we are getting ill too because of the stress of it i have a hard time with communication when my loved one is getting more ill also there is a lot you can read online and there are some good books written also it was hard for me to learn not to challenge delusions it is hard to realize that they are ill and to not take their anger personally when i was a child we had to get my mother to the hospital but we always put it off as long as possible hoping unrealistically that she would get some sleep and feel better my mother would get manic after she was in the hospital for a while she would say " why didnt you get me here sooner?" but when she was so sick she did not want to go hang on to the fact that she will be feeling better soon although it may be a while these days they are required to go to groups in the hospital and they do get to think about mental health and how to stay healthy mentally you can go to a support group held by nami for families that may help you,0
first of all- you are amazing - you did the best u could at the time and her health was your main concern/priority thats love - period nobody likes inpatient care especially mental health but she needed you and you showed up and stepped up dont doubt yourself on that decision im so sorry she is suffering and you are feeling helpless find a good counselor for you similar to aa people who love those with mental illness need support too- and thatll help u to feel more confident about caring for her bipolar is a bitch excuse the language but its seriously horrid be there for hugs hold her when shes panicking and help her breathe slower while u hold her remind her that its ok to stay in bed or "check out" when overwhelmed shes blessed to have u,0
good that you are supporting her but before that please please try to find out the reason why it all started whats all is going in back of her mind which is troubling her she might be hesitant to share it easily but u have to find out that rather going for medications i know it is necessary but try to figure out the reasons first as no one is born with this illness ,1
give her space and love keeping a watchful eye on her do the things you would do yard workhandling the vehicles throw in "i love you" a few times but not constantly one of them will get in ask her if she wants to go out if only for a walk dont get mad when and if she doesnt we dont want pressured of made to feel evil and ignorant i lost my daughters dad that way he hovered so much i could not keep a thought if i tried bipolar we have enough going on i our heads to deal with than to be made a monster good luck truly,0
i want to start by telling you i appreciate you wanting to understand better i have lived with it for over 30 years forcing my husband to " live with it also" like you he educated himself the thing i want to tell you most is we are uncurable we are not crazy its not all in our heads and how can we make some one else understand what we dont for me it was finding the right set of medication ( this took years) continual therapy because the meds only help " manage" the symptoms and even with all this help i still have episodes my husband knows he cant fix it but he has learned to communicate with me and when not to sometimes we want to be held sometimes we want to be left alone sometimes when we lose control we need someone to intervene you did the right thing i am betting when your wife slips into a sane moment she will agree its not that we want to die its that we just want these overwhelming feelings to stop read research literature because the better you understand the better her support team to a manageable life,0
first off she is very lucky to have someone who is so supportive so give yourself credit for that! i have bipolar and depression and on my bad days some times my spouse has difficulty handling it or knowing the right things to do so i understand (from how he has explained it) how you are feeling i cant speak for everyone as everyone is different but for me the whole pushing everyone away is somethibg that happens to me a lot especially during episodes i dont want anyone near me i have trouble feeling connected to anything or anyone including my spouse for me what means a lot to me is that he is supportive as well and doesnt give up on me even when i want him to sometimes even if i want to reach out and talk i cant bring myself to do it so i shut everyone out instead when im in that state of mind im certain that i am a burden to everyone and that everyone will give up on me reassurance is something i need a lot i would say just make sure that she knows that you are there with her that she s not alone and that you love her and that you will be there beside her while she gets through this she may try to push you away and i would imagine its not an easy thing to feel but dont take it to heart its her illness talking not her sometimes the illnesses can take control of us i can think of countless times when i am pushing my spouse away or being mean so he will go away but on the inside i want nothing more than to be with him but i cant bring myself to say those words or to drop that wall that i have up being stuck inside yourself is scary you are doing the right thing by being there for her and she will come out of this! ❤,0
her saying she hates you or the anger thats not her speaking thats the illness it may not seem like it now but things will get better shes very lucky to have your support and you trying to understand what shes going through i must say you are awesome and you should be so proud of yourself for taking these steps like some of the others have said just dont forget to take care of yourself as well you cant be there for orders if you are tired rundown or overwhelmed,0
you have done the right thing and she will understand in time when she is on the correct meds bless you and your family its a battle but stick together and you will cope xx above all talk to anyone you can and dont be afraid of taking help and advise much love to you xx,0
i have bipolar and depression and anxiety and ptsd its one hell of a roller coaster even with meds i feel like im in a nightmare be there for her let her know shes not alone and that she is loved good luck to u sir i hope things get better,0
i hate panic attack,0
scary veryall above,0
i think it is hard for others to understand what it really feels like they also are very unsure about what they can do i have been anxious and have had panicky feelings for several days now and i am not sure what helps i breathe count look around the room use mindfulness but it is still present and disturbing if someone else is with me it helps be present with person is very important validating that it must be difficult is also important,0
what helps? - being in a safe place feeling loved having family or friends who want nothing arent telling you what to do and cause no stress :),0
i had my first panic attack at work a while ago and my manager said to me to take it as a lesson learned she and i have not had same relationship since,1
i had art therapy sessions in rehab and out patient it only made me stress more i never got how coloring is stress relief,0
same! it stresses me way out,0
im an impatient perfectionist and the irony is in my life i am creative interior design especially but my "doing" skills lack i would rather be the person with the idea of what the picture should be for others to color!,0
ive been hanging serios anxiety lately and its the only way i list weight itseems like i just keep gaining sucks,0
my weight goes up and down significantly it is horrible but i feel better because i am stabilized and that is essential to live,0
cannabis is a game changer(mood swingsanxiety)its an all time winnerif you can afford or grow itsynthetic meds are just making me sickerwe are all differentresults may vary,1
it will only lead to psychotics symptoms if you already have themperiodyou wont become sick from this medicationfor the question"any mood stabilizer meds for bipolar that doesnt cause weight gain and acnee"i just answer the question based on my experienceplease get some facts about cannabis and its effects on individualsstrains and thccbd levels,1
but it can also lead to psychotic symptoms and thats a scary thing so i wouldnt advice what you are suggesting,1

went do people who dont believe get so upset with people who do? i dont understand how if he isnt real how does it hurt you? smh i believe as others and our prayers shouldnt effect you,0
i dont agree with you in the early years of my illness i did a lot of praying and i dont believe jesus was listening i did a lot of struggling and i found my own way,0
i was on it for 15 years got really run down during the summer and ended up with toxicity it was good until then im a bit too nervous to go back on it now,0
i knew it my psych is tapering me off of lithium to change my bipolar meds now im nervous bc lithium changed my life in 02 thank you for your feedback ,1
hey i hear you! i suffer from bipolar& it sucks just hang in there it will get better i know it may be hard but just remember that there are people that do care dont be afraid to ask for help please talk to someone,1
i absolutely understandnot a day goes by that its not in my thoughts but is there a sure foolproof way that worksthat scares me,0
get any help you can ive been there (many times) and you cannot do this alone my thoughts and prayers are with you and everyone else experiencing these terrifying feelings and behaviors it is not you it is the disease,0
stay away for the triggers that cause you to be overwhelmed,1
daylight savings seems to trigger mine or going off my meds i miss it too but am too scared of what will happen,1
i am diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and i only experience hypomania -but i tell you what-that list is me all over-except for time being irrelevant ( i am very time obsessive) and having no fear of death oh i also obsess about getting the right amount of sleep i love my sleep and freak out if i dont get enough,1
robin you are so very welcome and yes it does help when some people happen to be on the same page to know ones struggles i call it a rollercoaster that is how i describe my bi polar like have you ever thought and run the name bi polar over in yr mind and what it means to be bi polar i say different but hey we cant change the hand we were dealt we must continue the fight and be so strong and keep our chin up cause we are very special individuals robin *,0
a low dose of trileptal really helped with this its a great mood stabilizer and helps with obsessive thoughts,1
i got my pet therapy note from my phsyciatrist and gave it to my landloard as my apt company doesnt allow pets but i live in maine so the rules might different where you live :) i dont know what i would do without my lexi!! she definately helps with my anxiety bipolar and ptsd,1
ive been looking for the same bc of my anxiety and ptsd,1
omgim so glad you guys are ok or at least still fighting! i was so worried about you i saw your post last week and was terrified for you and your child i felt completely helpless im glad you followed through and did go in like you said you would but i am still very concerned about you please dont give up you have perfect strangers caring about you so you must try to care about yourself you can pm any time you want to talk i know this is the crazy leading the crazy but the crazies are the only ones that understand lol please hang in there also continue to be a good mom continue to take good care of your child you are both special❤,0
i cant even describe to you how much i understand hospital visits oding stopping meds altogether giving up on yourself ive been through all of that too i dont know if i have any advice for you as im still struggling but i just want you to know that you arent alone hun <3,0
the anxiousness when having to eat in front of others wow! ive had this problem for years! just didnt realise it was an actual symptom seriously didnt know it was so bad i could eat in front of family really struggled hated eating out still do but ive overcome it a hell of a lot i even found it difficult to eat in front of my boyfriend,0
i have been like that for over 30 years and i thought i was the only one who hates eating out i get so panicy,0
and thats how it is! "call your person" - means that the patient calls a trusted mental health case manager a family caregiver a peer support phone line or radio station etcpeople with bid find it very hard to be alone with their own intrusive fast anxious thoughts or with their sad and angry thoughtsso they like to reach out and get help and some reality testing from that "person" hope this helps!,0
thank you you lovely people! im at a stage of being scared to say any more to anyone especially family and friends i feel very alone still fed up to be honest its making me angry sitting here in this shell of what i used to call home thats life its shit ill just have to deal with it!!,0
so many of us on this page do understand the reality is when you suffer with thoughts like this thesethoughts lie to you everything is not falling apart you just feel like its falling apart tomorrow the sun will rise the only secret to continuing on is continuing on dont be afraid to reach out for help we are rooting for you and im praying for you right now tomorrow will be better,0
this is a hard question i have extra weight from the drugs - my shape changed - i got that buddha belly - and always had a fairly lean mid section it was the drugs now if i wanted to lose weight i would eat high protein and veges do weights of high reps and low weight and 30 min of cardio 4x a week i would eat protein or a protein shake for breakfast total day cals would not go over 1000 thats my best advice to you plus a multivitamin and fishoil,0
we can all understand because the battles we fight are the samejust multiplied infinitely for each of us we see the dawn and feel powerful yet minutes later are worried about the dusksuch is our beauty and our curse a new person is wonderful until they wish to become close a rain cloud the harbinger of life and moments later a torrent which washes our self awayalways we are both life and death light and dark heaven and helland we can never escapeyet we are the most joyful beings in the universe :),0
for god sakes stay away from abilify! it does permanent nerve damage talk to your doctor about the sweating sometimes changing the dosage or adding another anti anxiety drug can help the most important part is to talk to your doctor and make sure hes listening to you not just pushing pills at you,1
i am on cilift it makes my hair fall out and puck up wight but it helps me deal with my depression and anxiety so its really minor issues,1
all medication has side effects no matter what u take u have to just think are they worth the side effects for the relief u get i deal with medications all day long an no matter what u take there is a risk anyone who tells u other wise is a lier all drs and chemists will tell u there is no medication available that does not have a side effect of taking it,1
you need to grin and bare my dear if you want to feel better sweating isnt the least of your worries,0
i was in wellbutrin and it was terrible side effects include enhancing your anxiety which is what happened to me i switched to effexor and im finally feeling better after years of playing russian roulette with pills having said that everyone is different and you have to trust your doctor and keep trying to find out what meds work for you!,1
imipramine has done wonders for both my depression and anxiety the only side affect i really have is that it makes me extremely tired and nauseous sometimes so i just take it at bedtime,1
everyone reacts differently i didnt get acne with prozac but i did have excessive hunger and increased irritability and hostility,0
wellbutrin is well known for increasing anxiety if you have it already it didnt work well for me at all but everyone us different,1
unless you are unlucky and get the high blood pressure,1
theres a strain called acapulco gold very low in thc (what gives you the head high) and high in cbd (no head high tons of medical benefits) again theres no magical medicine that works for us all but i found mine,1
because it helps most if not all my symptoms from bipolar and adhd and as more and more data and research surfaces its showing to be a lot safer and much less side effects then pretty much anything from the pharmacy i still take lithium and adderall but smoking keeps me happy and functioning the psycho active properties stimulate my brain during depressivecycles but it also keeps me pretty calm and clear headed when i get manic if im having a panic attack/break hitting a bowl will either pull me completely out of it or bring me down enough that my other coping mechanisms can now be used effectively as for the adhd it really controls the impulsive thoughts and lets me get really into a paper im writing or a song im learning on piano rather then constantly needing new stimuli and moving on after 5 minutes,1
have then check your t4 level thyroid function test even if thyroid normal the t4 level can be low on low side normal and triggers night mares and night terrors,0
i honestly think its going to be a struggle to find one that doesnt have at least one of those side affects listed each person is different so will process medications differently speak to your doctor for advice but go with the one thats side affects are most manageable for you most importantly the ones that work for your condition ~vw~,1
hi katie what have you tried so far? i struggle at times my concentration isnt usually good when im like that and go from one thing to another i keep lots of things in my handbag to fiddle with i colour im having a go at journaling including a mood tracker i create upbeat play lists for the day time meditation ones for the evening and if all else fails i try to sleep i hope you are okay the most important thing whatever happens is to be safe if you find you cant control your urges please visit your emergency room ~vw~,0
nothing is bad everything is manageable sweetie you need a med that kills two birds with one stone preferably and the best and proven on the market is lithium its a mood stabilizer i also take zonisamide for depression but it has an edge for anxiety to it i do that at night ask your doctor,1
hi alisha sorry you have been feeling depressed how long has this been going on for you and have you been prescribed any medication? the symptoms of depression can be managed but you may benefit from some counselling to talk through the cause and to help you explore some coping mechanisms for your social anxiety these things take time so dont put any pressure on yourself to feel better over night as there isnt a quick fix i hope this helps ~vw~,1
its hard im struggling too the best i can say is hang in there - they keep telling me itll get better good luck (and yes i have a psychiatrist and psychologist),0
hang in there my sons father takes 60mg cymbalta every morning and has done for years he takes protein shake in the morning which gives him energy ⚡ try that its a good drug,1
people do make me irritable on those days i just try to avoid contact speak only when i have to,0
no its not ive been diagnosed with depression anxiety and paranoia what help you getting for it? i find cbt seems good im getting apps booked in to see the local mh team to sort this out google cbt and what it is this might help you as well as medication? if youre taking anything,1
it happens to me all the time i shake all over legs hands and head basically head to toe i feel it coming on and then struggle to get it to stop try clearing your mind although i know its hard to then take slow deep breathes and try to relax this has helped me,0
i have sort of experienced this not sure if its what you are but it feels like a mini seizure but not intense or anything i think it just may be from my nervousness and being tense for a long period of time it also does it when i lie down after being upset or feeling anxiety its frustrating,1
hi vanessa its not something ive experienced myself it could be a nervousness/anxiety reaction like hands shaking or trembling legs although it is something you should mention to your doctor just so they can rule out any other cause if nothing else is causing it your therapist may be able to suggest something to help ~vw~,1
what is the medicines for anxiety!,1
what are the causes of anxiety!,1
between those two pictures is how i discribe anxiety or what anxiety is like for me,1
when you constantly worry about things and feel as if you things are out of control ~sandi~,0
what are the symthoms of anxiety,1
is a lot of different medications to treat anxiety is best to ask your doctor~sandi~,1
im sorry for everyone that is suffering or suffered and beat it its horrible somedays for sure but youre not alone ive been problematic since around 22 yrs old i often think about killing myself somedays i think about how hard it would be on certain people then other days (the ones that are really scary mentally) are the days when i think it would be so easy right now like it wouldnt bother me at all almost like i want to mess with death it sounds really stupid but im trying to be honest i admire all of the tattoos love to you all,0
some great advice here there are times in life that we can cope with our anxiety because we strategically avoid situations that trigger said anxiety you have obviously reached a point where this is now not working for you please take the advice given so far and visit a psychiatrist for some help your doctor should be able to refer you or make a recommendation ~vw~,1
a good psyc dr can help as well as a tharapist i would find some right away its hard to treat anxiety  im on 6 meds for bipolar one but my anxiety is really bad ,1
when anxiety goes untreated and gets worse the next stage is paranoia you seem to be exhibiting some signs get into a psychiatrist quickly and get treatment honey,1
i was very much the same i thought i was getting better but i avoided things maintained a very very strict control on myself and when things got so overwhelming i just about lost it i got so depressed i couldnt control mood swings i realized i had no quality of life and i needed help and no was going to do that but me i keep looking till i found a dr i liked and listened to me that understood it wasnt am about the meds and let me try alternatives until i realized they really werent helping and when i was ready i started on meds its taken awhile to find some that work but im getting better having someone to talk to like a psychiatrist that again you really like and can eventually open up to really helped me having the right team and positive things to focus on even when things get bad makes a world of difference,1
i agree time to go to a doctor i would also suggest its time to see a therapist as they will be able to teach you the skills and techniques you need to manage your anxiety and depression as medication alone will not cure you,1
time to go to the doctor this is long overdue i suspect part of your anxiety is the isolation as well anxiety depression is a very isolating place to be you must phone the doctor today and try and get an appointment today in my opinion i would regard your appointment is an emergency make sure you do it it will lift the weight off your shoulders ,1
with depression and anxiety i relate to this,1
i dont feel these things life since a very young girl has always been a constant struggle for me in some form or another ive never been in the normal range but could mix with them the job part can be the most trying due to my meds giving me some bad days but i dont regret me how could i?,0
i take lexapro for my depression/anxiety only side effects i have are the bad days when i forget to take it,1
yes im currently taking for bipolar mixed i was previously taking it as a heart medication was hospitalized for bipolar and then restarted on propranolol i believe it helps with the anxiety that physically manifests into an abnormal heart arrhythmia one can be connected to the other,1
i take 40 mg every morning im definitely handling stressful situations a little better,0
ive taken it for years def helps me i cant manage my anxiety without it ,1
i took it for high blood pressure it made me sweat profusely i would sweat just sitting i finally told my doctor i didnt want to take it anymore,1
it seems to be helping my anxiety to the point of im even sleeping better racing thoughts are even slowed down not 100% all the time but definitely seeing a difference,1
does dampen down my physical symptoms of anxiety especially rapid and pounding heart,1
i took it but only for the shakes i got from my anxiety it didnt do anything other than stop my tremors,1
this is the truest statement ! people think depression is a joke or something that a bowl of ice cream can cheer you up its not ive dealt with depression my entire life when my dad died it was horrible & now i lost my childhood home & i just want to die i want to throw in the towel & quit depression is so hard to deal with ,0
omy yes i cant hold my arms over my head or up at all for too long i had to buy a wig not only due to hair lossrelated to stressbut because i just cant do my hair any longer without feeling so dizzy ill pass out i just dont even bother anymore,0
you need to see your doctor i get like that when i have too much lithium in my blood which can be dangerous or just by taking some antipsychotics the head shaking also combined with an uncontrollable jaw ive found a balance of lithium and my antipsychotic olanzapine so i dont get it much any more its something that you shouldnt have to put up with im not saying thats what you have just my experience i hope it helps,1
while you love your boyfriend he is overwhelmed because of his childhood issues his parents and their attitude to you his finances and fatherhood and hes young i really think your emotions are best taken care of by an expert who can properly help you anyway this is important for your son that you get the help you need sweetie,1
i think the relationship sounds like it could be good for the both of you as life is hard on all of us he might himself have mental health issues if nothing else it sounds as if his mom and stepdad are making it very hard on him to make his own decision and if you add that same pressure on him he might be in a type of stasis where he would rather not decide one way or another although he should be more helpful when you are upset who knows what he might be feeling or thinking at that moment it is up to you to decide if that kind of treatment is acceptable in your life and you alone if you love something let it go if it comes back then it was meant to be as for what you can do for you is focus on you and your son dont allow anyone to discount your emotions about the fire that kind of event is very tough and you never get over them but you can get to a point where you are at ease with the memory i try to think different about those situations like"i made it out and got me and my child to safety obviously i can handle my shit! im awesome and strong!" therapy is good for situations like this you get a different view on the things going on in your life you also have a safe place to vent and can get more out than what you just shared with us just remember that many here care enough to try and give you something to go on some kind of advice that hopefully will help and ease your pain even though its facebook and you cant feel our hands on your back to console you in your time of need we all do care about you and very much,0
yes i agree he is incapable of being a good support to you you need to go to the doctors immediately and get on bipolar/depression/anxiety medicine you also need to be strong for your son and do yourself a huge favor-quit seeing your sons father immediately when you have been on your medication for 6-8 weeks and can make a sound decision talk to him about seeing your son you and your sons well being should always come first trust me when i say that your son sees the stress you carry and could have a negative effect on him it happened to me with my daughter until i straightened myself out if you do need a shoulder please inbox me i will not judge you but i will not lie to appease to either im a straight shooter i have everything you have and i have dealt with it my entire life i am not a doctor so i wont give you medical advice except make a drs appt asap michelle,1
it is so hard to make yourself not feel guilty but to help others you must take care of yourself,0
i also have bipolar and adhd i take ritilan lithium and serequol by 3-4pm im the same upset & angry ive been thinking its the ritilan but without it i have zero focus memory & concentration tried taking an extra dose of ritilan at 3pm but then my mind wont shut off at bed time and disturbed sleep makes me manic its all a vicious cycle ,1
im bipolar 1 but also diagnosed with ptsd anxiety ocd and adhd i have yet to find anything that works for me adderall helped my adhd by allowing me to better focus but gave me the jitters triggering anxiety issues im so over it! there are so many different medications out there but finding the right one is never-ending especially for those of us that suffer from more than on disorder because then its about never-ending combinations exhausted,1
hello i have the same diagnosis as you i like vyvanse from morning until about 5pm and then i get shaky and a bit agitated i have to take 2mg of lorazapem which is a benzodiazapines it immediately takes the edge off for my bipolar i take lithium slow release capsules 300mg 3x a day and 400mg zonisamide at night which is a mood stabilizer with an edge for anxiety i hope this helps you good luck!,1
anxiety meditation d counselling/ therapy and hypnotherapy is susceptible to it medication if that helps but no substitute for good psychiatric - not gp - assessment cbt from a counsellor/therapist might help too,1
he needs a psychiatrist and a counsellor too but more importantly he needs himself to be less worried about his illness he is not alone there are many like him things gets ok soon or later and if he has you by his side thats enough to get the hell out of this shit,0
i have severe anxiety panic disorder extreme anxiety to the point i cant eat everyday and i will not step outside the lightest foundation is too dark for me lol havent left the home in 1 year severe depression severe anxietyim slowly working on it with my doctor in a bad way atm but hopefully it will ease i hope the same for your bf its horrendous to live with absolute nightmare,1
for several months l have battled the onslaught of complex post tramatic stress disorder (comlpex as trauma has been a reoccurring theme throughout my life i strongly identify with what you have to face day in day outl am a believer in compliance with meds however double locking doors and closed shutters seemed to just exaserbate the fear of the feari suggest you talk to your dr about having "graded exposure"therapyl am pleased to say its working for me and has opened up a different way of life l can literally smell the roses and feel hope!,0
i got hit by a car and got ptsd and anxiety as a result its hard going out some days but i stick to a routine and it makes it easier to out certain places i push myself occasionally as long as i have my phone to tell me where to go play games etc the main thing about going out is keep their mind off of the things that create the anxiety and of course if the needs arent working back to the drawing board and try again talk therapy works great as well,1
my agoraphobia is similar to your husbands fear level i take effexor and rexulti they help me stay present and unafraid most of the time your husband should absolutely talk to a psychiatrist about panic disorder and any signs of ptsd or c-ptsd,1
please dont smoke weed your paranoia would go through the roof xx this is from someone who knows,0
it depends on the weed i think i have social anxiety and a severe anxiety disorder and i notice when ive smoked it my anxiety has gone down,0
he needs to see both a psychiatrist and a therapist he should be doing cognitive behavioral therapy with the therapist the most likely drug that would help him is effexor which treats both depression and anxiety,1
im not a doctor but im treated directly for maintenance high-level ⚡anxiety i take lithium and zonisamide and lorazepam which is a benzo please get him to a proper psychiatrist! anxiety is horrible,1
i lived in my bedroom for three years because of anxiety for almost a year now ive been taking vybrid xanax and 5htp it has been working so well i actually volunteer three days a week now i only use the xanax in worse case scenarios i still primarily hang out in my bedroom but little steps go a long way! good luck,1
i deal for a jear with high leveloff anxiety my doc tell me take xanax but i have the taken high doses :( and i dont whant it pfff,1
i deal for a jear with high leveloff anxiety my doc tell me take xanax but i have the taken high doses :( and i dont whant it pfff,1
im sorry to hear what you are both going through i take sertraline and venlafaxine to combat my illness and on whole they work but i do get periods of darkness as someone who has battled depression and anxiety for over 25 years i have started to try and occupy my mind does he have anything that he enjoys doing? i have found photography a good outlet and also music im terrible but ive started to teach myself the guitar it helps me i wish you all the best ☺,1
and mixed with the heart project the heart colors are for suicide self-harm anxiety depression ocd and bulimia,1
awww arlene im just a call away dont ever hesitate we can have a blether over a cuppa xx,0
im fearful of my future mostly due to my inability to work (due to mental illness) and lack of money and social connections i feel so lonely just reaching out i know its a shot in the dark,0
shakir,0
how ive been feeling but i know im going through it all to make me stronger my heart had melted again for a while so far m afraid of going back to the ice maiden again but i cant control that if it does guess thats just another part of me dying!,0
i have a daughter 2 granddaughters 1 adhd grandson 5 nieces we are all bipolar its so very hard to live a life of bipolar illness no one understands what you go through each day as a bipolar person i do not know what to expect from myself each day i wake up i hide my feelings most of the time so no one worried about me id go to take a shower so i could hide my feelings so many other things i do! if everyone could just try to understand who i really am! no matter how much im loved i feel unloved most of the time!,0
i dont know what i think of that we all want desperately to be understood,0
i have anxiety and depression and my diagnosis is bipolar largely because of these two polarities if you are acting 180 degrees out of character you can suspect manic behavior,0
it could be a hormone imbalance but it could just as easily be that the frustration has been building up and its reaching its peak mental illness aside you are only human and its natural to get frustrated when things are stressful i dont think its unreasonable to speak out when all you needed in the first place das a straight answer make sure you unwind outside of work and visit your doctor for some blood tests to check your levels ~vw~,1
arielle oligny gabrielle tremblay ❤,0
ive been diagnosed as bipolar for 23 years but was bipolar with no diagnosis for years before that i have felt hopeless so many times even to say a daily struggle with feelings of hopelessness,0
hopeless sounds like low energy and at minimum mild depression by now you may have self confidence and self esteem issues as well and thus some social anxiety are you in counseling? are you in a bp support group? do you get a little exercise? have you considered a pet? have you evaluated your meds with your doctor because its not normal for you to be suffering,1
ive had it for 17 years everyday is a struggle but i have found with therapy the right meds and spousal support it is possible to make it the older i get the worse it gets i just chose to handle it differently,1
i was diagnosed last year and its a struggle :(,0
there is strong evidence to support bipolar runs in families this true in mine without getting personal as some members are still alive but a very close relative has just been diagnosed get the help now even if your fears are unfounded good luck,0
as a person who fights suicidal ideations every day and as a person whos attempted suicide quite a number of times throughout my life this post was in a very strange way reassuring you get tired of hearing how other people will feel nobody seems to care how you feel no one understands the deep hole of despair thats suicidal person is in no one understands the bone-chilling pain that a suicidal person is always in and how every day is a struggle not to try to kill yourself,0
its not the main reason its just a reason that is a lot easier to hold onto and believe suicidal people dont care about themselves anymore but more often than not they still care deeply about their family it could be why they bottled up all their feelings and let it get to that point because they didnt want to worry anyone oh and this is someones life were talking about if guilt tripping keeps someone alive until they can find a better reason to stay alive thats a success in my book,0
this is true i currently am one whenever someone says it it makes me feel guilty and a lot worse we all know they would miss you but what ppl think when their suicidal is i have no life thats whats important to focus on and this says just that,0
such a simple acknowledgement but so true you shouldnt be afraid to do things in life that benefit you first instead of others people need to make themselves first which the mentality of the suicidal person is that everyone is above them that needs to go!,0
okay but the only reason im alive today is because i realized how my death would affect others it took me years to reach a place where i felt like i deserved to live for my own sake sometimes in a crisis you do what it takes to stay alive yes its just a temporary fix but so is putting pressure on a bleeding wound if it keeps you alive until you can reach a more permanent solution its valid,0
guilt trips make you feel like more of a worthless loser calling me selfish doesnt help,0
when youre suicidal youre in the tunnel and its black theres no light at the end of the tunnel and it hurts and its disorienting and scary and you can even hyperventilate to the point at which you become calm because you begin to think youll kill yourself and start developing a plan i think the key is faith and not necessarily in god just faith that just as theres darkness naturally there will be lightness very soon and you can withstand this pain that will definitely release you when the light in the tunnel enters and it will at this point you will breathe better think more clearly and positively and walk away from the black spell you will have missed a bullet and get on with the rest of your day sometimes it really is just an analogy to help your head survive,0
ive never known a suicidal person that was thinking rationally its a deep deep hole where self worth doesnt matter and theyve even come to the point that they think their families would be better off without them ive felt it and ive seen it i feel very confident in this belief no its not a selfish act! and thats a horrible thing to say but in those moments the logic of understanding what the life of a survivor would forever be is a big deal and caring about those other people is a lot easier to do than to care about ones self they need support understanding and kindness but this post sounds like an attention getting and not someone so tired with life that they are done,0
thats horrible!!! i hate that we have to live with so much judgement even those that are trying to get attention need attention need help and theyre in danger of things going too far i hate it,0
yes suicide does hurt loved ones it still will never be the way to help a suicidal person to heap guilt on top of their self loathing to try and get them to stop feeling the anguish they are feeling would you also tell someone with cancer that they cant die because their loved ones would be hurt? depression is an illness just like any other #endthestigma and stop trying to tell depressed people their disease is less important than other peoples,0
that is the only reason i have not killed myself because of guilt i feel as if it would be too selfish,0
yeah it boils down to approach theres is encouragment and theres guilt tripping support not judgement being encouraged to think of your loved ones is not the same as being accused of being selfish for supposedly not considering them some people mean well others are just assholes,0
but there is a difference between you thinking about your family and making the decision to hold on and somebody else throwing guilt at you and calling you selfish for needing your pain to end trying to guilt people into not suffering from a mental illness is just as ludicrous as trying to guilt a cancer patient for being sick,0
yeahyou know you are getting realngood at hiding when you can hide an anxiety attack not the big ones but some of the otherd,1
as far as i know there are pregnancy safe meds to take but very very few im almost 8 months pregnant been on zoloft the whole time and i have 3 different types of doctors all telling me zoloft is safe some meds are class c and the doctor has to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk they may decrease your dosage or take you off completely and give you something considered safe most of the time staying on your meds while pregnant is better for you and the baby you staying stable is whats best for the baby they will watch you closely talk to your doctor about zoloft its worked well for me tho yes everyone reacts different its helped keep me stable with my bipolar depression and anxiety,1
being that i doubt youve been pregnant or have a medical degree i dont think your feedback is applicable to the question,0
paul david has written books that help with anxiety they are really helpfully cbt is really good too i wish you well ☺,1
he needs to see a therapist for some cbt if they can do it via facetime or skype it would be great to get that in then pinpoint what started the anxiety did he have an attack one day and then fearful of it ever since to the point that its now become so disabling? is he a veteran? ptsd? seems that its the negative self talk and thoughts that are getting to him right now by not being able to go out i take prozac buspar and xanax when needed i know you said buspar didnt work but how about trazadone? therapy is honestly going to help him in conjunction with the meds,1
it sucks i have a social anxiety where ill be okay for awhile like in a mall then all of a sudden get very overwhelmed,1
ask to try proprananol its worked really well with my anxiety x,1
desiree rivera theyre classed as beta blockers im prescribed up to 40mg per day in 10mg tablets to take as and when needed theyre whats usually prescribed for exam anxiety and driving lesson anxiety etc but are great for taking the edge off a situation like going out and busy places etc but he may benefit from an antidepressant at the same time i see hes tried sertraline i didnt get on with that have u tried citalopram? x,1
very down in the dumps very scared of having an anxiety attack he felt like a disappointment and embarrassed,1
taking any medicine while trying or during pregnancy should be avoided or minimised based on the risks of taking or not taking the medication as clonazepam is a benzodiazepine there is a risk that your baby will suffer withdrawal when born as drug will pass through your systems to babies you and your dr need to discuss pros and cons of stopping or continuing i dont think clonazepam has specific risks to foetal development,1
i took all my medicine for bipolar/anxiety/ depression safely my daughter is 14 and perfectly fine i had blood work done every month to make sure my liver was doing well i also had extra sonograms to ensure she was developing properly i think if you have your ob/gyn and physchiatrist work together throughout your pregnancy you should be able to take your meds throughout on a side note - if you are stressed the baby will be stressed as well always weigh the pros vs the cons,1
i took it all through out my pregnancy the doctor said it was safe and it was important for me to be stable while i was pregnant than to risk an episode that could be dangerous i now have an amazing healthy three year old son,1
i was on prozac for 3-4 months it was for stress induced seizures i had these side effects i took myself off and cleansed my system about a week and a half later i was ok,1
it took me three attempts to find something which worked: sertraline the only downside was it gave me an upset stomach but the first drug turned me into a zombie the second made the anxiety worse like anything; some drugs work for some some dont and side-effects may affect one person but not another if it doesnt work for you try something else also most meds say not to just stop them but wean,1
typically there are side effects initially especially if you start on too high a dose but prozac is proven for anxiety and depression i wouldnt give up on it,1
i have bipolar disorder depression ocd and personality disorder i just want u 2 know i was diagnosed with depression when i had my daughter 8yrs ago i then went on to realise i had much more undiagnosed but was so afraid to tell my doctor the truth as the same as you was worried about the care of my daughter and to be judged as a bad parent many years went on and i met a new partner 4yrs ago and he picked up on it strait away i was in denial altho deep down i knew something was wrong it got to the point where i had to tell a doctor and in all honesty it was the best thing i ever done as they was so supportive and couldnt help me more my child is well looked after i told them as they do have to ask and the doctor and psychiatrist honestly take your word unless they have evidence to proof otherwise u need help and need to confined in a doctor before it gets too latei dont have panic attacks anymore i dont have anxiety i sleep i do everything i should be doing  but i do have 1 bad day out of say about 7 or 8 but it beats everyday life im so proud of getting the help and care i need for me and has helped my daughter 2 u reli should have a think about what is best for your children which means is best for you take care hun and get some help xxx,1
from the symptoms you described i would agree yoyare suffering g from depression its very common to have anxiety and panic attacks as symptoms of depression too i cant comment on whether you are bipolar but nothing you have described suggests you are as for bpd medication doesnt really help talking therapy and cbt and again depression anxiety can be co-occuring i would congratulate yourself for studying working and caring for your child that is so amazing and takes immense srtebgth perhaps go back to your gp there are lots of antidepressants and spme are particularly good for combatting anxiety and panic attacks alongside depression you are a star,1
relax your mind dont overwhelm your self and stick to a healthy diet when all else fails turn to jesus to comfort and heal you !!,0
drowning means your body and especially your mind is overwhelmed and right now you cant cope with whats on your plate which is a lot your a mother a wife a cook a cleaner a student a worker a woman with multiple mental illnesses of which not all are getting the treatment they deserve so you can not cry for 3 hours straight and not want to work! time to get honest because your borderline is active and maybe your bipolar causing panic attacks its a spiral that you need help to regulate and prevent in the future good luck honey just be honest sweetheart,1
start by telling your doctor about all of your symptoms the right medication can go a long way towards getting you back on track i have major depression anxiety ocd ptsd insomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome ive been at rock bottom including not being able to get out of bed to care for my family for days my doctor wasnt interested in reporting me only in helping me and you need to be honest with your husband he is your partner and your support system chances are he will be way more concerned about your well being than anything else,1
i have everything you listed above my so was taking mirtrazipine for his insomnia but i took some once to see if they helped me long story short nothing helped me then again i only took one prescription or type of med at the same time was never on any sort of cocktail i know that for me the antipsychotics dulled me and the antidepressants just made me want to hurt myself even more the anti anxiety worked but only one type and theyre so hard toget here anyway what ended up working for me was spending more time outside meditation yoga and spending time focusing on me meditation helped a lot with the disordered thoughts and the psychosis other than that i would say you might benefit from finding a doc you trust and a therapist that will listen to you and help you try to navigate the pathways of your mind if you wanna chat my inbox is always open wishing you the best,1
if you havent got a visible illness most people dont have a clue how you feel and think they have the right to think you dont have a disabled illness if you have a sudden panic attack/anxiety they cant see it and dont understand that you need to rush sometimes passed them to get a taxi immediately to get home but they think you are being rude think i need a tattoo on my forehead to let people know that i do have an illness xx,0
anyone who takes their own life must be in a horrible state unless you have been there you cant possibly imagine the pain these people are going through i do believe in the future there will medication and a lot more help and people will say "oh god you just let these people suffer" in the meantime we just got to hang on in there as hard as it is this site is really good at least you dont feel so alone,0
this is vary true we r never alone in this fight and struggl every day! i send each and everyone on this post love and hugs and paires as well as blessing we r never alone thier is help and thier r people out here that r going thought the same thing that we all r going through dont let our mintal illness blind us and take our lives and our joy we all can come together and fight this demenwe as a body of one can help and start to hael each other we just need to learn how to help and love each other and to love ourselves i live this mental illness all my life for at least 45 years of my life! we r brave we r strong and we can fight this illness! i love u all my paires r with all of u,0
i think about it often its so true just to end the pain and torture of your own mind no cureonly band-aid fixes i wish almost daily that i wasnt here at the same time i am scared to die and dont truly want to die i am too scared to take my own life but i definitely want to some days more than others :(,0
its a real struggle for me these last few months,0
so true every nite i pray i die in my sleep but in reality all i really want is to b happy and for my family to b happy and love each otha sick of living and feeling this way the sadness the sense of failure the guilt and over whelming sense of hopelessness and having to pretend everythings ok its exhausting my family will neva fix itself and i pray for a beta way but thats neva gonna happen so praying for a quik painless death is the nxt best option,0
its tough out there its a constant struggle with life always there to kick you in the ribs when you fall,0
my family and i just buried my husbands best friend today he suffered from depression and was in the middle of an extreme episode when he took his life i cannot imagine the pain he mustve been feeling to push him to do what he did he had so many people he could have gone to for help my husband is really struggling trying to understand why,0
i doubt it it is only and always a flaw in chemistry when all the circumstances are so bad all the doors you knock are locked by thousand locks when you cant even trust the ground under your feet when everyone is acting like you are a burden when you cant have fun for very very long time when you dont feel all the good feeling for such long time there is nothing anchoring you to this world and reality you start to fade awayin the hard circumstance of life i guess being depressed is a normal reaction from our body and soul there is nothing and nobody filling you up with positivity you try your best to go on by your energies but how long it can last really? 2 year 5 year even but not 10 years! after that there is this undeniable feeling of hopelessness that is normal for a year you almost forget it burying in the deepest grounds unaware of that it starts to grow and grow and one day you notice all your world is dark when you look up you see that little feeling of hopelessness that you thought you were got rid of by burying it had grown so big that casts its shadow all over your life! there is no escape but with a help from outside and a person who is really cares and whats to help but i am sorry that everyone is so busy with their live or accusing you with different thingsyou must be so lucky to has someone that cares so deeply that will do anything for you to just see you smilei hope all of you will have all the help you need god bless you all with total mental and physical health,0
depression is the darkest cloud you never want to face it seeps into your bloodstream and takes ahold eventually of your spirit like a parasite it globs on to you and doesnt let go until its had its way with you the experience is scary sometimes free-falling and bleak what it cant take is all your mind and what you believe in and those are the threads by which i hang on everytime,0
its absolutely correct face your fears the opposite will keep you from ever moving forward,1
im just having a hard time right now everything is irritating me ,0
i have depression and anxiety not fun,1
i suffer with depression & anxiety that can get really bad in seconds when something or someone triggers it,1
yenz maelstrom yes ive kept my job for 18 years but it hasnt been without the odd major blip the key for me was to religiously take my medication behind all the craziness of my illness was a little bit of logic i desperately wanted the same things as everybody else to have as much of a normal life as possible there are times where this is not possible because of the illness but i keep trying working for me its a distraction from being unwell it isnt easy but i keep at it i have recently been treated for breast cancer and i am on the phased return to work at the moment after being off for five months i think to myself what else can life throw at me whatever life does throw at me i will fight it as hard as i can ,0
thanks for sharing that im in a good place just worried ill ruin it the fact that you kept a job for 18 years gives me hope,0
cant believe how powerful the mind is sometimes the negative feelings just take over and yes its hard to feel alive and happy even when you try so hard to block them out they just come straight back in leaving you feeling empty and confused very hard to face the day sometimes,0
tony dennis i have been living with bipolar 1 for more than 30 years it took years to get my meds right but i feel all emotions joy happiness sadness anger fear etc please talk to your doctor only feeling sadness is not normal,1
we are moving to another town 4 hours away my wife and her friends are really struggling to say goodbye to each other were going to a second going away party tonight we are also going out for dinner on wednesday we leave on friday theyll all be hugging and telling each other through tears how much theyll love and miss each other ill just stand there with a stupid look on my face trying to comprehend it all i dont want to be like this i want to have what my wife has but im just not capable of those feelings,0
are you elevating your hand? try smaller meals soup scrambled eggs cream of wheat hot cereal make sure you keep drinking fluids try watching some of your favorite tv shows know that you didnt feel this way two days ago think about last weekend and what you did remember some good times and know that when your hand is a bit better youll be out again this feeling is horrible right now but it will pass as it always has,0
marjorie is right no amount of advice from us will make any difference if u feel like that call your crisis team dont risk it,0
i take 15 mg of abilify and 80 mg of celexa bipolar anxiety and depression i also see a counsellor every two weeks to work on cognitive behavioural therapy stuff plus yoga almost everyday at a local studio,1
risperlet venlor (venlafaxine/aka effaxor?) and tegretol just got added another one for severe anxiety but the name escapes me been on the same three for just over 5months was diagnosed properly about 4 years ago and have been guinea pigging meds since trying to find the correct combination,1
seroquel xr 400 and klonopin for anxiety,1
i took a blood test that can show how your body metabolizes different medications not a clue how it works or what the crazy report means -looks like a bunch of #s and letters to me but it helped i was told that if you metabolize it too fast it wont get in your system and work i feel like i tried them all (serequel abilify lexapro zoloft ambien xanax cymbalta lexapro topamax zyprexa) probably others i have forgotten still trying to find the right combo but some had horrible side affects just trial and error is all you can do,1
lithum and celexa been playing with others but no good was taking 1mg of risperdol and i went frikimg paranoid and could not sleep only afer a cpuple days droped that quick still have paranoya and anxiety but more managable,1
i have adhd bipolar and anxiety i am on lamictal xanax buspar and just started on rexulti because seroquel was making me fat and latuda made me aggressive really liking the rexulti i rapid cycle and havent been this stable in years,1
i take lamictal safris oraly  invega and abilify shots for bipolar one and clonopin and seroquel for anxiety its a big cocktail but its totally worth it my bipolar simptoms r under control for the meantime ,1
i have bp ii lamictal wellbutrin zoloft 1-2 100 mg seroquel for anxiety (my psychiatrist took me off all benzos) 400mg of seroquel at night primarily for sleep,1
lamictal but i just started and i think it might be causing me to become aggravated in the afternoon so im gonna keep taking it to give it a chance but will stop if it gets worse i really dont want to go on lithium latuda works great for me at the right dose but my legs get too jumpy and my body is restless so i cant take it which sucks because otherwise its perfect for me also take klonopin for anxiety nothing for depression as i am resistant to all ssris and ssnris ive tried almost all of them and none worked never taken abilify did try a new med called vraylar but had a severe reaction to full unrinary retention and needed a foley catheter for 2 weeks that was months ago and im still having urinary issues with delayed urination,1
i take lithium (1200mg/day) and seroquel xr (600mg/day) im still not sure if thats the right combo for me because my anxiety plays tricks on me so its hard to tell im seeing a therapist for my anxiety instead of taking more meds,1
i take lithium and seroquel i found the right med combo for me about 3 years ago but it was one of the hardest things i ever went through i got diagnosed after a very bad and long manic episode so while i was finding the right meds i was depressed everyday for months and spent a lot of time sleeping i tried a lot of different meds before i found the right ones my mom and stepdad were very supportive and let me stay with them i also went to a bipolar support/educational group once a week that was so helpful the leader taught us about bipolar and how to talk to our doctors since it can be hard in the beginning describing how you feel and knowing the doctor lingo i went off my meds recently for a few months and ended up in another manic episode and in the mental hospital but ive been back on my meds for about a month and am finally feeling back to my normal self thank goodness! i was taught that the best combination for bipolar is a mood stabilizer to keep you from going too low and an antipsychotic to keep from going into manias i also took an anti anxiety med in the beginning because i had very bad social anxiety while trying to find the right meds i hope the best for you i know how hard it is i was actually very against medications when i first got diagnosed but truly had no other option and now at this point i am so grateful for it i would hear people talk in my support group about feeling like the person that were intended to be on meds and i never thought it would be that way for me and it is i hope that is helpful and wish nothing but the best for you ❤,1
schizoaffective disorder bpd bipolar and anxiety i was getting a monthly injection of invega sustenna then went to an injection once every three months of invega trinza for the most part it worked however the side affects of the trinza were too much for me to handle mentally ive been unmedicated for 2 months and in pretty much hell,1
hey everyone! breaks my heart to know what people are going through its rough love to you all i used to take lamotrigine for three years but it didnt do much i now take a supplement regimen based on blood tests which isnt perfect but helps a lot! also making sure my diet has the full spectrum for all the nutrients i need i take zinc because i have too much copper in my system l-theanine for anxiety fish oil kelp for thyroid and a few other things i really recommend naturopathic remedies which i was skeptical of at first i have xanax and clonzepam for anxiety attacks but i try not to take those too much because they are addictive i have bipolar 1 and generalized anxiety disorder hope this helps everyone!,1

i take lithium lamictal seroquel and prazison but i have bipolar 1 ptsd and anxiety,1
is there any cure for bpd and witch is worse bipolar or bpd and whats the difference please im confused thankyou,1
im sorry but we are incurable they truly understand so little about the mind ive lived with it for 40 years and it is manageable with therapy and right meds bipolar comes with so many side "orders" anxiety ptsd sleeplessness personality disorders,1
i am the mom and wife to three very functional and amazing bipolar folks medication therapy lots of exercise and my daughter will tell you avoid junk food--the sugar high and low exacerbates the symptoms,1
medications can get rid of bipolar symptoms but then bring on depression anxiety panic attacks etc no simple surgery can "fix" all that,1
if u genuinely got bipolar its best to avoid taking any drug as it can make psychotic episodes go from terryfying to dangerous,1
actually while weed is effective in treating several mental illnesses such as ptsd anxiety and depression tests show that it worsens symptoms in bipolar disorder schizophrenia and others possibly even causing psychosis if you have bipolar disorder stay away from marijuana,1
i have no idea how to tell someone im feeling like this im always afraid of them thinking im attention seeking or something,0
years ago in a therapy group i was in fine meant fucked-up insecure neurotic and emotional saying we were fine wasnt allowed we had to learn how to express feelings instead of acting like we dont matter,0
it shows the most in there eyes then when you try to live with somebody that doesnt take there meds  if you care about them this embalace can make a whole house in turmoil they wont addmit they have a problem they just find away to blame it on you its sad to watch somebody life that is bipolar if a person is diagnose bipolar it sucks but if you care about that person your life will be happier helping them to stay on they meds been through it for 22 years,1
tara sweet her name is sweetswhen i would talk to her teachers they would always say how the girls fit there names her sis is name is precious i would always say are we talking bout my sweets at home she was always be made i was disabled when they were born they stayed with us from birth i kinda felt cheated out of being a grand pa but i would trade the life i had with them 2 for any thing they would come home in 1 and 2nd grade upset because other kids had moms and dads picking them up so i say them down and watched andy griffith show  i showed them how he calls his dad pa i became pa and they never felt like they were missing out on anything i became pa to every one that they new i had kids calling me pa i never new but always answered them like we new each other for years to this day 20 years later im still pa and well known by ones the girls know its truly been a gift of life for me,0
thank you for your honesty most folks have no ones how it effect you and the turmoil you feel over what others would think is know big deal my hand daughter is 22 she quit taking her meds when she got out of schoolit kills me to see her just be pissed all the time i was stay at home pa she told me when she was little i was like having 2 grandmasso were close when she would finally get to me i would say to her i love you but go play in the road this changed her she would smile and the mood would change for hours any advise to help her get back on her meds a desperate pa,0
i was told to give myself a shake before being diagnosed with bipolar!,1
upon his observations falret noticed that anxiety is a part of rapid cycling moods and bipolar disorder as is source touched with fire by k r jamison,1
rapid cycling bipolar disorder is particularly almost impossible to live with as mania and depression over short periods or even from day to day the moods may even merge as they mix and so we have rapid cycling mixed moods there is a link between mania and depression thus with a mixed state mania is depression in a more intense form mania and depression are which are dreadful diseases are one disorder mania can moreover but distinguished from depression by degree and manifestation jean pierre falret in the mid-nineteenth century posited that strong depression often occurs before during and after mania bipolar disorder is a truly dreadful illness and i have the rapid cycling divergent form with hypo mania which is more difficult to treat i would not wish it on anyone,1
aftet a thirty year struggle just found a shrink who tells me the only way is a combo of meds and psycho therapy had both before but not together looking forward to the next stage of the journey its all a learning curve to those of you out there that are still in the acute phasese hold tbe the faith love light and peace,0
i wonder if youre on the right meds mood stabilizers are good for controlling anxiety and depression like lithium and zonisamide and a benzo and a hobby suicide is no way out its the absolute end its giving up and im sure you havent tried everything!,1
hi rosalind you are not alone sweetheart im 29 i have severe anxiety panic disorder and its been 1 year since being out in public i only go to my doctor with my brother by my side and i have a specific taxi driver ive known for 6 years drive me there and straight home i have not been to a shopping centre a park a beach no where i wont even get the mail from the letter box i have no friends and no one knows i exist i hate when people walk past my house gives me anxiety i do not answer the door or phone i truly and completely know your situation darling and yes it gets to feeling like your a prisoner my heart hurts for you because i know how you feel so much :( xxxxxoooo i send you huge hugs,0
all the time take meds and struggle daily some days are better than other,0
exposure therapy is the way to tackle it take someone with you wholl hold your hand and then baby steps out that door practice deep breathing exercises out there get yourself calm then a few more steps do a bit more with each day or do it morning and again in the afternoon its like a fear of flying the only way is to fly and repeat flying loses the fear exposure therapy dear,0
my best friend has borderline ptsd schizophrenia bipolar depression psychopathy disorder anxiety and compulsive lying disorder and she blames everything on me my family and her family and daughter instead of taking responsibility for her actions she keeps emotionally abusing us and manipulating us with lies and is very controlling and treats us like crap and hurts us she refuses to get help and she demanded a break from me because she claimed i didnt understand all i ever tried to do was get her to get help and take responsibility for her actions she wont get help and its hard on me because im autistic and cant communicate properly i have aspergers so i misinterpret social situations and cant always express myself correctly and i get emotional meltdowns due to inability to communicate plus i have depression and anxiety so its hard on me dealing with my best friend she just wont listen i wish she would get help and stop blaming everyone else for her problems and i wish she could see the pain shes caused me i have caused her pain with my meltdowns but i always apologize and try to understand but she just wont its hard to know what to do anymore because nothing gets through to her people judge me too and reject me when i get too emotional for them to handle and tell me to handle things myself plus i complain all the time because i can be a drama queen at times so its very hard dealing with this because the autism community has it especially hard because we want to be accepted for who we are but instead people refuse to be there and try to change us into something we are not its just so unfair and overwhelming dealing with all the ignorance,0
some people fear the mentally ill rather than help them even those who say they love someone who is mentally ill often reacts with anger and resentment instead of understanding mental health education needs to be more prevalent it angers me to see those who are ill taken advantaged of,0
i was reaffirming a post not sure what youre confused about,0
im pushing my bf away i dont mean to today im going to tell him whats going on and what ive been thinking cause it has ruined my relationships in the past i love my bf a lot and dont want to lose him over my anxiety im tired of it trying to rule my life,0
i become obsessed with a thought and i forget to do important things i have to make lists to stay on task,0
i love you and i know it just worries me sometimes,0
sometimes people over think things and they give themselves grief unnecessarily having a positive attitude and good outlook on things helps to lessen anxiety ,0
i tried off and on for years but it only made it worse for me i had problems with any job i had my emotional outbursts would be horrible and my ups and downs were incredibly painful then i was diagnosed in my 40s while my cocktail has been adjusted it works but diet therapy psychiatry and other supports are important too balance is the key,0
type 1 and med free for over a year - but i worked hard on recognising signs symptoms and triggers and still use some medication as needed to calm anxiety/mania if needed,1
i was diagnosed in 2013 im currently not on anything for my bipolar but my pcp just started me on wellbutrin for my horrible anxiety also have generic xanax my bipolar meds made me a zombie and i gained a ton of weight my family and friends that know im bipolar have said im better off them than when i was on them,0
i tried coming of meds but started struggling after a week but everyone is different so good luck,1
ive been med free since 2013 but im also only bipolar 2 so i dont have huge mania its mania to me but by doctors standards its nothing i have more depressive episodes than anything and im easily stressed but im personally better off like this than i was with meds i also do not have suicidal ideologies and never have so its probably easier for me than someone with them some people it works for and some it does not,1
once you come off your meds it can stay in the system for a bit im currently going without but thats because i moved and only just got round to changing doctors 5 months later! i do get very low moments and get a bit worried but im picking myself up i have found ive seperated myself from people more just want my kids around me and family im seeing a ne doctor next week though i guess you just need to be so aware of yourself and any mood change meds are not a quick fix and take a while to get into the system xxx,0
oh and jennifer i think your comment is a little broad-brush yes perhaps it is practically impossible to be 100% symptom-free but that doesnt mean someone not taking meds for it doesnt have bipolar i had it for 30 years before i started taking the right meds and i got by just fine - but after taking anti-depressants from my mid 20s i continued to deteriorate rapidly until i was around 30 when a correct diagnosis was made since then ive been markedly "better" but unfortunately a lot of damage was already done to myself and my life and thats now what im struggling with as it amplifies my symptoms,1
i doubt that you could be med-free & fully functional long term with an illness like bipolar me i rattle like a bottle of pills when i walk and i still struggle a huge amount being off meds can cause a more severe relapse but at the same time if you are med free and coping well because you have made significant changes in your life / lifestyle to work around bipolar then there is the potential that it could work for a select few,1
warning : may be a trigger if not allowed please delete then i must be weak yesterday around 3 -4am i couldnt fight the monster anymore i thought i had enuff fight in me but no luck im so embarrassed for what i did and feel so stupid for doing it  i self harmed / suicide attempt  i am just putting this out there so maybe one person can relate and get the help that they need  call your nearness crisis line or call 911 please i waited about 12 - 14 hours after i did it  one side of my brain was telling me to call to get the help i need but the other side of my brain was telling me no  i called n got help that i need i am home now under 24 hour watch for the next couple days  my choice since hospitals are a very big trigger for me  sorry for being so long i just needed to tell my story  stay strong keep fighting never give up,0
so true! last night i had a severe panic attack where i literally thought i was dying most people dont know how to deal in those situations my mom jumped in and helped me calm down and she seemed to just know how to be there for me those people are treasures in our lives,0
look at what you do have dont focus on the negative being bipolar is not negative there are some with cancer right now that would trade places with us in a heart beat you said you work full time then thats great! some people struggle to find one i dont know much about your life but for me i started giving myself manicures and pedicures i went for walks and just refected on how i had a job my children were healthy i had a home and food to provide start thinking about everything you do have that someone else might not have and youll find yourself rich in happiness!,0
keep searching for the thing that works for you and the way of life you need to stop you struggling change is difficult talk and talk to those you trust life can be a struggle but make it your struggle for what you truly need and want sometimes and often its the simplest of things and sometimes not things at all but feelings - peace calm the mind,0
i embrace it its all ive ever known the day i wake up and dont hate everything about myself and dont want to die will be a scary day,0
set an alarm for the time to take your meds even though its something we do every single day we can still forget,0
as a medical professionaldo not google meds it will just make you crazy! anytime anyone has a "side effect" and reports it it will be put on prescription leaflets and websites as a side effecteven if one person in the whole world was the only person to have this side effect youll worry yourself sick about having the same experience knowledge is power discuss with your doctor the side effects that you have experienced on previous meds or that youve heard of others experiencing they are there to help you( if they are a good doctor that is) and will discuss pros and cons of the medication i have turned down certain medications because i didnt want to take a chance on certain side effects after discussing it with my doctor you should never feel afraid to ask your doctor your questions different meds are going to work better for others due to their genealogy there is testing nowadays that they can test what medication would work best with your individual gene structure and has helped stop a lot of the trial and error med trials many of us have endured hope this helps,1
just got pulled off of it high blood pressure lightning migraine and stroke zone heart symptoms i also experienced a huge increase in rage,1
wellbutrin brought on mania for me irrational anger and agitation is mania for many of us i do not know your diagnosis but it is well documented that most anti- depressants are not a good solution for bi polar disorder,1
it worked really well for the first year or two but now makes my anxiety out of control so then i had to decide anxiety out depression?,1
elevated hr elevated blood pressure increased anxiety sweating weight loss,1
read leaflet inside med box and if worried call dr to ask about combination and side effects,0
googling or webmding will give you pill anxiety if you read to much,1
it doesnt upset me it just makes me feel alone,0
one of my cats is called ember too but people call her amber which is not the same even on her passport it is spelt amber i was too shy to tell them to fix it i call her beenie now,0
im not ashamed or apologize for being ill i feel for those who hide through lifei havent hid in over a decade,0
ive taken many medicines for anxiety/add/depression/bipolar and my doctor didnt want to give me lithium unless as a last resort it apparently has lots of side effects,1
i am on 400mg lithium 500mg navalparo in morning and at night 550mg navalparo 450mg lithium and 650mg quetiapine and tranquipam 5mg - i hate lithuim when i started with it i suffered hairloss nausea runny nose and shaking its better now because they test my blood regularly and i gained 30 pounds i cant get rid of,1
seroquel=weight gain for me it meant lots of weight gain i gained a little over 100 lbs in a little over a year stopped gaining as soon as they took me off but now stuck with 100 unwanted pounds that im struggling to lose sad part is that seroquel is the only med that ive felt actually helped :-(,0
mixing and rapid cycling of moods alexander of tralles (c 575) wrote that individuals tended to have cycles of mania and melancholia and that "mania is nothing else but melancholia in a more intense form" by the sixteenth century jason pratensis had concluded that "most physicians associate mania and melancholia (truly dreadful diseases) as one disorder" by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries most medical writers thought of mania as an extreme form of melancholia doctors jean pierre falret and jules baillarger in the mid-nineteenth century formally posited that mania and depression could represent different manifestations of a single illness falret noted the strong depressive quality often occurring before during and after manic episodes as well as melancholic anxiety (touched with fire k r jameson 1993) yoga can help practice it in class or at home,1

so fucking true that is me for the pass 2 weeks  i know i need the help im just afraid that i will go to get admitted and they will send me back home  that happened to me 3 xs already im just so confused and lost ,0
i found i cut so that it gave me something to focus on it forced me to take care of myself i got lucky im finally on some better meds my moods are fairly stable for the most part better than they have as long as i can remember i also have an amazing therapy cat that will keep head butting me and trying to get my attention until i stop hyperventilating or crying and ficus on him at first i didnt know why he was doing it and i used to get mad but i realized he only does it when im at my worst if possible maybe having an emotional support animal might be something to consider someone that needs love and a home that would be grateful for being saved he or she would help give you something else to focus on plus find a good doctor see if you need meds if it doesnt work right away try some new ones and dont be afraid to ask for help! hugs ❤️,1
when i get to that point i self hospitalize just check yourself in and get the help you need in a safe environment wi th staff that knows how to help and deal with you im really sorry you are feeling so horrible i get like that too im willing to talk to you just to give you a distraction if you want to pm me id rather you check into a hospital though youre not alone,0
call someone you know and trust immediately dont be afraid or ashamed im sure theres someone in your phone who youd drop everything for in an emergency try a few people out you will be surprised obviously if its late at night you may not get an immediate response so do not let that get you down if no luck call an ambulance if its night time get in bed and have a good sleep then reflect on your situation in the morning and see a doctor yesterday its not abnormal to feel like this - yes its an illness but plenty of normal people suffer these things and they just hide it better (which is a bad thing and often makes you worse) i hesitate to get directly involved with other sufferers but if you are stuck for someone to talk to you are welcome to send me a message,0
it doesnt ease your difficulty but bear in mind that many of us here and many people in general society will have had at least one crushing breakup in their time so believe me you can and will get over it but again remember that wont ease your pain and dont expect it to this is a natural reaction to the situation and many people go through different thought processes after such events i had one early on as a young lad and later in life i was divorced not long after believe me i thought i was toast both times years on i now have a loving partner and two kids (not mine but they act like they are!) who think im tops i still have my struggles but at the end of the day my life is better than i vould ever have imagined,0
i used to self harm for many years and looked online at the time for online support groups which helped i also got over cutting slowly through the help of a very good friend who taught me to write my pain away through journals and poetry id never written poetry until then aged 35 they were deep and dark i started posting them on various self harm forums and it really helped im now 46 and last time i cut i was 40 and had been doing it since i was 14 apart from seeking medical help please keep what i called a self care box at hand new fresh clean razor antiseptic wipes butterfly stiches ect it keeps you safe i learned that after a wound of mine got badly infected so is very important! i personally learned i used to cut to forget the pain but in a vicious circle every scar reminded me daily of all the parts of life i was desperate to forget instead of escaping my past each scar is permanent reminderbut i can only see that now i have stopped i hope this helps xxx,1
i sought help for my self mutilation as well after 6 yrs of hurting myself i saw a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety that was triggering depression/ cutting episodes i got put on zoloft and let me tell you best decision ive ever made i still experience mild anxiety but i feel no urge to hurt myself now,1
just really struggling at the moment ive been given some numbers to call,0
if you fear you may hurt yourself or someone else please seek help you got this we all have had to fight that ugly monster,1
super task focused extreme anger if interupted cant sleep road rageirrational irritation and agitation,1
mania usually associated with bipolar 1 and person has lack of insight into their behaviour during episode which can have devastating impact on daily life and include lowering of inhibitions sexual behaviour impulsivity high energy but inappropriate belief they are invincible paranoia fixation etc while hypomania associated with bipolar 2 and person does not lose insight or display psychotic thoughts but high energy extreme irritability fixated and obssessed with doing something/someone something someone said  not as extreme as mania but bipolar 2 cycling between depression/ hypomania is often more frequent and hypomamia can last few weeks then occur every few weeks so very unstable,0
you are not alone during these moments i am learning to quiet my mind i could not do this until i was properly medicated my mantra is "no big tboughts" i list my tasks for the day and rely on my list it eases the mind pressure i can go from the thought of going to the grocery store to my hatred of people who i believe judge me i believe you know what i am talking aboutease up on yourself find a small reprieve,0
i need to start doing this i just got signed up for intermittent loa where i have 4 /8 hour shifts a month that i can use for call outs(they dont need to be used) if i having a flare upi have a miscarriage in june and my moods ever since have been horrible so i ended up getting wrote up at work for my call outs some days are harder then others and i think this is a great idea so that my doctor can see what my patterns look like thank you for this idea,1
its such a shame that companies will work with people with other illnesses but as soon as it comes down to mental illness its frowned on i with diagnosed with bipolar disorder/ manic depression/ anxiety when i was 12 years old im 24 now and i have always had to hide my mental illness from jobs until now when i finally got wrote up for the second time and i couldnt handle the fact of losing my job i really hope things work out for you because i know the feeling of having that laying on the back of your mind bringing you down its hard but with the right support (your meeting) it sounds like you are doing what you can to get yourself back on track i need to get into some kinda therapy or something again with all the shit going on right now i feel myself slowly falling and im scared i wont be able to catch myself,0
im in a similar situation im currently on a doctor requested loa for my bipolar/depression/anxiety because i (as i would like to call it) fell down the rabbit hole ive been in a rut since december if i had to back track my moods i would say that most of my days would of been black or red anyways im in an iop and im more than sure when i return from my loa ill be terminated because ive taken so many dys off that im negative unpaid sick hours (they give you 20hrs every quarter and since i was denied my last loa (which previously set me back to -72) i am now -150 ish hours i have nothing to cover them,0
i did lamitcal and tomapax together for my bipolar then xanax for anxiety worked good for years but then i had a episode  now im back to trying to find right combo,1
dont let your doc treat symptoms you just have bipolar like me anxiety and depression are just part of the game im currently on 900 mg of lithium only side affect ive noticed (been on it about 17 months now) is sometimes i feel a tad drowsy after nothing a cup of coffee cant fix though my appetite sometimes is out of whack too but i think thats more from the actual disorder then the medication cause ive always either eaten excessively or barely at all as long as i remember,0
unfortunately side effect if many antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs is weight gain sedation is also a side effect of many hence they are used at low doese for sleep there are loads of different medications and what works for o e person may not work for another  sadly only way of finding out is to try them it is trial and error i take it by say you bipolar anxiety and bipolar depression you mean you have bipolar disorder? ive no idea what country you are from so i dont know what healthcare system you need to clearly explain your symptoms and that side effects are outweighing the benefits of medications and discuss others you can try,1
bipolar 1 panic disorder ptsd adhd with years of mds practicing on me now on lamictal and lithium i no longer i need anti-anxiety medication or sleep medication i had to find the right dr who was actually listening to me and it took me years to figure out that medical doctors need to stop thinking they can do a psychiatric doctors job although e even in the beginning of that relationship im a lot more medication than that ever truly hard at meditation natural herbs essential oils anything that i can do to not have to swallow one more pill im down to two!,1
i agree with bettina find a new doctor my psychiatrist put me on risperidone for ptsd he tried me on ssri anti depressants like fluoxetine escitalipram snd sertraline they didnt work for me but they may work for you he also put me on imipramine which is another anti depressant that i take to this day i tried gabapentin for anxiety and diazepam meds work differently for everyone and you have to find someone whos willing to keep on trying different meds to see what works for you,1
i have ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression adhd im on lithium zoloft combination seroquel for sleep kilnopin valium,1
hey leah im sorry you are going thru this it can be completely overwhelming one of the things that this illness does is rob us of control over ourselves and our lives i am a firm believer in regaining much if not all of that control back! rick has found an excellent way to not only regain control of his body but also his thought processes he is acting in his own best interest as a coach! one of the three pillars to regain our health that i espouse for all of us feel free to contact me and ill spend some time with you and see if i can be of help james,0
i am undiagnosed but doubtless bipolar the only thing that ever helped more than medication and counseling was cleaning my diet and daily exercise until it hurts started off with 20 minutes around the block every day and became a habit i ordered some kettle bells to work at home and that hurts too it gives me a high and the pain isnt nearly what i suffered with severe active diagnosis i wake up with a head of old recordings and they burn off like the morning fog now i can see a future and medication was cut in half in 30 days it was the solution for me it was the only thing i had not tried a better life awaits me outside of my head i wish you well,1
yes i do that when my stress and anxiety is really high almost like a feeling of vertigo and then it passes,0
yes its my anxiety,1
i also have that its all pary of anxiety i got that feeling for 3 days in a row and it ended up in a panic attack in a restaurant i didnt even knew at the time what a panic attack was like i was taken to emergencies and that was what they discovered it works for me to go lie down even if i get that slightest feeling for 10 min and relax each muscle and mind hope it works for u,1
u should try to never be out of meds if i start to get panic attacks now i breath in and out in a brown paper bag and i put a mild sedative under the tongue try and do 10 min of complete relaxation per day in the afternoon or evening,0
yup makes sense ive been under a lot of stress and anxiety the last few days plus the weather change affects my anxiety too i had panic disorder for over 10 years which progressed into gad im out of meds right now so maybe i will try some tea and a bath until i get more,1
i was told years ago i had bipolar type two but then told i did not so years of trying to manage my severe anxiety and depression by self and begging for someone to help i got phychosis from being so ill so was sectioned hospital stay for couple months 2 years later i had a manic episode and was sectioned and then a depressive episode and sectioned then told i have bipolar 1 and 2 if treated in the first place i would not have gone on to mania and had phychosis again im on lots of meds hate it but keeps me stable but feel flat and like a zombie in the morngings  the mania is completely different than to manic in type 2 this time i thought i was working for the cia i was also eve my partner was adam etc but the low after the come down is so horrid  its hard for us all as we have to stay positive to stay well but days where we feel so fatigued and heavy,1
i have bipolar type 1 rapid cycling forgot to add anxiety and panic attacks,1
also have mixed states and rapid cycling i am bipolar 1 my manic episodes manifest in extreme itritability and uncontrollable aggression and rage following on its heels deep depression last few months seldom normal episodes keep getting up and down,1
i live day by day i dont worry about tomorrow,0
its the fear and anxiety of being stuck while life passes me by,1
read the product rundown online youll find an info sheet it will give a list of minor and major sid effects and instruction to immediately discontinue use or seek urgent medical advice for any extreme effects im not familiar with the drug itself but they will all have some side effects and in most cases they are worse at the start until your body gets used to things also make sure youre eating well and drinking plenty of water one of the drugs im on er blocks me up so i can get stomach pains from that dont be afraid to tell your doctor youre not comfortable with the drug and ask to try something different but at the same time if its a minor ish side effect (eg constipation) then it might go away of its own accord or be fixed with a change to diet etc,1
i was lamical did nt help me so my psyc put me on lithium  started out on zoloft that did nt work  i tried about everything  i seen him on thursday and he added the zoloft in combination with the lithium now its a wait in see game i suffer from ptsd severe anxiety severe depression bi polar 1 adhd suicidal ideation,1
suicidal ideation isnt actually a diagnosis it just means you have suicidal thoughts which is common with ptsd and bipolar disorder cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be very successful in helping with that if you havent tried it theres a book by david burns called feeling good: the new mood therapy that i love that was our curriculum when i was in the hospital its also very effective with depression and anxiety :),1
you dont have to serve in the military to have ptsd do not quit taking your meds without talking to your doctor to help fight stomach upset try taking it with food but call your dr regardless,1
you can only live in the momenttry not to think about next time instead focus on the moment you are in right nowthey say one day at a time but the truth is its one moment at a timethunk about your babies and know they need youthey will always need you i cry on my dogs shoulder all too oftenand i also fear calling any hot lines because like you what would i sayi kept it all inside for fear of losing my children if anyone found outbut recently i confided in the last person i thought i would get support from and itd a slow process but a huge release ive always feared being judged as ive had a pretty good life yet ive always been suicidal since i was 8 or 9i dont know why just have beenand not knowing is ok tooojust find a person you can trust and open up to themor even post like you did here thats why we are hereto help others not judge! i am thankful you are here and that you had the courage to speak outits nice knowing youre not alone ♡,0
when you feel suicidal but still have doubts call your local mental health center or er of the nearest hospital they know what to do,0
thank god your still here with us sharing your story! i will pray for you and tell you it will get better! there is so many people feeling this way day in day out who dont talk about it! so thank you for opening up! believe me someone needed to hear this today including myself! i struggle all the time but it helps when i know i am not alone! thank you and i am glad your still here!,0
you can worry about that one day when it comes for now all that matters is you are still here,0
i am prescribed it for sleep not getting enough sleep causes my anxiety to highten and then i cant sleep so it a vicious cycle so yes it makes you tired,1
i was taking the 150 but they put me on the 300 and ive been having to break them up ive been noticing at night some leg restlessness with this dose so im hoping i can switch back once my medicaid goes through to the pharmacy cause i didnt experience it till i got those :/,0
im on 200mg at night makes me so hungry after ive taken it i could eat the furniture also blocked nose and restless legs,0
i used to take 600mg every night i couldnt wake up i couldnt go to school i couldnt remember shit and it gave me horrible restless foot syndrome like to the point im talking asleep but my foot needed to be moving id cry every night i stopped taking that shit its not worth it,0
8kg i put on now im fuckd in sweet land shake it off,0
i was taking the lowest dose you can for my period i actually got worse because my lack of energy made me upset i had issues with school and have really been struggling to keep up on life due to it i stopped taking the friday ( my doctor said i could also take as needed ) i wont ever be taking that again,1
i take 600mg every nightcan get by on 6 hours sleep and work 50 hours a weekworks well for mewhen i was really struggling i was on 900mg,1
i take 600mg every night it stuffs my nose like fucking crazy the important thing is to take it right before you go to bed and dont stay up late or youll be half dead in the morning (energy wise) sometimes my blood pressure drops when i stand to walk and ill get insanely dizzy have to sit back down i tried going off it a couple times doing so made me highly sensitive to lights i find it more therapeutic taking it than not taking iti cant sleep without it which sets off mania im bipolar 1 with ultra rapid cycling,1
yes and it was absolutely horrible changed doctors who then changed my meds afta awhile and now im on an even keel,1
i take it 3 times a day and yes it does tend to make me sleepy but most the time its better to take it and be sedated to a point then dealing with the irritability and mania that i have without it,1
my anxiety panic attacks and irritability are so bad that i have to take it 3 times a day once in the morning when i get up once around lunch time and once again at bedtime,1
the higher the dosethe worse tbe restlegs legs nothing like being exhausted and unable to lay down i was on it for years the extended release version helped the restless legs,1
it gives me restless legs and dont even make me sleepy,0
seroquel is known for being sedating i was never irritable or confrontational on it but i suppose it is possible,0
its suppose to help me with sleeping but sometimes i doubt it i also take a quarter in the morning which leaves me feeling flat and tired,1
i hate the restless legs i get when i start to fall asleep,1
i didnt take it long enough to become irritable and confrontational but it made me dead tired i would sleep 13-14 hours and still find it hard to function stopped taking it very quickly,1
hi jenni! im on two types of seroquel i take 50mg slow release and 50mg of instant release i tried taking slow release in the morning (i take the instant release at night) and it just made me sooooo tired so i just started taking it at night with my other ones! works wonders how long have you been on seroquel? the first month or so for me was awful i had countless panic attacks and i was never happy eventually it worked out for me! hopefully it does for you too!! im no doctor but i hope it helps! good luck let me know how you go! xx,1
im on seroquel "extended release" (xr) 600 mg/day maybe its the extended release that never made me tired or feel any irritability,0
yup that was me i got told if this is me on meds i was better off without them i wanted to give it more time and then the warnings at work and the car crash done then tried lamictal felt amazing within a week! day 6 rash started gave it a few more days but it got worse and my dr called me in immediately it was the bad one that can turn life threatening done again tried geodon next day 3 pancreatic episode (i have recurring pancreatitis) so done again,0
same and without it i just cant function it keeps my moods stable my head clear enough to function daily and i know if i stopped taking it all that would change for the worst  other than dry mouth and sometimes of late restless legs im happy to be taking it it gave me my life back and my families too xx,0
ive been taking seroquel for yearsregular not xr i was on 300mg but got restless leg syndrome so bad i had to drop it to 200mg which helped otherwise i love it helps me sleep i notice when i forget to take it,1
it is simply a mood stabilizer basically for me it slows my brain down enough to recognize my "illogical thoughts" or that i am in an episode when things get stressful my body still responds to it to anxiety and exhaustion is one of those things could you be going through something that is more stressful then normal? has this occurred the whole year or just in moments?,0
i was only on small doses and i had to stop because i fell asleep at the wheel of my car the drowsiness was extreme i couldnt function i was irritable but i put that down to my bipolar not being stable meds react with different people in different ways,1
seroquel gave me horribly violent nightmares and yes i experienced some aggressive feelings,0
i have bp 2 and it is often missed and diagnosed as depression anxiety because most people seek help during depressive phases and these can be more obvious the hypomania a person can come across as be really energetic or irritable and anxious agitated fixated or obssessed with something and then lasts for a few weeks it generally doesnt involve losing touch with reality or lack of insight / self awareness as with mania the cycling between hypomania and depression is generally more frequent in bp2 and can be just as difficult to manage because of this frequent mood changes in fact to be diagnosed with bp1 a person only ever has to have 1 episode of mania and sometimes they never have another one,0
generally: type 1: severe episodes of manic (at least one) and depressive episodes type 2: hypomanic episodes (at least one) and severe depressive episodes there are other types of bipolar disorder that no one talks about it like cyclothymic disorder is a mild version of bp2 with mild hypomanic and mild depressive episodes i have been diagnosed with cyclothymia although i feel im bp2 at times it feels like living on the edge it frustrates me sometimes i feel i just want depression to hit hard i lose it all but i cant it just makes my anxiety levels very high sometimes it feels im hanging in mid-air not sure when im going to fall and at the same time wishing i could fall and be done with it,0
i got bi polar 1 and it sucks  i also have ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression adhd suicidal ideation so its hard for me to explain sorry but people on here are doing a very good job of explaining it ,1
i am bipolar 2 i have more lows than highs and my highs are mostly irritability with a lot of energy i believe bipolar 1 is more highs than lows and their highs are extreme,1
louise thank you im more manic most the time now but with my meds and therapy ive learned to recognize it and "try" to control it being that i now have many anxiety issues plus some ocd im struggling but doing my best i just do deep breathing along with walking away from the situation till i get my center again long 40 yrs it has been ,0
in simple terms bipolar i is the more severe of the 2 you experience extreme highs where things are completely irrational and severe lows where things couldnt get much worse bipolar 2 is not so severe but just as real and hard to deal with,0
if you are unsure you can call your pharmacy and ask they are good with stuff like that,0
1 see a psychologist a lot can be achieved (and i was very cynical) through letting a stranger into your head psychologists are not medical doctors (although they can be also) as such but work on therapy by assisting with identifying issues patterns challenging ideas that you are set on etc you may need to see one or two different ones before you find one youre comfortable with 2 dont talk yourself or a doctor into a diagnosis bipolar is normal just an extreme version of normal where your ups and downs are more common and more severe dont think youre sicker than you are but if you actually are then dont worry because there are heaps of different options out there 3 drugs work different on different people some get benefits some dont some get side effects some dont i stopped counting at about a dozen different drugs ive been on over the years to find an improvement and then to fine tune it dont expect the first pill to be the silver bullet and dont be afraid to tell your doctor if youre not happy with something youre on try to document things as best you can eg felt super down no reason tonight sleeping patterns are off felt lethargic this morning im getting xyz side effects etc its hard to recall everything when youre right in front of your doctor 4 if you are bipolar then antidepressants are unlikely to fix your problem you will also need a mood stabilizer or anti psychotic (not necessarily for psychosis they can be used to bring mood peaks down and to improve sleep) 5 someone once told me "medication is the ladder correct diagnosis is the step toward it but you are responsible for climbing it" the translation here is that you will have to put in effort to identify and fix problems or if there are none (and honestly who has no oriblems!!) then look at positive changes in your life electronic devices off before bed (as i type this its 231am in australia - oops) force yourself to go to bed at a reasonable time force yourself to rest even if you cant fall asleep - try not to get wound up about not sleeping and just enjoy the chillout) force yourself to get up at a reasonable hour incorporate some exercise into your day (an early morning walk is a great way to get yourself out of bed early to feel good straight away and to have achieved something before youve even started what would be your normal day 6 watch your diet sugars stimulants (coffee) high calorie and high-gi foods lend themselves to buzz and crash scenarios 7  the g in gp is for general it means they have more knowledge than the average population on most medical topics but no specialist knowledge you should see a specialist in the case of this illness that would be a psychiatrist dont be ashamed its normal people get sick its an illness youre not crazy or faulty 8 share find some friends you can talk to about it i guarantee theres practically no-one you see or work with that would say no if you said you werent doing well and would like a chat 9 dont get caught in the this is me trap yes your illness is closely linked to your personality and something you cant change but that doesnt mean you have to spend all your time on depression sites or reading/sharing depressive memes i find that makes the situation worse n- you feel at first like its good that soneone relates to you but on the whole youre just surrounding yourself with negativity focus on positive things positive changes and youll not only get better but youll actually be better than many normal people because you will learn a lot about yourself other people and tools for everyday life,0
get a referal to a psychiatrist i was diagnosed around 21 (mother also bp) dont worry you will find the rights meds but antidepressants alone are no good for bp as they can get you manic if you are bp you will also need a mood stabaliser such as lithium good luck ,1
emily dickinson was far from successful she was a recluse due to her struggles and her work was largely unpublished during her lifetime,0
this is something i find myself repeating with people who are newly diagnosed or not understanding of the illness you can still live your dream you will still have your passion and joy it dosent go away but it can make things harder learn your body track your moods pay attention to yourself and youll find what works and what dosent for you even if you can only manage to work on something 10 minutes a day thats 10 minutes of work more than the day before i had always wanted to write fiction i was never encouraged or supported and when i broke under life pressure and my mental illness i felt it time to kill the dream then i met my wonderful partner who found my notes and half written stories and told me to keep going it was slow and i wont lie hard some days i finished my first novella after almost 3 years of labor and am now working on the sequel im honestly not the best writer things are sometimes hard for me to convey (i had 3 amazing friends beta reading to help) i may never make a full living off my works but that was never the point i have stories in my head screaming for life and i have a duty to provide it,0
people helping need to really understand this it is so easy to put on a mask when leaving the house for short periods of time but thats not the whole story and most pain is below the surface it takes allot of strength for the one being helped and the helper to go below the surface it can be messy and stressful but in the end it can become very therapeutic have empathy not sympathy,0
i know your your struggle shawna seriously i have had bi polar depression and anxiety and all my life it is and can be a very hard road at times i to have come so very close a few times in ending my life  and i wanted this so much but then i got a second wind and thought dam it this isnt going to beat me or take my life my life is to precious to give up and throw away just like that i have just came out of a very dark horrible place of depression cause i had to and had to pull myself up out of bed find my motivation it wasnt easy be i had to for my own mental state we didnt ask for this but is the hand we were dealt so we cant just throw in the hand we have to focus on what we really need and want to be doing it can be crippling when the bodys muscles are seized up through being bed ridden but we must move forward shawna keep telling yourself you are not giving in you want to find your balance in your medication with the doctors help and please tell your self your exsistence in this world matters and yes you do matter we love you and all of us on this page feel where you are comming from life wasnt made to be easy honey but we all need your presence in this life you matter your family matter and care and love you and all of us on this page want you to tackle this barstard depression etc and say no you are not winning bottom line we all love you if you only but knew this please stay with us and help us aswell thank you shawna xoplease stay strong now *,0
self talk they tell me is the best therapy talk sometimes i dont understand how? im currently super depressed right now and my last two counseling sessions thats all ive heard self talk good luck the struggle is real,0
i thought i was reading about myself this has always been one of my biggest fears i have a history of suicide attempts and have always failed i am fearful i will not be strong enough to resist it has happened many times before keep on talking about this bring it to the forefront for discussion sometimes i dread going to sleep for fear of waking up the next day in my eyes just writing what you have shows you are aware of your situation,0
so proud of you for being so strong last night i have been where you are i was not so strong as you but i survived the guilt still haunts me today take it one day at a time the feeling will get better i promise,0
you prove you are a strong person because you are here to share this story with us we all are stronger than "normal" people because each day is another day where they might find stressful its double for us never doubt your problems are too petty to talk to someone aboutwe are all importantand we are all strong even in our weakest moments stay strong and you indeed are not alone in this battle daily❤,0
i am so so proud of you for talking yourself down its not an easy thing to do i understand your fears for future episodes but focus on the positive you managed to say "no screw you" and that is the hardest thing to do make yourself a hot drink turn on a movie and look after yourself and relax you did so well ❤️ ,0
i have a huge issue with motivation i cant get going and the thought of doing some things gives me a feeling of dread sounds pathetic i know but thats the way it is with me i feel flat most of the time but at least im not depressed my medication is working ok but dont know what to do about motivation,0
although i dont look miserable when im depressed i tend to look blank or perhaps disinterested people pick up on this and avoid me,0
i was hospitalized 15 days through police intervention the doctor finally told me to answer just the questions directly as he was trying to decide if i was depressed or bipolar i am bipolar with depression that does not mean i dont have manic episodes also steve wajda is correct bipolar meds are a combination of many types some with harsh side effects and costly previously for 25 years my diagnosis was chronic depression with anxiety i eventually became someone who i did not know existedvery angry and destructive along with manic spending sprees my children became afraid of me as i look back at my history i can identify times when i was definitely showing symptoms of bipolar severe your awareness is a positive attribute and do not give up on getting the proper diagnosis and help be persistent have someone close to you verify your situation also with your psychiatrist or therapist my husband did for me (though i hated him at the time for doing so),1
always difficult when dearling with depression and anxiety i would not suggest another diagnosis until depression and anxiety are stable once stable coaching of how to read what your body is telling you; coaching of ways to increase strength coaching for limiting drama-fears might even stablize depression and anxiety more i know someone who has stablized d & a and doesnt show any signs of bipolar today bless youbreatherslow down but sleep breathe do what you love,1
i also use to think i had schizophrenia because of the rage that was inside me it used to make me that angry that i would attack myself and self destruct as much as i could and the thoughts that ran through my mind were so sadistic and quite sickening but it was just part of my borderline and came with my rage fits im past that now i no longer feel suicidal when i have outbursts and no longer self destruct or self harm i can control my moods 10 times better than i used to all because i got the right help and the right treatment for my problem meds ever worked for me so i forced myself off of them im now med free for my problems but i still take mertazapine occasionally for sleep as i have bad insomnia i found the only mer that ever did help with my anxiety depression and mood stabilisation was mertazapine all the others i tried made things worse harder to deal with or turned me dumb seroquel for instance literally caused me to start stuttering and losing my mind i couldnt even reply to someone when they asked me my name or date of birth because i couldnt remember i started feeling dumb and embarrassed so j stopped taking it and writhing 3 weeks i was myself again no more stuttering or forgetfulness but all meds work for different people i just dont ever reconnect seroquel to people because of my effects its trial and error with everything whether it be pills therapy or finding the right person to diagnose you when one fails try and try again goodluck with finding the root of your problems so you can get the right help that you need :) i hope you have some understanding soon,1
i have bpd and i used to think it was bipolar because i couldnt control my anger and would constantly have major rage fits and outbursts but i was diagnosed with bpd and im now in dialectical behavioural therapy for it to learnt to control my emotions it has saved me from myself i suffer from constant anxiety and depression along with unstable moods and constant fear of abandonment its hard to deal with but now that i know what my problem is learning about it comes easily and is easier for me to help myself but you need to be persistent with your psych and if they dont help you to find out your diagnosis than you need to keep trying with others until you find one that will diagnose you i tried and tried and i couldnt find the help i needed until one night when i took myself to hospital to the psych ward very suicidal they had a proper psych come in and sit with me for 3 hours asking me all these different questions about my past and present and my moods and anger troubles in a week he had me in proper therapy to figure out what was wrong with me and i was finally diagnosed ever since ive made it priority to learn about my diagnosis and do everything i can to make myself better and change the way my mind processes its hard so hard but the more i keep doing it the better im becoming i tried medication after medication councillor after councillor psychiatrist after psychiatrist until i finally found one that i liked and who gave proper time for me and made sure to do everything in her will to help me she started printing out modules of how to deal with distress intolerance and made me work through them and learn to control the way i react to my distressing situations made me work out what my triggers and warning signs were etc ive come so far in only 8-9 months and im proud of that but i know im not yet where i want to be and still have a long way to go but if it wasnt for me persisting to get help the right help i wouldnt be where i am today you just need to be persistent yet patient at the same time you will get there just keep trying and do your best to find both a psychiatrist and psychologist whom not only helps you to figure out your problems but also makes you feel comfortable and able to talk about everything and anything that could help diagnose you if you cant find one that helps you feel like youre getting somewhere with things go to the hospital and admit yourself for assessment i had to to get the right help you dont need to stay there its just for the right assessment instead of those k10 forms that doctors fill out to diagnose depression and anxiety and stuff its not that simple and it takes a long time to dig deep to figure out the problem it cant take 5 minutes just keep trying you will get there,1
mania or hypomania is what gives you the diagnosis for me it can be euphoria the world is a wonderful place and everybody is my friend it can also be rage irritability your behaviour can be reckless financially sexually even driving the car you may believe you are the fountain of all knowledge you can accomplish anything you are unstoppable and that can include talking sleep is a good indication of mania you can get by with very little sometimes none,0
yes thats what my general doctor is worried about with my past history,1
i have been told all i could take was zoloft im 7 months pregnant and have been on zoloft for a while doctor recently upped the dose for me since i was getting bad again i have a mild bi polar disorder depression anxiety and ptsd zoloft keeps me stable right now,1
i agree with everyone everyone is different and responds differently to different meds it took me years to find what worked for me im bipolar 2 with anxiety and ptsd my psychiatrist has me on cymbalta geodon topamax and valium but everyone is different find what works for you and your symptoms,1
i take effexor wellbutrin epival and seroquel bp2 and anxiety disorder,1
i was dignosed bi polar with bpd 10 years ago now i have not been able to find medication that didnt make me feel like doing self harm i gave up on psychs and therapists and trying to figure out meds i try to manage my mental health myself i struggle on a daily basis i do not recommend this path to anyone,1
its taken me 16 years to find the right doctor and right combination im on prestiq and rexulti both of which i couldnt afford without the medication program through the pharmacy at the mental health clinic i go to i have severe anxiety and depression and since being on this combo i finally feel normal after many years of struggling you will get there just dont give up,1
everyone  and everyones brain is different and what works for others may not work for you it will be trial and error recently after new clinical depressive episode i was put on sertraline by a new doctor and in two weeks i felt much much worse i went back and insisted on going back on to what had worked for me before  citalaprim now three weeks later by brain has stopped doing the negative stuff and rumenating and the anxiety has left me so try to describe to you doctor as accurately as you can your symptoms and the degree you experience them the meds are of course only part of the solution life changes and diet are far more beneficial although not discounting the role of meds in stabilising the worst vessels of brain/ emotional illness,1
my pet hate with bpd is the fear of rejection and the sense of abandonment that can be so intense whether founded on fact or fiction,0
actually i have this issue i call this more to do with paranoia that can stem from any mental disorder and not bpd in itself this is not only bpd and from the this is written it comes across strongly as if this is only bpd and a symptom,1
it is one of several characteristics of bpd its not saying this is the only symptom of bpd or that only people with bpd experience this just that this is a common to a lot of people with bpd and can be very destructive as well as upsetting for both others and for person with bpd especially as quite often is not based on reality but due to bpd and its effect on individuals ability to process and regulate emotions and interpret other peoples,0
because it is still so little understood under researched and u set funded and its frightening - duh! we need to stop calling it mental illness and call it brain illness we dont call people with dementia or alzheimers mentally ill so why label other brain located illnesses under this useless label,0
also i really think it is the name attached to it humans are afraid of illness and when they hear the word it can tend to make one feel uncomfortable or powersless and its human nature to fear what we dont understand,0
im not really afraid of it im more afraid of what others think of it that may sound well how it sounds to another hehe and yes that caused me little fear i just want to be loved like everyone else even you,0
i know exactly how you feel i would never give advice or offer hope as i am conscious that every sufferer is unique just wanted to share that after mis-read medication i am now 3 weeks back on medication i have used before - citalaprim - and it appears to be working for me again and lifted my mood enough to be able to get up face the day and do things and laugh i hope your fog clears even a little if not on any meds or if you are and they are not working go back to your gp also sleep/ insomnia/anxiety meditations by lina grace have helped me a great deal as well as other insights on youtube - andrew solomon on ted talks talking about depression others too the loneliness  or sense of it of the experience even if we have partners beside us is i found one of the hardest symptoms look for and seek the moments of respite however short there is hope in them and in drawing them out to longer experiences do what makes you smile relax switch off distract you from your dark thoughts - e en if writing on this fb page i have started writing every day even if only a couple of sentences - my autobiography- which will never be published thoughts with you,1
in a world that teaches you self doubt liking yourself is a rebellious actgo on do it like yourself you need to be on your own sideif you think others dont like you the least you can do is like yourself! please! learn to adore who you areyou of all people should love yourself more than anyone else loves you rebel you can!,0
oh man how i have struggled with this with a very close friend of mine he isolates himself when he is depressed and i am an over giver one thing ive found helpful in maintaining healthy boundaries is to journal what im thinking and feeling during those times when im really worried about him check in regularly but in a balanced way then when he seeks support you can let him know some of the things you were thinking,0
im an isolator myself anxiety & depression for over a year now i just wish to be left alone and for my friends to respect that unfortunately i think theyve forgotten about me im not ready to see them in person but it would be nice if they reached out every now & then,0
i wouldnt like to judge because ive been in that bad place before but i hope you dont feel pressured into anything seems a bit like he wants more from your relationship dont feel guilted into anything and remember this isnt your responsibility but also try to help in a way that isnt detrimental to your own mental health x x,0
i am not a professional and dont know the exacts of your situation but i will speak as someone who similar to your friend pushed everyone away with the intention to die alone he is not thinking straight while sick and desperately needs you and needs help even if he is mad at you now if he can get better hell understand and youll be closer for it he is hurting you to push you away not because he is actualy mad staying in his life is a start though may not be enough if you are able to contact his therapist or doctor please do so and let them know what is going on and ask what you can do to help more try and find a way to ease his isolation as best you can try to get him to engage in activities with you there is also a program in many areas refered to as a baker act i recomend it only as a last ditch effort if he is showing signs of self harm or immediate danger it is drastic and harsh but if it saves his life it is worth it,0
i have a major deal of it for almost 40 years if you leave him isolated he will go nuts and may do the wrong choice isolating i have done it is like being in your own jail!: ((( its horrible,0
absolutely i struggle at work so by the time i get home im in bed watching tv by 6:30 i cant stand being anywhere else i sent to dose for an hr or two then wake but its still better to be asleep even for a little while awake,0
yeah definitely i have depression and anxiety and i often fall asleep around 2 3pm constantly worrying about things makes us so tired,1
its horrible isnt it i have all these ideas and thoughts in my head about how i could improve my life and get better but when it comes down to it im stuck and nothing changes,0
this is great but as yenz has said its so hard to do i would really love to do this anybody else struggle with it? :/,0
i struggle to do all ov them lol just having sum1 to talk to with out them thinking am mad is bad anuf,0
anxiety attacks are not only about fear,1
i had a massive panic attack once when out with my sister saw someone who looked like my abusive biological mom i told her i needed to find somewhere to hide for a bit she said she could see the panic on my face she helped me find a hideaway then stood outside it to protect me while i got it under control when i came out she just asked if i was ok and we went on doing what we were doing b,0
panic attacks are real  if you have never had one then you dont know  true or not they happen everyday ,0
except my husband actually is leaving me worst nightmare coming true but you know what? i dont think my anxiety caused it i think i sensed it and my anxiety skyrocketed,1
and from the outside its hard for those who care to tell that its happening to those with anxiety then there is the person who is dependent on one person (as is my down syndrome daughter) to take care of them and knows that when that person is gone its very likely that one one else will really give a damn about them that is not anxiety that is real and tragic and there is no cure or pill for real combine the 2nd situation with anxiety and its crushing,0
am glad you have the opposite of what happened to me never had that in my life and when i thought i might have itthe person leftinsulted me and threatened to throw me in jail i would sell my soul to get just one person from your life in mine,0
serious anxiety seriously hurts,1
bi-polar with anxiety stress phobias is a bitch depression mixed in and life can be a muttha fricker friends and family hanging in there is very tuff and stressful but believe me its appreciated and so important to we who suffer all i have to say be well,0
i have anxiety ptsd bipolar1 mania which is,1
hello la rhonda im so sorry for what youre going through i understand the struggle and the feelings behind the sentiment and i know that its not easy id like to share these articles with you that has helped many faced their challenges in life in a better perspective hope youll find it helpful to your circumstance as well any question? please send me a message ill be glad to accommodate please take care ❤ ,0
i pushed everyone away and i got pushed out its my fault i know but i never lied to anybody that tried to get close to me physically or mentally they had no idea it was that bad it always looks easy to handle in books but when faced directly on with this issue people get scared they dont know how i will act day to day so they walk on eggshells around me which i never picked up on people dont come near me because i am unpredictable i have never known this till recently i have no way to repair the damage that has been afflicted to the countless peoplei try to fix it but i make it alot worse i have nobody to turn to because i am afraid of damaging them as well,0
this fucking suck this is one of my main problem i hate anxiety! i wish theres no pstd so i wouldnt act like this! this is very hard to change sometimes,0
it is now saturday 5:31 am i havent been able to sleep since thursday welcome to anxiety it will be fun they said! they lied can i return it?,1
i have ptsd bi polar high anxiety depression adhd how in the hell is that going to work for me wait it wont 1 - 1 1/2 hours aday is my norm,1
what utter bollocks when anxiety strikes u just dont think of any of these things and this is the problem anxiety isnt funny its a real serious issue these are like telling someone who needs crutches oh if you do x y or z you wont need them so stop telling people how to control anxiety im totally pissed off with this and now removing this post and your page,0
if only all that crap worked you cant sleep you dont want to eator over eat and all wrong things comfort food talk to someone? people dont want to know about your anxiety issuesor so ive found so i keep to myself now & dont talk to anyone!,0
if it were that easy none of us would have anxiety disorders!,1
people are more likely to accept a physical illness than a mental illness because major depression bpd and other mental conditions affect personality which can be seen and is most likely unpredictable in other words it scares them,1
i dont blame ya it hurt so bad for me to deal with depression and anxiety ,1
this is quite simple let me put it this way what do most people fear the most? the answer is - their brain shutting down and forced to be dependent they fear what they dont understand i will never understand the stigma the brain should be the most focused on- it is vital to running your body are you people with me?,0
rapid cycling is the worst and really leaves you tired and confused i have no answer for you as i still suffer from it and it has never calmed down really even with the meds i do a lot of dbt with myself and that has helped,1
and also sometimes it could have something to do with throid condtion on the sucide thoughts and depression maybe get it checked i was having some of the same issues and found out my throid was low but i also have ptsd bipolar anxiety and socail anxieety,1
so sorry to hear how bad you feel acute mood swings are really scary and lead to confusion and fear apart from counselling have you thought of consulting a neurologist? just a thought!,0
i have times where i go through moods very quickly for me its most likely related to borderline personality disorder i do not have bipolar although i have heard that for some people with bipolar cycling that rapidly isnt unusual this being unusual for you its probably related to some sort of extra stress going on at the moment if youve got a psych you really need to let them know about this if you havent already,0
guess what got me out of rapid cyclingas not to sound religious as im notbut i talked to a higher power and expressed all of my moods to that power i asked for help i spent most of my day just talking to the higher power expressing crying sharingit was like a light switch that changed thingsim actually able to have a job now and work whereas before i was too emotional to worktoday i am seen as the reliable one at workthe go to girl through talking to something or someone bigger than mea higher forcewhatever you want to call itnot medsnot reading some religious book but honestly just giving all of my fears hopes and dreams to god goddess whatevertry it you have nothing to lose im bipolar type 1 and guess whatall my anxiety and instability has disappearedmost of it anywaythere is a cosmic awesome energy force that is able to help you call on it,1
ok heres my spin diet is a major factor in depression and anxiety this is an awful truth but unless a decent diet is addressed the body is in a constant state of alert either to get rid of toxins parasites or high levels of blood sugar loads of research has been done on the gut brain connection and is well worth the reading doctors are happy to prescribe an instant fix but it never addresses the long term well being of a person just the now i am not selling anything or trying to argue a point with anyone its just this i have personally suffered anxiety and chronic depression on and off all my life i started on a new diet based on no grains and no sugar this grew to include night shades and read meat i eat berries and greek style yogurt for breakfast most days( frozen berries are in supermarkets for cheap) or eggs and salad each day i try to eat one raw meal and one cooked meal if you are at all interested please pm and i will explain furtheri take no medications at all and i have support in 12 step groups and close friends i am so happy to be in control of my dieti have lost weight and gained my self respectawesomemy grocery bill is xlnt i have helped many people to be free of gut problems and hence lead happier lives probiotics are useless if not addressing a diet peace to all who read this jb,1
im sorry to hear that maybe some cbd oil would help i know it has helped me there is no thc in cbd oil that might trigger him im bipolar 2 ptsd and severe anxiety,1
i worry pro-actively things that i know are never going to happen get a fair amount of my "black dog"  obsessive anxietywhatever youd like to call it,0
yesssss vicious horrible circle bailey morrell,0
lisa spivy azpilcueta kevin spivy if i had a nickel for every time you kids saidmom you just worry too muchand a dime for everyone else that said thati would be richer than trump,0
that sounds like my friend at moment about anxiety and depression,1
anxiety is not knowing what you want in your life,0
it is so truelam constantly told to stop worrying about everything but they have no insight into the powerlessness of anxietyl guess thats why l work hard using the skills lve been taught and do a "workout" twice a day using my pacifica app and a great app called smiling mind they give practical helps to give me some empowerment over damm anxiety,1
i hate my meds weve been trying for years and just cant get it worked out my bain is just wore out and im tired of it but i am terrified to go off of them ive always b÷n medicated ugh,0
i fought against meds for so long not really cuz of the stigma but because i get addicted to things very easy and i worried i wouldnt be able to live off them then i started to have massive panic attacks several times a day and my husband begged me to please talk to the doctor about meds so i started zoloft i got damn lucky zoloft worked for me right away i went on zoloft mainly because i was trying to get pregnant and its safe for pregnancy i was very lucky they worked and make me stable,1
christopher l snead they are scary it took my 5 years to find the right now meds ow i have no bad side effects it was worth the trial amd error,1
meds scare me ive taken them before and the side effects are terrible,1
ive tried mmj but it didnt help me at all it was a strain for insomnia and depression and it helped neither,1
and this is why cannabis should be legal because everyone is on horrible medications right now,1
buspar has been a godsent for my anxiety ativan only put me to sleep,1
i use it during the daytime for anxiety doesnt make you sleepy but calms your nerves,1
i took this while i was pregnant for a very brief amount of time it gave me serious insomnia and for about 2 hours after every dose i felt like my anxiety was actually worse,1
my dr put me on escitalopram for my depression and buspirone for my anxiety from what ive heard buspirone is for anxiety i would double check with your dr but other than that buspirone isnt that great the only way to break out of anxiety is to challenge yourself to talk to a person who youve never met before a day small talk like hi or how your day is going i usually do this when i go to the store and talk a bit with the cashiers when im checking out,0
i took wellburtin for a little bit it made me so irritable ( spelling ) i never took the other one,1
what are you on these for? anxiety and depression? it takes at least 6 weeks to kick in still a mood stabilizer like lithium that handles both very well might be the better way to go slow release tablets 900mg a day 3 x 300mg tabs,1
very much sounds like anxiety attacks- but would recommend you see your health care professional :-),1
anxiety symptoms sweetheart you sound so much like mebut i have severe anxiety panic disorder i dont leave my home go see your doctor and explain everything you said to us you are definitely experiencing some anxiety there a doctor will talk with you and let you know and help you treat it feel better soon chin up and see that doctor :),1
make a list each day of things you need to get done and check them off when you wake you can see whats left to do just a bit of organization and youll get the reality check you need to bring down your anxiety,1
seems like anxiety symptoms,1
it sounds like anxiety to meits the symptoms,1
i became quickly addicted to benzos after two weeks when i didnt know about their side effects it took me six months to get off be careful with addictive anti anxiety meds its probably better that you dont take them in the long run i used depakote to get off of klonopin it worked really well completely solved the withdrawal problems i was having,1
a good dr will only prescribe benzodiazepines as a last resort and only for short periods of time due to their addictive nature most antidepressants are also good for anxiety in long term busperine is also less additive and good for longterm management of anxiety beta blockers can help with physical symptoms drugs like valium ativan should be used sparingly,1
my doc gives with no problem she does however restrict to 15 a month i only use them as my rescue tabs for severe anxiety i am on 3 anxiety tabs a day which keeps me quite stable,1
you need to go to hospital you cant stop suddenly your blood pressure please go to hospital,0
this seems to be the trend right now if youre lucky enough to even find a psychiatrist & one thats taking patients its very difficult to be taken seriously in my area you either got the docs that throw anything at you but mostly the ones who do the bare minimum ive been relying on herbal supplements like kava kava or valerian root to help my anxiety,1
thats a shame jessica because if you have a disorder that causes you to need it and are not abusing it you should be helped my doctor is a really good listener i was diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety panic disorder he wanted me on xanax but because of the junkies xanax has been removed from australia and doctors do not give out xanax but im really really bad so he wants me on increased dosages of valium he said it may take up to 5 each day to just calm me down my doctor cares and listens and a good doctor will look at your history your diagnosis previous suicide attempts (they look over everything) and look at you today and tell you what you will need if he/she flat out said no thats not very good if she gave a reason well yeah its a hard one yes certain prescribed drugs are addictive but under the watchful eye of a good doctor and regular visits and taking them as prescribed for your condition you are safe because the doc can ween you off safely when its time so sorry your having a shit time candy,1
unfortunately lots of doctors are that way because ativan can be addictive and they do not want us relying on it im supposed to use my techniques i learned at therapy to combat panic attacks and depression,1
is she going to wean you off? simply not renewing can be very dangerous potential side effects of cold turkey are seizures hallucinations and psychotic episodes lesser side effects can be anxiety dizziness increased heart rate and headaches if your doctor is forcing you to quit cold turkey get in to a different psychiatrist immediately,1
rest  proper diet and attempting to stay free of stress are key in recovery and maintaining a healthy balance,0
yes my mother denied my bipolar ptsd and anxiety for years she has finally accepted it but still questions my medications whenever i see her which is like 1 week out of the year,1
i think fear of the unknownmyths and stigma has a lot to answer for,0
was on prozac but it was horrible !!!! love my son not pregnancy also b safe with everyone knowing ur issues my son doesnt live with me bcuz judge said no fixing crazy yeah,0
i too felt wonderful while pregnant! i chose to stay on low doses of medications i tried going off but couldnt all 3 of my kids are healthy there are stresses wheb pregnant and obviously worse with a baby when your time is right you will know it you dont have to have a baby if its not right for you my anxiety got worse then better everyone is different tho and now i constantly worry about being a good mother and doing the right thing good luck sweetie,1
i have bipolar 1 and chose not to have kids- worried that my moods irritability you name it would not make me a good mom and did worry about going without meds i am 60 now and do not regret my decision,1
i am bipolar 2 and i stopped my meds when pregnant i was happier while pregnant and no mood swings my psych said no meds were safe while pregnant i know they say some are but its risk versus benefit my psych said after my baby was born my moods were out of control that was the hardest part but meds helped and with time my body went back to normal,0
i have a 2 year old and a 1 month old i took buspar for a short period of time during my pregnancy but it caused me severe insomnia (which i had no problem before starting the meds) i was on lamictal when i found out i was pregnant and had to stop treatment my psych (who is very experienced and well known in the mental medical community) wasnt comfortable with any other options said he would try lithium but it wasnt something he practiced so i would have to sign a waiver stating im aware of the possibility of complications/defects so i refused and went without meds i turned to aromatherapy orange is one of my favorite essential oils to help promote good mood but everyone is different both times i became pregnant it was unplanned though it happened both times during the spring which is a lower stress period for my cycles,1
im sure hes well aware that he needs to be with his son and handle his finances smh his post is pretty much saying he is struggling with that and would like some advice and support seeing that this is what this page is for your ignorance on everyones posts pisses me off lady why you here? to tell ppl to just calm down and shut up?? if things were so simple wed just do it wouldnt we?? ugh! anyway to the man who wrote this post fonzie it truly must be hard being a father and struggling to provide the weight of the world hey? im so sorry your going through this im sure you are trying your best sometimes the government can help in financial situations depending what country you live seeing your doctor may help you some light medication and maybe some therapy mate sounds like a tough time for you and i hope your relationship issues can be resolved its hard but never give up,0
get on some stabilizer meds for anxiety you have to be with your son and handle finances,1
it took a lot of time to try to teach my boyfriend about bpd after my last stay in the hospital things have been getting better and we have begun to communicate in ways that are helping! there are struggles but we manage,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar anxiety and depression before getting pregnant with my second child pregnancy i took my lamictal and other meds and my psychiatrist said it was fine being a mom with these things has its ups and downs and good days and bad days like most things however a good strong support system and the right meds make it possible and worth it good luck!,1
total balls statement! wish i could decide not to let my anxiety fuck my life up sometimes!,0
this is offensive to people who already struggle with self-defeating thoughts this contributes to the stigma you say you are trying to fight,0
recovery isnt always a choice otherwise wed be able to instantly pull ourselves out of depressive states or anxiety attacks or panic attacks,0
why arent you on an atypical anti psychotic at night to rest? plus mood stabilizers to control anxiety and depression and benzodiazapines for spot relief,1
counselormy gp doesnt handle any of this i asked for anxiety meds and they dont want to do it till the lamictal starts doing its job but its not doing anything and my breakdowns are getting worse i dont know why they arent helping me i am making my next prescriber appt next week and gonna keep trying,1
i take 200mg lamictal in the morning along with 1mg estradiol 300mg ozcarbazepine and 2mg of tenex at night i still have my anxiety and depression swings so they added lorazepam/tenex 05mg double if i need for my outbreaks been on this cocktail for 2 yrs but still have my breakdowns it does take time for your meds to stabilize you but sounds like you need to keep on your anxiety meds! keep explaining to them have them read your journals finding a doctor/therapist is hard but finding one that can relate to you is so important for you i call mine  my best friend  please hang in there and keep plugging along you can win this battle im here (not an expert) but have 50 yrs of experience battling this disorder talk to them ask them how can i get you to listen to me!,1
i take 600mg lithium 150mg lamotrigine which is fairly new also 175mg quitiapine 10 - 15 mg diazepam and 7mg zoplicone a sleeping tablet i take them all at night and when i take them i almost instantly feel soo dizzy and if i dont lie down immediately im staggering about the place yet im having real difficulty sleeping i think its got something to do with lamotrigine but since my psychiatrist left after 9 years all i get is locums and they dont seem to listen and just up lamotrigine and quitiapine i dont think im on the right meds but they dont really listen and im scared to rock the boat incase they give me something that will increase my weight so im in a catch 22 as ive not been in hospitalfor two years and dont want to go back but my mood is more down than up x,0
the lamictal is a good long term preventative for depression but not so good short term- have you tried a mood stabilizer like tegretol or lithium or do you have just depression? due to recent law changes prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs like sleep meds and anxiety meds now are strictly controlled and they just do not give as many of them maybe you need an antidepressant as well,1
that is horrible im sorry to hear that,0
they told me this was a mood stabilizeri told her i need something for in the moment breakdowns and she said lets get this up to a good dosage first and see if you need something after thati am scared and not very authoritive,0
this is one of those platitudes i hate and wish people would stop using time and love doesnt always make things better and when they dont get better it makes the person that was already struggling feel like they must be doing something wrong or arent good enough to figure it all out empty platitudes make things worse,0
im horrible with meds i dont take them or i take to many,1
i have a lot of meltdownsuncontrolled cryingthey just look at me like im stupid its things i cant control could be something littlemusicthinkingectim in my room 99 % of the dayi get depressed i cant get it through their head that its nothing i ever wanted in my lifetotal opposite of my old selfthey think its a jokeits no joke!,0
ive had a couple of them it is an all consuming feeling of fright i thank god i havent had any in forever it seems,0
its a living hell going through panic attact thay just come on with no warning if you ant had one then you dont know wot these people go through as i do as ive said its s living hell,0
they are horrible :(,0
a panic attack can only be understood by those who have had one frightening to say the least the fear of dieing can be very real,0
there is know way to describe the terror you feel when your having a full blown panic attack unless youve had one,0
everyday struggles for those of us that have mental health problems,0
i can agree that a situation or a set of experiences is so jacked up that doing anything feels like like we are putting band aids on cancer i really do get this ive been plagued by this i often wished that depression would stop my heart and the lights would go out one last time the only resolution for this new year was go to war with my diagnosis no real choice alone last christmas day and felt cornered by the black snarling dogs of major depressive disorder i guess i snapped if i was going to take some punches i was certainly going to throw some from here on out it started with a written plan for the rest of my life step 1 get out that lumpy bed and wash myself that was a victory for me any progress i have made this year boils down to a three step process acceptance of the naked truth that the world is the way i find it careful choices about what i love to see happen taking action amidst great friction and discomfort im actually fighting now after years of being dormant,0
scary,0
i totally understand im 41 and this has just taken over my life much worse in the last 2 yrs i have all these same problems in my life i was voted "most likely to succeed" by my graduating class & used to excel at everything! its horrible now that if i shower ive accomplished something i dont have the answer; just want you to know youre not alone im currently home from work bcuz stress led me to getting mono ,0
might i suggest vippasanna meditation or at the very least practicing mindfulness? it helps against panic attacks,1
right now i am working pt but my job is seasonal for jackson hewitt as soon as tax season ends my job ends and i have to find something new its going to be hard trying to find something thats going to work with me the place i go for therapy is 30 minutes away from where i live so i barely have time to do anything but come home for a bit take care of my dogs and leave for work after my first session (which was monday) i was so upset and raw i ended up having a panic attack and i missed my shift,1
i was put back on xanax for the anxiety and panic attacks and latuda for bipolar my boss even took me to my initial appointment to see what therapy i needed she knew i how intense it was going to be but was still upset about me missing work im trying to stick it out until april 18th and ive applied for disability yesterday im just finding it hard to function after each session and have no idea how to clear my head without breaking down in public while working when all i want to do is go to bed,0
youll get through it itll take some time but youll get through it its not meant to be easy talk to your psych and see if he/she can give you anything for the panic attacks each session gets "easier" as you work through things and talk to your boss and let him know what youre dealing with when i finished my last in-patient time and had to go to php i came home the same way you described and it was hell and that was seven days a week so no breaks at all it sucked but it got easier as time went on (not trying to compare my situation to yours just trying to say i know where youre coming from),0
i have ssdi for bipolar i that was diagnosed 25 years ago i have had multiple hospital stays 5150s 5250s last time i was manic i got arrested twice for suspicion of being on meth they threw me in jail instead of taking me to mental health dumb ass cops but i digress ive also had a lot of health problems i guess it was just the combination of everything that got me approved on the first try that is the exception and not the rule though most people get denied 3 times and end up having to go to court its a long haul,1
bp2 gad ptsd insomnia panic disorder agoraphobia recently diagnosed with hashimotos after working 24 years havent worked the past three no disability,1
im 36 years old and my family literally has to lock me in sometimes because my bpd is flared the back privacy fence is screwed shut and the front gate can be locked i dont have a key im very irrational when im cycling there is no way i could work im trying for disability,0
work might be triggerring your depression/ anxiety at the moment meaning you might need to go on sick leave for awhile and work on yourself i dont think not working will benefit you in the long run i dont know what you do but thinking about another job if it is the job you are doing that is specifically causing issues i dont know where you are from im in uk and i work and get a certain amount of paid sick leave however the paid by my work but i was of over a year from july 2015 to august 2016 and received benefit as i was on half pay and then no pay for months but benefit a lot less than my pay its unlikely you would be put on permanent disability benefit which is sounds like your suggesting you would need to be seriously ill in hospital and unable to do anything for yourself or even talk to irger people to not be able to work i have bpd bp2 as well as anxiety and depression and i also have physical long term health conditions as there are times as ive mentioned when i am unable to work and on sick leave but when things improve i am able to return and my work is supportive you also need to be actively and on continuous treatment by a dr and medication who you can show and who will sat why you cannot work,1
i received approval for bipolar and anxiety i read the social security blue book chapter 12 and filled out my paperwork based on my documented medical problems,1
i have bp with mania dont know if thats one or two also other things ptsd fibromialga anxiety an i have disability,1
yes!! everyones case is differentmy anxiety bipolar 1came my my eplipsey surgery in 1998i had 2 apply in 2014and got it within 3months on my own with my doctors and familys supporti had 2 tryi do have 2 pay pillsand live,1
ive talked about this before it is all about your history and what you can show them you must have clear documentation i went with a very good and kind lawyer who reviewed my case and helped me every step of the way you must fill out your initial application on line and answer the questions in a specific way or you will be rejected automatically then you must have documentation from every doctor and hospital that has ever treated you as well as those therapists you have seen then you will also have to fill out a questionnaire about yourself that you must be very honest and open about it is brutal then a family member or spouse must also answer concerns mine was my sisters and nearly broke me to read it but it was the truth so basically you must have all your ducks in a row i am coming up on my 7 year review in 2019 i dont even know if i will still have benefits but i do know that i need to start getting prepared now and it scares the shit out of me! some of you think it would be better to "stick it out" and not be at home but my former employer did not understand my frequent need to be away from work and really they need you there and count on you as well as your fellow workers to be there it is not a commitment that i can give a company that i will be able to work full or even part time because i dont know when my symptoms will smack me down or when a manic or depressive cycle begins because mine come in rapid cycles it is terrifying for me when i dont recognize it happening to stop the process and what will happen if an employer sees this?? i had a horrible experience in my last job where my supervisor was afraid of me and refused to meet alone with me!?! all because of her misconceptions of bpd! so think long and hard before you begin the process of applying for ssdi it is not as easy as you think,0
this year the rules are changing so most people will no longer be awarded money for depression and anxiety you have to be very very bad now and be receiving a lot of treatment and say lost ur kids for not being able to care for them then u will be able to get it otherwise 90% are going to loose benefits best thing u can do it go get help like therapy trust me if u leave work u will feel worse off as their is nothing occupying ur mind its very isolating being at home speak to the wellbeing clinic they are wonderful its all a free service and they can do so much to help so u can feel back in control again its a hard road but u have to just keep going a step at a time i wish u all the best u dont need a dr btw to see wellbeing u can refute urself which is wonderful x,0
id avoid this i highly doubt you will be better off the government is also making it more difficult maybe consider fmla to get therapy and assistance with coping it is very hard to get ssi,1
bp1/panic disorder/ ptsd i got ssi my first try at the age of 28 i think my case maybe a little different because i was diagnosed at 17 with hospitals stays in between the time i got on ssi medical paperwork is very important for your case,1
i got disability and ssi for depression/anxiety but i had to hire a lawyer to win my case i was denied three times which im told is common in the process,0
my drs just told me 2 apply im bipolar 2 severe anxiety ocd and a ton of physical ailments 29 yrs young,1
yes im on disabilityit took a lot but luckily i had a melt down and major panic attack at centrelink so they saw me in meltdown,1
i have more patoentsthat work for direct tv century link and comcast i think those companies cause extreme anxiety,1
i have more patoentsthat work for direct tv century link and comcast i think those companies cause extreme anxiety,1
been waiting for ssdi hearing for a year for my bp2/anxiety - fed student loans were just discharged though - it takes time but you arent alone its tough - friend request if you want,0
im on ssdi because of my severe depression anxiety and suicidal ideations i too am 37 now but got disability 3 years ago if they can prove that you cant work due to your illnesses then you will be ok but know that it is a long process youll get denied several times off the bat i would recommend you find a good attorney who wont charge you unless you win they wont take your case if they dont think you will get it best of luck to you,1
yup for chronic general anxiety social anxiety depression adhd and another thing,0
i am bp2 anxiety few other things on on ssdi,1
substance abuse is often associated with mood disorders and i have found in my own life that addiction is a serious battle: i can become addicted to anything it seems not just the usual drugs however remember when you are fighting not to feel ashamed you are addicted you are not bad or weak or lousy and you should not be ashamed! you are amazing and remember that just because you relapsed doesnt mean you failed just keep trying to quite! thats what is important,1
i dont think it is a good thing to bring religion on this page as it is too contentious i cant say what i really think as it would upset people,0
i hate to say it but most teenagers are made to do a lot of housework its just a part of growing up you need to talk to your parents about seeing a dr self diagnosing is never a good idea mental health is a complex illness and there are many factors that go into a diagnosis do you have s school counsellor that you can speak to? i know you must feel pretty bad now but your lack of friends most likely wouldnt be because you are too ugly or too fat it might be how you feel but anxiety and illnesses like depression can make you believe things that arent true have your old friends said that? if they did then be grateful they arent in your life anymore i really strongly suggest you speak with your parent about seeing a doctor who can refer you to a psychiatrist for evaluation and a therapist to give you some tools to help you cope if you like to research try cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness these are 2 approaches used in the mental health space and can really help,0
ah i remember doing these exact things sadly except the working part and had to go between only two doctors and feeling somewhat of a relief after the sessions from what i can assume perhaps you should take your prescribed medication that your doctor has given you before work i am diagnosed as a bi polar psychotic and have real bad anxiety as well i take lorazepam and risperidal,1
i take latuda at night because it makes me sleepy and xanax throughout the day for anxiety,1
dealing with your worst fears and memories is draining maybe your therapist can spend the last 30 min of your sessions teaching you techniques to calm yourself down and change mental gears ❤,1
im always afraid of this,0
my oldest son has this along with ptsd it is a struggle for him everyday and i admire him for staying strong love you nicky,0
my daughter suffers bpd & is so hard to watch her struggle~sandi~,0
get back to a doctor and get on medication tell them how you feel on meds but taking medication to help keep your stability is nothing to be ashamed of it is reality and you are not alone hugs and prayers,1
i no exactly how u feel im 26 with 2 children i have managed without medication for my mental health for a good many years as a mum i didnt want to feel like zombie at the moment im struggling so much and its effecting my kids so now im having to look back at medication im about to start a new antisycotic which im hoping will help and not make me to sleepy its such a hard balance maybe u just need something for now like im doing till u can get urself back on track i see medication as a support but not a cure ill be on them till i feel i can manage again ur not failing by taking something we all need to do whats best for our families talk with ur partner be honest my husbands been my rock if u really dont want meds there are a lot of talking therapies and other treatment im doing 1 soon to help with emotional control so talk to ur gp see whats available excersise is really good it helps clear the mind never be afraid to ask for help its the bravest thing u can do i hope u find something that helps u wishing u all the best xx,0
i am the mother of two adult children emma peetz who has given you wise counsel in her reply is one until tecently the mental illness of my youngest daughter was so debilitating i was her carer for far too many years fortunately emmas bipolar isnt so severe she has ever needed a carer and works and support s herself and cares for her son who is now a teenager i am an advocate for carers and mental illness in sydney and recently addressed a conference on the subjects i will wuote you a couple of relevannt parts of what i had to say as it may help you "medication can usually quickly relieve physical suffering but relieving the suffering of mental illness can take years" during that time she was hospitalized many times and various medications were tried by caring and wonderful clinicians the current medications have worked and at 31 she can actually look forward to a fulfilling life and is now an advocate for the mentally ill i wrote her a poem which said in part "she sank to the depths of despair as her soul surrendered to the gods the demons and the shadow people that lived in the fires of her wounded mind" i can only encourage you to follow the advice of expert clinicians as i was able to finish the poem for my daughter with: "hercgentle spirit endured strong enough to come into her light once morewhe but still tremlinng with fear for she had seen the dark side of the mind " there was an australian poet who suffered from your illness who also wrote a poem which finishes: "and the world my girl is a good world after all"am sure you too can come to that place but it may take many wise minds and no doubt the right meds for you to get to that place,1
understand but still struggle worth this daily,0
do you know what yourself really is? because with bipolar on or off meds a simple reaction can leave you wondering whats me and whats my disease you do have a child to think of and stabilization of your mood swings while dealing with some side effects is potentially best for the whole family im not prescribing zombie doses - good mood stabilizers dont do that and they protect you from the highs and lows racing thought can be addressed with an atypical anti psychotic such as ziprasidone at bedtime and will help with these overwhelming feelings youre having too in your brain its all about chemical imbalances in the brain that need to be augmented good luck sweetie!,0
im bipolar & on setraline diazapam & quetiapine it took my mental health team 2 years to find the right medication for me as olanzapine & apiprizole was making me a zombie& paranoid ever since i started exercise & running at the gym i have felt so much better and my mind more clearer and no more voices & bad thoughts exercise is the best solution for a better mind,1
whats helping me is getting in some exercise i walk/jog 30+ minutes a day i also have pets which are my emotional support animals talk therapy helps me too i was in your place a few years ago i quit taking my meds and everything spun off course its not shameful to need meds my body has a chemical imbalance if i had diabetes id take my insulin please be open to trying all of the above if you try everything and its still not better you may have a chemical imbalance like i do please keep talking youre doing the important first step ,1
music! thats always been something that i love so when i am getting all up in my head thats where i turn ive had a hard time for 3 years now with ptsd depression among other things this evil little thing can get into our minds and make us think we can do anything all we can do is isolate (which i do too btw) think about why and what is wrong with us we all have people who love us i have 2 little boys who need their mom more now than ever i had to be put on something to keep my mind from racing that is always my problem ive set with ear buds in my ears and told myself " you know courtney tomorrow just do 1 more thing different for your good and so thats what i have been doing for a year everyday do 1 thing different or the way i think i should do it and havent been or do something right do something to better anything in my life and it has helped im not gonna say im 100% better because im not i still have horrible days but ill tell you this and i do not like hearing it either and it makes me very mad but if a med doesnt work go to your doc and get another one i did that a year ago and had a nervous breakdown and it has been the darkest hole ive had to pull myself out of its been the worst maybe find a new doc or go to a homeopathic doc they are great just be careful about your meds and know that you arent alone all my prayers and thoughts for you you r not alone,0
breath dont worry let it all go the safety of the child and your health is first when you fell it getting over welming breath through it just stop and breath a mountain is a mole hill through gods eyes,0
she specifically states that she is overwhelmed and losing it she doesnt need to see a psych but by her own words she is not managing it she even says her negative thoughts are consuming her this is a person who needs help,0
you are not alone!! i too struggle with bipolar disorder and other things please seek a mental health professional asap there is no shame in getting the help that you need i send my love and prayers to you! there is light at the end of the tunnel and its not an incoming train,0
if you can replace that job with a similar type of job with hours there are more suitable to your needs at please do it that job will kill you and all the stress is not helping your sensitive issue,1
michael mueller growing up in a home with parents who both have no mental health education or formal diagnosis i can tell you the symptom that hurts children is pushing them away or causing them to feel as if you dont want them i doubt they even really notice or care that you procrastinate,0
yes and the weepingand hypochondria john carli and jessica? do you suffer from hypochondria? and always tired its so sad really and i want to be alone and then i get depressed and anxious because i am alonesuch a mess,0
i hear you! the stress of putting things off youd think it would motivate us to get things done answer go to bed,0
thats actually the total opposite of me because of my mental illness and seeing society judge othera so harshly my hygiene is like the one aspect i can control so i always brush my teeth and shower and such daily its almost to the extreme opposite although i am dealing with the same issues so i am extremely understanding of those who just cant muster the energy its just the one thing i never struggle with,0
i feel the same and its hard! the only thing that keeps me going is my kids i have to do things for them and its a daily struggle i hate it i feel like i dont enjoy anything and its sad,0
this is me alot of the time however i got the courage to see a counsellor and it has helped me not only talking through issues and thoughts you have but she has shown me techniques for coping with my anxiety and depression! i have seen some improvement,1
i dont know if it will help but i can promise you that even if you cant feel it or him there is a god and he knows who you are and loves you for exactly who you are i would also recommend finding a good therapist and a psychiatrist but i also want you to know you are loved and valuable i dont know you personally but i know you are a precious son of god that christ has experienced all the pains and fears that you have felt i have a difficult time accepting christs love for me but its easy for me to know and bear witness of his love for others never never never give up!!!,0
difficulty sleeping makes dealing with life overwhelming connect with a dr who can refer you to a psychiatrist and should send you for therapy i believe medication is only part of the solution in the mean time do some research for cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness mindfulness is great for anxiety and wonderful for racing thoughts when trying to get to sleep there are a lot of resources in the net but of course a face to face consultation is always better,1
this is the last page i wanted to see this meme attached too omg the admin needs a smack since harly quin was added to the dc universe she has been shown to be abused manipulated beaten threatened and at one point in the animated series smashed out of a window 4 stories up to the point she had to be wheeled into arkham in a wheelchair all by her "puddin" joker she have intense stockholm syndrome,0
tried that failed miserably,1
i do the exact same thing i have less than half an hour to get dressed and here i sit ill not shower because ill have some irrational fear of the world ending while i am naked i have my so write a list for me and it helps hold me accountable if i think i am doing it for someone else,0
you are among friends! i too struggle to take a shower and am bipolar 2 and some other crap thrown in today i took my shower before noon and went with my husband to target without having a panic attack! victory is mine!!,1
just to let you know that you can message me anytimeyour not alone on this pageand im so sorry to hear about you cancer but so glad your getting betterim bipolar also and have just over the last 9 months been diagnosedand yeah your right everything screams and nobody just doesnt seem to notice at time and i live in a family of 5 my partner and 3 childrenand its not nice for me when they just tell me to shut up and take my medicationits one of the worse things they can say cos at that moment my mind then starts telling me well they must be against me and it can spiral out of controlits a terrifying thing so i can imagine your pain when you dont have anyone to turn tooall i can say is please try and be strong and keep going and remember through every dark night there is a brighter dayalso just pm i really dont mindkeep your head up xxxx,0
i think i know how you feel you dont want to worry your mom but you need some support thats what these pages are for there are lots of fellow sufferers out there that can relate to your situation i know you like to rely on your mom but from what youve said she seems to have enough worries of her own at the moment do you have any self help techniques that you can practice? do you meditate? also wondering if you have a good therapist ive been struggling badly myself but im doing ok lately i hope you can find a way through your difficulties,0
i have read this 11 times and and i (i am very sorry if i offend you in any way )see you have just typed everything about me i am looking at my life in this text as if i was a mirror i am feeling a bit overwhelmed again i am sorry if i offend you i find this hard to explain to anyone it comes out of my mouth the wrong way and then i feel stupid and go lock myself away or i explode and shout and scream for the silliest reason the only thing is i havent hurt my self but if i do have pain i let it get really bad as i feel comfort in it i but at times i feel i am just waiting to die i am only 52 i dont know where to turn or what to do i am so confused i hope you can find the help you need and may your god bless you and your family with love health wealth and happiness,0
meds are an important part of your well being but one of threethe other two are 1: therapy and 2: a positive influencer in your life both are a challenge to find good docs for the meds and good therapists for your behaviors/thinking are too few and many times overwhelmed yet they are essential as for the influencerthink of them as a cheerleader or a mentor someone whom both encourages and assists you with good things in your life daily if possible look me up on fb if you think i could be of help,0
dont stop your meds unfortunately they are not a cure they will help you feel better for a while and then your mood can shift you may need a med change but therapy like dbt (dialectical behaviour therapy) may be really useful learning to manage your mood changes can be really helpful and make them less frightening talk to your doctor i hope all goes well,1
i dont know what med or meds youre on i hope a good mood stabilizer like lithium at a dose like 900mg talk to your doctor about anti psychotics at night to rest your brain and give you regular sleep and both these types of drugs help with anxiety,1
a little break in life for me was 4 years of isolation very bad i am bipolar withe anxiety and ptsd and on top of that im an alcoholic in recovery,1
sure as most everyone has said find what works for you i watch tv obviously spend time checking fb out and take naps as needed some of the naps are from physical exertion but some are from the overwhelming emotional exertion that comes over me ,1
even if u need to take 2 days off work- mental illness is as serious as physical illness if youre feeling unwell thats a sick day too and u dont need to be specific about why u call in sick if u dont rest and your anxiety spirals way out of control u may end up hospitalized and or missing a lot more work,1
taking a break is important also when you feel up to it research mindfulness it has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety it takes practice but it is well worth it,1
nothing wrong with that at all if it feels right for you at the time go for it ive done it myself before admittedly not in bed but ive crashed out on the settee for a day i echo what bryan said be careful about making sure it doesnt take over your life i think it could end up feeding the anxiety if it becomes a regular thing but for an odd occasion nothing wrong with it in my opinion hope this helps u,0
simonchini was found guilty of manslaughter back in 2006 and jailed he killed 9 of his patients by injecting baking soda into them worth a try? no thanks!,1
