sorry you have been treated like that in my experience ive had to be very firm with drs in order to have them listen to me i know my blood pressure increases when i have high anxiety and i still take blood pressure meds and its normal now when my anxiety is under control take a mood journal outlining your moods and anxiety for at least a fortnight and take it to your dr do you have an at home blood pressure machine? i take my bp twice a day or more often if im not feeling right like during extreme anxiety and take that too if you dont have one i know some pharmacies here in australia will take bp for free if none of that works its time to change dr,1

emdr is incredible!!! i cannot praise it enough! i was offered it for ptsd several years ago and ill admit i was skeptical however it worked and things that i couldnt ever stand thinking about i can now talk about without feeling upset all over again the science behind how it works is fascinating! good luck! xx,0
of course it was scripted it is a work of fiction! the way it was shot was original at that time and seeing in the theater was a great experience because it amped up the tension as it went along and you could really feel what the characters were feeling the actors were given a basic script dropped off in a forest and left to improvise a lot and capture their real reactions because they didnt really know what to expect and i thought that really helped the overall feel of the movie i know some people dont care for it but i just loved it! ☺,0
im sorry i dont have a solution for you but you arent sponging and you shouldve feel ashamed to ask for assistance or help you need it in order to get better im in the same situation and its so hard some days i wish there was more help for those with mental illness worrying about having a roof over your head or stress doesnt help when you are ill dont lose hope when things get bad i hope things get better,0

my boyfriend and i both have anxiety and depression and i think the biggest key for us has been communication its hard for me to express my thoughts and feelings because i get wrapped up in my head and i cant always rationally think through situations when i get panicky he stays calm and gently encourages me to talk to him about whatever is going on ask her though its wonderful you are doing your research but she knows herself best and if you want to please her shed be the one to find out how from good luck to you both i hope your relationship flourishes,0
you have heard correctly it doesnt have to be that you get irritated and stay that way it can be a number of things for everyone it is different i went from bpii to bpi,0
me too its a struggle every day to just get by,0
hang onit really does help to write out your frustrations talking them out with a therapist or trusted friend also helps im a christian but sometimes i worry fret & over think to the point that im unable to think straight then suddenly i realize that i havent actually stopped & asked god to help me at times thats really all im able to do is ask him to help me he hasnt failed me yetas long as i give him my burdens & then trust him with whatever his will ishe loves to hear me ask he loves it when i put my faith & trust in him,0
my anxiety would make me cry for no reason at all even if i had a reason it made it worse and uncontollable and id end up in a major panick attack might not be on the right meds or need an additional med to what you are already taking had to increase my prozac to 60 mg and ativan 1mg 1/2-1 tab as needed,1
i knew from your first few lines that it would be down to being told you werent good enough when you were younger (been there myself) im glad you found your voice today and spoke to us about how you feel that will empower you and make you feel stronger i found my voice in my late teens and moved away from the toxic people in my life - please find a good counsellor to talk through your self esteem and anxiety issues as they can help you - good luck xx,0
i have a 7 day pill organizer that i fill every monday morning helps me remember when i need to refill i also have alarms on my phone as well as back ups to remind me to take my meds the 7 day pill organizer has individual days that i can take with me if i am going to be away from home so i dont miss a dose too,1
i have bpd and have been on venlfaxine /effexor for about 10yrs initially they helped with my depression but im not so sure now ive been wanting to come off them for a while but my dr advises the decrease will take at least 12mths to avoid withdrawal symptoms unfortunately what works for one person doesnt necessarily work for another so even if i were to say venlfaxine was great for my anxiety they may not have the effect on you blessings ,1
thank you susan i have to be back on monday and already stressing,0
go to the doctor pregnancy changes your hormones so much and theyll go up and down really bad especially after birth you can choose not to change your meds but your doctor needs to be aware of this and a change of meds can be a temp thing til your hormones settle some from the pregnancy also post partum depression is a very real threat especially to those of us with a history of mental illness please dont try to just tough it out go get help you want to be your best for your child? then you need to take care of yourself first its like the same concept when your on a plane you put your oxygen mask on first then your childs you cant care for a tiny human if you dont care for yourself trust me im 4 weeks post partum diagnosed post partum depression theres a lot of times taking care of my baby is really hard like really hard but its easier to handle by taking care of myself,1
this is such a huge mess if it werent for the fact that i need health insurance and a new car (i totaled mine) i would be looking elsewhere but im desperate and its within walking distance,0
i was diagnosed at 13 here i am at 21 and still struggle most days i live for the good times though i barely see anyone anymore but i take my down time to enjoy myself i take walks listen to music go volunteer or sometimes just go get something sweet its a fight everyday but the good days are the ones you look forward to,0
i looked at your meds but i dont see you on mood stabilizers! you are yo-yoing! i avoid depression and mania via lithium and zonisamide and i take an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone to shut my mind down from thinking at night and keeping me awake anti depressants can make depression way worse and induce mania mood stabilizers dont do that i would seriously overhaul your regime,1
i have fibromyalgia and it can add to the depression and anxiety my whole body feels like flu aches and intensifies with stress,1
hi nemo i struggle with my weight through medication also i know you say that diet and exercise dont seem to work but they should just slowly the best advice i can offer is to increase protein fruit (grapefruit is a natural fat burner)  vegetables (iron rich leafy greens) swap simple carbohydrates for complex ones saturated (trans fats) for unsaturated fats (rapeseed oil has the lowest content of saturated fat and also helps reduce cholesterol) green teas acai berry supplement raspberry key tones supplements probiotics to aid your digestive system switch to dark chocolate (but dont eat it before bed or your body will store it as fat a small eaten in the morning has proven benefits) and most importantly drink as much water throughout the day as you can (i fill a jug and put sliced limes lemons and ginger root in then stick it in the fridge its really tasty and good for you) hope this helps! ~vw~,1
i feel for you its not an easy road have you been given meds?? ive found out i had bipolar 10 years ago i have been on a multitude of meds till the right combination was found therapy also helped a lot i have actually been very stable but cant handle stress very well,1
look up mindfulness on the internet you can even get apps for your phone it helps you focus on the here and now and the anxiety drifts away it has been a godsend,1
i talked to my gp about my dark thoughts and she could not handle them freaked put and demanded to have me admitted a psychiatrist had to educate her on what thoughts are and how to determine the real risk embarrassing for her i dont see her any more,0
you just wrote what so many people have gone through my son age 34 has been struggling all his life it is heart breaking to see him struggle every day of his life he is my hero but i hate the ignorance of so many people that just dont get it and shame him or his dad and i he knows his disease well and is a good advocate for himself even though i go with him to all doctor appts he has learned on his own some wonderful coping skills that help us all out when he is angry for no apparent reason he will hold his hand up like stop we then know not to disturb him or talk to him until he comes back to us and starts talking i am so very proud of him and all the people that fight the battle every day god speed,0
i set alarms on my phone,0
and! just to top it off ive lost all confidence in my gp who doesnt think im bipolar how can i express how i feel when i have to judge peoples response before i even open my mouth? well!! guess what?! i havent been able to " pull myself together " or "give my head a wobble" for over twenty years my world gets smaller n smaller every day but i go on fight struggling along with something no-one sees,0
i have bi polaranxiety and depression really bad its terrible to deal with on a daily basis!,1
if i try to go without it  i need to do it three times as much and trying to restrain myself drives me nuts and i think about it all time church didnt help it just made me feel guilty 24 /7 thank god i just masterbate alot to cope with it to keep the cravings down  i love masterbating  i think everyone does,0
anyone who takes their own life must be in a horrible state unless you have been there you cant possibly imagine the pain these people are going through i do believe in the future there will medication and a lot more help and people will say "oh god you just let these people suffer" in the meantime we just got to hang on in there as hard as it is this site is really good at least you dont feel so alone,0
i diffuse essential oils to help me sleep and deal with my anxiety and depressive phases along with my medsi havent had to increase any meds for 3 yrs now,1
yeah i kinda left out alot of my story as i felt it was to long i suffer from anxiety (time issues) and ocd i have become more awkward in social settings as i didnt use to be my story is long and some of it very concerning and intense (things i did as a child up until my teenage years) ive wondered if i have bipolar l,1
anyone thats gona patronise someone with struggles should keep their stuff to themselveswe all have different struggles united we should stand!!!,0
we should i feel very alone in this process of trying to get better most of the time i cant seem to find many that understand and cant shake the stigma associated with depression mostly,0
i have an alarm on my phone set daily to tell even to take my mess at 930 every day,0
i go through it when i am overwhelmed,0
i dont take lamictal but experience those symptoms way too often mine is a case of hypnogogic hallucinations hypnopompic hallucinations & sleep paralysis its very scary to experience but is a result of how my body falls asleep and wakes and is not related to any psychosis this may be what is happening with you too glad you got ahold of the other doctor though i hope the seraquel helps,1
everybody is diffrent on their path through bipolar you get stronger as you grow and i realised its not my fault which is a much better place to be once you get there after all the doubt and self blame my focus now is art therapy which is so amazing and less intrusive than 1 to 1 talking the ability to express how you feel instead of running over all the negatives about yourself setting yourself goals in really small pieces even if its tyding one shelf at a time a journal is good my challenges are to stay on meds and keep healthy the meds will probably change as you get older as they find ones that work better for you the depression is talking when you feel everyone would be better off without you this does get easier just remember you are worth being looked after and deserve a good start in life worrying about you is natural for your parents to do it would happen even if you didnt have bipolar take care xxx,1
you continue to struggle daily with bipolar illness and this really describes your life keep on with your therapist and your commitment for dbt you can live despite this illness until thru research there are better answers,0
never be embarrassed these struggles we have arent our choice we do the best we can those of us that have family and friends to support us are lucky for their love id be lost without mine dont give up <3,0
for some reason the cold helps with my anxiety? thats all i know anyone feel this way as well ?,1

i like to sleep a lot when i go to bed its like ive turned off all the worry and stress,1
cannibals terror pathetic,0
the comments im seeing on here are horrific im going to report some of these people to the admins they already removed someone yesterday you are scared because you are young and this is the life you are used to but you are doing the right thing for yourself you have to make yourself #1 in this situation-- called self-preservation i had to do it too but i was much older than you are yes it is scary but you are so smart and doing all the right things-- and youre lucky you have so many people in your corner dont stay there-- it is not a healthy environment for you keep moving forward and hang in there!,0
when it comes down to it no one likes medication i have decided to go off antidepressants and have reduced my dose by half in the last couple of months goal is not to be on them at all too many side effects including loss of libido and osteoporosis i know that antidepressants are a quick fix but after crying for a week and feeling a sense of helplessness i got my sorry arse into gear and started exercising and noted an improvement immediately following my first session im looking forward to getting off the antidepressants for good i have bipolar and i would rather be blue than taking too many medicines as well as not having to pay for another script as my shrink has told me if you remove the stressors from your life that is causing your anxiety and depression consider not adding them to your regime less meds the better i believe i also do mental health nursing and have come to realise that the cocktail of medicines that people are on is nothing less than outrageous and these people are not feeling better at all exercise force yourself its worth it and i am sure you will agree that it lifts your mood even after one session good luck,1
i the only reason i post this kind of stuff is so that people will understand depression betterwhen people hear the word mental illnessthey shy away from youafraid they may catch itit is not contagiousi wont hurt youi wont start talking crazy thingsim just methe same as you,0

according to my husband depression and anxiety are things people allow themselves to have and they should just not allow themselves to get that way it is just a cop out to get out of things,0
in simple terms bipolar i is the more severe of the 2 you experience extreme highs where things are completely irrational and severe lows where things couldnt get much worse bipolar 2 is not so severe but just as real and hard to deal with,0
mania usually associated with bipolar 1 and person has lack of insight into their behaviour during episode which can have devastating impact on daily life and include lowering of inhibitions sexual behaviour impulsivity high energy but inappropriate belief they are invincible paranoia fixation etc while hypomania associated with bipolar 2 and person does not lose insight or display psychotic thoughts but high energy extreme irritability fixated and obssessed with doing something/someone something someone said  not as extreme as mania but bipolar 2 cycling between depression/ hypomania is often more frequent and hypomamia can last few weeks then occur every few weeks so very unstable,0
havent been diagnosed bipolar yet but they are looking at it i am like both of you and struggle to control it i dont have any sexually driven partners so its just a lot of self care and sexual frustration,0

sounds like you need to visit the doctor you seem a bit confused you could be bipolar but youre not actually very clear about what youre saying go and see the doctor and have a talk,0
this is what i started to do before my manic depressive episode i am not trying to diagnose you but if you have a regular psychiatrist please talk to them i had chronic depression for five years and as the stress built up while preparing to teach a class of my peers i finally had to be "committed" for two weeks for my own safety your upcoming trial is definitely more of an ordeal then mine i wish you well and pray you receive the help and justice required,1

an take some rispiridone and it knocks that "everyone is watching me edge" off im schizo affective adhd bipolar ive had 3 serious nervous break downs i take adderal no its probably not the best idea ( elvis) but as doctor says and i agree " it helps my patient focus and finish projects or chores it helps him live a somewhat normal life with out this medicine my life becomes a mess the house turns into a maze of unfinished cleaning and projects my brain thinks to fast and i sometimes struggle to keep up with myself the adderal lifts me up a bit yes not that much it then helps me to slow down and think things out to properly finish everything i start and i dont fidget and squirm ur right probably not the best combo for everyone but i simply take rispiridone to knock off that nasty edge,0

im bipolar type 2 with ptsd and anxiety i also am seasonally affected its common i take a small dose of antidepressant from oct-feb annually because the depression is so bad in those seasons and some years i need a small additional mood stabilizer or antipsychotic in spring or summer for the hypomania sleeplessness racing thoughts anger overspending being a total busy beebut the med changes keep the more severe reactions like suicidal thoughts at bay im sorry about your partner thats truly not healthy and not good for your well being you need love and support,1

i dont have an opinion about ok or not ok i do have this thought- are you ready to give up what you will be missing? is it so bad that nothing is worth living for because of what you have to live through? the pain the numbness the sadness self-doubt and lack of motivation can be the most difficult things in the world to deal with i understand completely ive been there ive been there with the blade against my wrist i thought for a moment that nothing was left that could balance this weight i was wrong about that and realizing it was what saved me i want you to do something before you consider whether or not its ok i want you to find something anything it doesnt have to be any particular thing find that thing and really experience it whatever it is really take the time to live it to get cliche a sunrise a hug a puppy are all good examples but it can be literally anything that you think of live it and and repeat a few times with other things once youve done that think about whether or not youre ready to give it all up everything every experience every potential joy no matter how fleeting everyone everywhere are you ready to give it all up to quieten your brain? remember that no person is ever so much of a burden that they need to take themselves out of the equation and that everything you experience is valid and vital to you nothing about you is worthless because you are a mind and feelings and thoughts and ideas and an identity that will never exist again and has never existed before you are invaluable and of incalculable worth think about all of this before you decide anything please you are precious and it would be a shame to lose you,0
my son is 16 and hasnt gone to school in a month he is also struggling with depression and anxiety it took me a couple of years to get him to agree to go to counseling i made him an appointment with a psychiatrist and a therapist he went to his first counseling session on wednesday and he said he thinks it is going to help him and he really likes his therapist i think when they finally understand that therapy isnt a bad thing that is when the good happens just continue to be supportive and dont nag i hope he comes around and decides to do therapy it honestly helps more than anything good luck,0
its where you put an elastic band (like a rubber band or hair tie) on your wrist and when you start to feel anxious/nervous (or any other bad habit/emotion) you snap the band against your wrist it didnt work for me because i have an extremely high pain tolerance,1

started on 50mg was increased to 100mg & then to 150mg i find it dries me up something fierce but that may be the mix of my other meds (carbemazepine leviteracitam & diazepam) as well id been told that higher doses of sertraline could work for anxiety as well as depression but right now im only indicated for depression,1
you need to see your doctor i get like that when i have too much lithium in my blood which can be dangerous or just by taking some antipsychotics the head shaking also combined with an uncontrollable jaw ive found a balance of lithium and my antipsychotic olanzapine so i dont get it much any more its something that you shouldnt have to put up with im not saying thats what you have just my experience i hope it helps,1

mentally ill people are stronger than normal people can ever be always remember that sometimes other peoples issues can make you feel that you are wrong but she how you really feel when someone is finally willing to tell you the naked truth i find it just plain cruel for the next person to lie to you while the truth sets us free we can handle the truth better than not knowing not knowing desturbs us and for what its worth i think we are who and what we are because we have the truth inside ourselves as life is supposed to by lived by yet the normal peoples in acceptance of life is far fetched from the truth that we came into being with so dont feel sorry for being honest true consistent caring loving supportive and brave enough to live and love as "mentally ill people" no one deserves us unless they know how to love as we do the right way the only way the real way we are real people the minute everyone accepts that we can all feel free within and do what the likes of bill gates einstein richard brandon and so many others hthat has contributed massively to the advancement of this world can do so accept your delve as an already evolved being and that you are more valuable to this life than many people fear you because they know you can do so much better own it own what you gave these qualities you have that so many aspire to become the irony is that they seek us out to experience only yge laughter and joy that rubbs off on them in our company no more unnessasary apologies for things another persons weakness makes you speak the truth of i love you and you are all magnificent please forgive any spelling errors i was inspired and have overcome and couldnt turn back to edit love you unconditionally,0
not many drs prescribe lithium anymore as there are "better newer " ones my boyfriends on lithium and the change has been amazing! we naturally have lithium in our brains but a lot of depression anxiety etc comes from our lithium levels being outta whack should definitely see a dr and ask to get his levels checked and hopefully start him on it!,1
vemladaxine is antidepressant and not aware it has particularly beneficial sedative side effects venlafaxine is one of the drugs i took for many years for depression / anxiety and like any of these drugs you can feel worse initially because it is helping your brain function warning though do not miss a dosage withdrawal symptoms are horrendous and i mean horrendous,1

mindfulness will change your life focusing back to the present moment does wonders mindfulness is a hard skill to learn so try not to get upset at yourself if you lose focus keep practicing and have it become a part of your lifestyle,0
the gods have a plan the plan is for us to live in such a way that we exemplify something noteworthy even if its just being strong and brave enough to do what scares the bleedin hell out of you also not being a dick because someone posts something you may not agree with because all opinions and views exist here and not every neutral post speaks to everyones specific life so you can let this go and let the ones who need to see this get some help too,0

im looking at getting all medication regularly myself after going back and forth on it how many years straight have you been taking it christopher and have you had any major side effects that were a problem? that is one thing that i worry about,0
i am undiagnosed but doubtless bipolar the only thing that ever helped more than medication and counseling was cleaning my diet and daily exercise until it hurts started off with 20 minutes around the block every day and became a habit i ordered some kettle bells to work at home and that hurts too it gives me a high and the pain isnt nearly what i suffered with severe active diagnosis i wake up with a head of old recordings and they burn off like the morning fog now i can see a future and medication was cut in half in 30 days it was the solution for me it was the only thing i had not tried a better life awaits me outside of my head i wish you well,1
that is the only reason i have not killed myself because of guilt i feel as if it would be too selfish,0
yes im bp2 with adhd depression anxiety i was on zoloft for a long time and i didnt seem to have any major problems the worst side effect was that it took away my sex drive,1
there are lots of things that you can control in your life to help you not get that sped up high like getting the same amount of sleep every night like not drinking too much coffee ( sometimes one cup is too much!) and having a list of things to do to slow yourself down if i sense myself starting to mouth off i go in my room and i get more rest ( stops the acceleration i pray but everyone is different and antidepressants cause mood swings into mania if we are prone to it i am beginning to think that there are a lot of people who might be better off not on long term antidepressants like they get left on thembecause of all the side effects taking another medication that has more serious side effects to cover the first medications side effects is not real smart i am sixty two and now find out i have damage to my liver and kidneys i also took naproxen and lots of tylenol the past eighteen years i did not realize the cost also there is weight gain and that is depressing which makes a vicious cycle take as little as you can of these meds and do all you can to be healthy on a regular schedule not overworked and discipline yourself before you get stupid -i found out that when i was tired stressed overworked feeling alone and desperate in trying to solve problems that was when i was in danger of doing something stupid live your life with care sports and physical exercise that is safe and not excessive can really help some people can take less medication because they exercise on a regular basis some people get manic and abuse drugs or alcohol because they like the feeling and want to stay feeling on top of the world but dont be tempted any overdoing it in any area is dangerous be extremely cautious in relationships ( especially getting into them) a good person is not in a rush to get into a relationship if you are your normal self you will be careful and be safe! write out a plan for staying safe and balanced and not going off the deep end when you start to get sped up notice the first signs of getting sped up for me it is not sleeping have a few people to confide in what is really going on keep a diary keep a mood chart spending can be dangerous careful in all the areas that you might get carried away in depression you might not be good enough to yourself or seek a pick me up of spirits that will not last i read the bible and i pray i like to read psalms in the bible it was written in a different time ( war time) and by a king who had many enemies so there are references to thatbut it is awesome in prayers and praise to god depression and illness are our enemies psalms helps me trust in god and get my feelings out to god then the gospels remind me of who jesus is and what he has done and will do for me if i have faith and ask! dont be alone and dont let pills be the only answer some moods are normal our enemies are the ones that take control and are hard to get loose from be wise and ask god for wisdom proverbs in the bible says that there is success in having many advisors counselors help you check in with how you are doing if you dont like one get another one but give one a chance a few sessions at least ( unless you can tell right away they are not for you) ,1
i honestly think its going to be a struggle to find one that doesnt have at least one of those side affects listed each person is different so will process medications differently speak to your doctor for advice but go with the one thats side affects are most manageable for you most importantly the ones that work for your condition ~vw~,1
keep in mind that im typing this without any kind of attitude im not upset or hostile im just talking but that dude is 100% your biggest problem he does absolutely nothing sits on his ass all day long playing video games up until very recently he sat on his ass all day long playing video games and smoking thetic which he will do again mark my words you should not have to clean up after his lazy ass but you do it anyway because you allow him to sit around doing nothing all day in a nutshell youre an enabler im not saying you dont fight him about it but youve never followed through on a single threat youve made where hes concerned why would he wanna change? why would he ever wanna try to be anything more than he is right now? because hes got a meal ticket (you) snuggly tucked away in his back pocket he knows that if he pisses you off all he has to do is spit some sugarcoated bullshit in your ear and youll fall back in his lap he is a grown man amanda and hes no different than your 6 (7?) year old son do you even realize how much better off youd be if his worthless ass just left? how much extra money youd have? what do you even see in him? seriously cuz i could never be attracted let alone be in a relationship with someone like that i honestly believe that if he had his way hed lock himself in somebodys basement and do nothing but eat and play video games for the rest of his life ive never seen a human being who lacked ambition the way he does hes literally a potato i mean the man wears your clothes because hes too lazy to wash his own shirt seriously?! you deserve better!!!!! you shouldnt have raise a grown man and he is not going to change what the hell makes you wanna stay with him? i mean he does nothing he flat out refuses to get a job he steals your freaking bill money for gods sake he doesnt care how he looks he doesnt even have the decency to clean yalls home when youre at work a home he wouldnt even have if it werent for you thats not love amanda hes using you and idk why you cant see that or maybe youre just in denial but either way hes a fucking disgrace and you deserve so so so much better,0
i have depression and anxiety not fun,1
celexa worked well for both my daughters depression and mood disorders didnt help me at all buspar seems to be helping i only have been diagnosed with anxiety though,1
i took wellbutrin but after about two years it began making me extremely anxious but it was great at the beginning and i dont think thats a typical reaction ive been on neurontin (gabapentin) for several years its been really great for stabilizing overall but i really need to find a good antidepressant again one that will help with anxiety i also have add but my last psychiatrist said i shouldnt be talking stimulants so im kind of a mess hopefully i can get some changes made,1
ive been inpatient i will tell you this speak to your doctor first they will want to know where you are mentally there is no shame going inpatient you have to take care of yourself to be able to take care of your family my medication was what caused my issue a change to my medication and i was getting better its still been a long ride to finding a proper mix of medicine if you are not feeling ok and are a danger to yourself or others dont hesitate to call your doctor or go to the er,1
there are some meds that are considered safe while breastfeeding that i tried first (i waited until she was 9 months because i was so worried about it doing more harm than good but i couldnt handle the depression anymore) they took the edge off but werent super effective so once i stopped breastfeeding we went back to meds that had worked in the past it all works out in the end ,1
im on lamictal propanolol and citalopram its a good combo for me propanolol takes away the physical symptoms of anxiety but not the thoughts,1
i dont have answer because i do the exact same thing and then you just feel worthless and horrible i understand and struggle hope you start to feel better,0
ive had the anxiety and depression since i was 12 but they couldnt give me any medication because i was under 16,1
you just literally posted this on a page devoted to illnesses that sometimes take away from (or at least inhibit) the sufferers ability to choose this can we get some things on this page that are actually helpful and informative?,1
what would it look like with bipolardepression general anxiety and social anxiety? very interesting,1
just ask your gp they do understand its not good to stop all at once because of side affects dont be afraid to ask the question but be prepared for the response sometimes we feel we can do without medication ive tried numerous times only to end up back on them,0
this is very true i also keep a lot of shit to myself because the ones that actually do give a fuck are far too precious to me to risk alienating them with my shit i live them so much i think they deserve better than my shit so we concentrate on something else and their awesomeness makes me forget about my shit,0
my wife was on it and it made her brain shake and the brain zaps were horrible and then getting off cymbalta she had discontinuation syndrome,0
anxiety meditation d counselling/ therapy and hypnotherapy is susceptible to it medication if that helps but no substitute for good psychiatric - not gp - assessment cbt from a counsellor/therapist might help too,1
i was put on it in my hospital has to stop not helping with my anxiety it made my speach bad and very blurred vision  now im in bluspalits worked very good,1
usa for you 1 off the most ill countries on earth and take more drugs than anyone else my friend was on strong depression tablets and he was so sad and down all the time i told him he will always be the same untill he quits them he was unsure at 1st he went down little by little ending on a quarter of a tablet now on nothing they have there social life back go out and is happy again,0
all of this is sad but truei live it everyday!! my son dont get why i cant get up out of my room and go shopping or anything else for that matterwhen i come to my room life just stops for melike i cant cant get outhelp!!! how do u just get up and gomy life all changed in 2000 and again last yrso much death in my lifemy biggest fear is the fear of death!! the worst!!,0
talk your psychiatrist there are medicines that are ok mine kept me on my serequel cuz the benefits outweigh the risks they just kept an eye on everything if you want another baby you go girl,0
can i just say that alcohol is the worst thing for anxiety and depression youre not self medicating youre destroying yourself further not only should alcohol not be consumed with the drugs youre on but its also a depressant and can raise anxiety levels especially in the hangover period this is probably why you dont think your meds are working,1
i remember been like that with my ex husband but not with this bf that i have i dont know why but he is nice and a good person my ex husband was more handsome that my actual bf i dont know if i trust hem more cause i am more mature or because i am now in meds and i wasnt before i remember having my first mental breakdown when my cousing told me my husband was"cheating"on me since then i been havimg problems and it doent matter if i am ok i still have my time when i get sick and endup and a mental facilityi dont know exacly what works cause i been in the darkes situations and now i feel ok but i noticed i stoped 2 meds and i get upset easier than before i dont care if my bf stays late drinking with our neighbor i trust hem and i go to sleep happy without worries,1
i find it very stressful because my behavior during these times does not match who i really am i have tried conventional meds and am very resistant to them therefore i am no longer on anything i have lost people due to my behavior and i dont blame them doesnt mean they are better than me i take it as one can only take what i dish out for so long i have found and this is not for others to do without their doctors guidance is that i am better controlled without prescribed meds it does have its downfalls as in i am more isolated but i also dont make an ass of myself is this balance? probably not but it keeps me from taking people on my mental rollercoaster at least for now,1
thank you for your comments im sorry your anxiety didnt give you a break hopefully to get to enjoy your time even if its for a short time at a stretch take care,0
i want to but im afraid theyd turn me away claiming im not in a volatile state to do so,0
this whole conversation is disturbing,0
i am astonished by this conversation i have no children by birth but 3 grown adults for whom i have been a special "mom" i am acknowledged weekly with love and appreciation for the contributions and nurturing ive given through the past 10+ years i do not selfishly look for this it comes as a result of building and sustaining a strong relationship i have no "anxiety" over the issue whatsoever and personally feel you have blown this way out of perspective and are creating your own malcontent experience,0
hi im 22 i have some similar history when i was in college my anxiety was super high and i would miss school due to it i even failed a class because of it and i had no motivation first thing is to just breathe idk if you are on medications or anything but talking to someone and/or going to a psychiatrist for something is nothing to be ashamed of i couldnt function without medications literally i used to work at the childcare center at my local community college if you find little pleasure in your work thats okay for now you always need goals short term and long term it might be hard to find a passion at first i dont know who you are but i have a suggestion try something in the medical field i am in ems i could not live without it i love it whatever you settle for youve got this!,0
i take trintellix for depression works good took time but i like it and ativan for anxiety and other bipolar meds but those two are really good,1
me too i have a problem with irritability when im manic not fun at all,0
i openly talk with people about my bipolar disorder i tell them what i take how my mood varies how i know if i need my meds adjusted i am not ashamed of people knowing because its not who i am it just a part of who i am,1
you know whats been helping me? a fidget cube it fits in my hand and ive been actually falling asleep with it because thats when my anxiety is the worst idk about the band thing ive never heard of it but im just letting you know the cube helps me especially if you are concerned about self harm,0
i think she is worried about the bpd as it is developed through truamtic childhood speak with your child there is no too young,0
i have bipolar depression- anxiety schizophrenic and ptsd so i am struggling beyond measure to not be an emotional wreck,1
my ptsd major depressive disorder severe social anxiety and the catastrophic fallout on my total mental and physical health all make me avoid most social sittuations now i have my doctors other supporters a daughter a mom who also suffers and a few solid stable friends but  support like this online is also one of my daily life-supporting measures at this most frightening time,1
just dont let them talk you into taking a benzo such as xanax or klonopin ive been on klonopin for ten years and the withdraw is horrible plus it should only be short term use and now my memory isnt so great thanks to being on it a long time no one told me the effects of long term use,0
very true we have a daughter with bipolar 2 and addiction 15 yrs of crisis moments relapse and rehabs loads of worry and post traumatic stress type phone calls grieving the child we thought we new the lovely young talented woman who we had such great hopes forthe greatest sadness of my life i am thankful for ala-non support,0
put yourself in the middle of good people and let them show you they care if no-one does then stop worrying and start learning you accept you and try to be happier,0
ive been fighting for 2 years and im now in the appeals process because a judge said im not disabled enough (bipolar 1 ptsd anxiety bpd schizoaffective disorder) i cant even go grocery shopping at a decent time but in supposed to find a job and one that will let me take a 15 minute break every 2 hours,0
i had testing in the fall there was a computer test and iq because even after being stable for a few years i was still having extreme difficulty focusing my results surprised me but showed adhd without a doubt and i was started on adderall adderall was the missing piece of the puzzle for me it made a huge difference in my life especially at work best of luck to you!!,0
2mg abilifly for me works great i take at night started at 10mg and lowered the dose until i and my doctor felt it wasnt making me like a very quite personwhich i am notnow for about 2years i have been at 2mg enjoying everyday right now life is pretty good my anxiety attacks have been few and far between personality is up i can get manic but i dont get depressed too bad anymore hope your meds help you out like me just work on the dosage with your drgood luck,1
yes i think mine is anxiety but i blame everything on that,1
dude major time because you want all the pain for yourself you want to hold them up so high that nothing can ever harm them ever again but all you can do is love them reassure them and make the shop of horrors as bareable as possible it is very difficult though i dont believe its impossible,0
i have bipolar 2 and i am pregnant with my 4th child my oldest two have mental health issues (not bipolar however my 7 year old has rapid mood swings) it can be passed down and i am always scared for that i would hate for my kids to ever feel how i have felt but i think my chances of them not getting it are pretty good if they end up with it at least i have experience with it i was diagnosed a year ago and three of my kids are 3 7 and 10 it is hard to parent when my mood are crazy but i try my hardest,0
i just simply use an alarm on my phone and keep a small travel daily pill box with me,1
are you seeing a dr on a regular basis? you need to open & honest with the dr & tell them how much you are struggling you could also ask about counselling services that might be available to you so you can work on some strategies to help you feel more in control blessings ,1
not always some people do have that and their kids as well i have depression and anxiety plus my boyfriend and my daughter not all people are fake think before you speak please!!!!!,0
take in the am it kept me awake all night when taken at night i was put on it for night terrors due to ptsd and it has been 99% effective for me,1
i forgot to take mine today i really wish i hadnt ive been out all afternoon and even with my bf and my service dog my anxiety is much higher than ive gotten used to handling,1
recently i was started on effexor i also am on topamax welbutrin (weird i know) and buspar i also take prasozine or mini pan at night so for me this works but you cant just go off any med cold turkey without having side effects that could be life threatening! you are also the person who is ultimately going to be affected by the med so you should be the one who should have the most say in what goes in your body!! be proactive! get educated on all the drugs the can treat our condition! the information is out there on google print out the sheets on each drug know what has and hasnt worked for you keep really good records for those times when you wont be able to think straight or when a loved one will need to get your history if you get hospitalized i have been in this boat since i was very young and back then there was no one for me even now it is extremely difficult to slogg through the mental health system i have been through hell and back again i am seriously considering starting a blog to talk about what i have been through in hopes to start a conversation about what to do and what not to do my boyfriend and i also want to start a suicide support group there simply is anything out there for those of us who came back and now must find ways to cope with what happened and keep the light burning,0
im just having a hard time right now everything is irritating me ,0
i am on combo of effexor and lamictal as well and it is the best i have ever been however i do suffer from the shakes restless leg syndrome and tiredness but havent ever had a rash and this is the second time i have been on this combination,1
dont listen to people that know nothing about the illness i can understand how you feel like you arent yourself its like your cant control your thoughts or emotions my daughter suffers bpd so i see her struggling every day you need to find a good psychologist that specialises in mood disorders and does dbt therapy medication can help but not always~sandi~,0
be careful im no doctor but that sounds like a very scary mix! i wish u the best,1
i can see how it looks and i get down on myself when it happens but sometimes everything seems too heavy too much too overwhelming,0
both my teen boys take prozac and trazadone (antianxiety that also aids in sleep) both boys are asd melatonin caused night terrors after 7 years of no sleep the doctor finally put them these meds quality of life and sleep has improved in the whole house,1
im really sorry and wish i could do more to help  i was reading through the comments amd saw alot commenting about bipolar? i have very similar situations with suddenly getting really depressed and sometimes it even goes to serious anger and irritation in secondsdoes that mean i could be bipolar?,0
what is the medicines for anxiety!,1
kava kava helped me with anxiety before i had meds you can get it at a local health food store like sprouts its where i got mine,1
i take abilify for bi polar it is used across the board for depression to bi polar it changed my days from paranoia depression always sleeping to have energy paranoia gone i do have a sleeping tablet for my bi polar maybe ask your doctor about abilify it changed my life,1
why is the fear of rejection so paralyzing,0
i wish i had the answer just know youre not alone ive been like this a lot myself the past few months it finally got to where this week i went on fmla / short term disability from my job til june 15 thats been a huge relief right now im trying hard to at least do one thing a day my bipolar "all or nothing" makes me struggle to keep up with housework bcuz i feel like i "have" to do it all in one day and thats too overwhelming my first step right now is trying to tell myself do it lil by lil well see hugs,0
i couldnt sleep last night at all and have woken up in a horrible upset mood ughhhh,0
i have bad anxiety too was in buspar for it but it didnt help nothing seems to help ,1
im sorry you are feeling so ill yes sleep anxiety can wake you up anxiety can really mess with sleep and can cause stomach upsets try looking up mindfulness there are phone apps as well its a way to help treat anxiety it helps me a lot especially if i start to flip out before bed its a way of focusing on the present and leaving anxiety behind all the best,1
i have bipolar border line personality disorder and n other conditions anxiety depression insomnia etc i smoke weed daily it really helps me stay calm n my mind dosent wander as much best medicine im on,1
i have alot of days i struggle with that too,0
blood pressure is good,0
if u genuinely got bipolar its best to avoid taking any drug as it can make psychotic episodes go from terryfying to dangerous,1
i have the most problems with sleep too i take a sleeping medicine my mood stabilizer makes me sleepy and my doctor still proscribes xanax to help with my anxiety all that said the thing that has helped me most is listening to guided meditations as i go to sleep and practicing meditation during the day - even just being quiet for a certain amount of time and breathing slow and easy if you have iphone theres an app called meditation studio that i really like it cost like four dollars but theres no other "in app purchases",1
everyone reacts differently to medication what works for you might not work for others i was taking clonazepam and reacted badly im now on buspar seroquel xr zoloft and tegretol along with weekly counseling this combo has definitely been helpful i still struggle but its no where near as severe as before its been about 2 years since ive been hospitalized or had a suicide attempt and it definitely helps to have a good psychiatrist that you feel you can work with and understands your issues,1
i understand about getting married especially since youve been engaged that long its like why propose in the first place if he didnt plan on marrying you? if he cant do that then its a show of not being able to commit and now that hes changed? idk i would sit down and have a long talk with him about his intentions and where he wants to be with you and why he doesnt wanna get married communication is everything dont let the anxiety talk for you either write down the points you wanna talk about while in a clear mind,0
ive been on 300mg lamictal for years and will never change from that the only thing i found that worked for me was seroquel xr along with due to depression and anxiety i use benedryl yo go to sleep every night im trying melatonin for something different lamictal at night also and that makes me groggy,1
im all the above and to my family and friends sorry for hiw ive turned out but pease take me as iam or just dont bother speaking to me and except me as iam sorry for any embarrassment i bring on my family but i really do need you all to understand how iam,0
all of those saying they dont struggle are the 40%,0
this fucking suck this is one of my main problem i hate anxiety! i wish theres no pstd so i wouldnt act like this! this is very hard to change sometimes,0
i ve stopped takin mine(medicines) by my own been miserable for a while but i feel better now i kept my self busy i ve learned how t act n breath n specially how to keep calm n fly away on my mind til my pannic attack is gone was a nightmare still but i feel better n bout the pills im not taking it anymore been long time im on it but thts enough thts what i said,0
i have both as well it really is shitty the doctors are right thats how were wired start a journal and each day keep track of your moods any suicidal ideation if you become obsessed with this go to hospital immediately,0
ive been fantasizing this the past few days feeling a lot of anxiety these days too fight or flight?,0
firstly you are definately entitled to vent and i can imagine it would be extremely difficult to be in that situation its not fair that you are working so hard and losing sleep and are clearly struggling because youre exhausted can you make different arangements for the animals to sleep maybe in another room or something or maybe you could try a different sleeping arangement i think it would be a good idea to see a psychologist or consellor for yourself as well and try talking to him about how everything is affecting you maybe you could go back to the doctor or a counsellor together to try to find a way to make things work better its great that he has made improvements though,1
hey leah im sorry you are going thru this it can be completely overwhelming one of the things that this illness does is rob us of control over ourselves and our lives i am a firm believer in regaining much if not all of that control back! rick has found an excellent way to not only regain control of his body but also his thought processes he is acting in his own best interest as a coach! one of the three pillars to regain our health that i espouse for all of us feel free to contact me and ill spend some time with you and see if i can be of help james,0
my daughter is 4 we talk about feelings we talk about mommy getting grumpy and "snapping" and how sometimes emotions are too big even for grown ups i may go off in the moment but its how you handle the aftermath that is important address it when you have an angry moment i explain fully why i yell sometimes im scared (for their safety) and yell to stop them from getting hurt sometimes i get so frustrated i laugh i explain that emotions are difficult and that my behavior isnt ok but we have to keep working on it and talking together all of that with my 4 year old she gets it when explained on her level (bipolar and anxiety disorder here btw) find a simple way to explain that sometimes you cant help your moods but you are working on it tell her to help if needed by maybe hugging you if she thinks you need it maybe an outside "warning flag" before you get too upset? it might help the biggest part is explaining that she is not the reason you are that way everyone is made differently and your brain is just a little different and thats ok ,1
great when you try to go bowling but cant because people are watching and you have a panic attack woohoo! then your boyfriend starts yelling at you and asking you why you arent bowling and you just try not to cry like sorry im like this????,0
oh i know eric grace i was on xanax for years and years and was put on klonopin instead it helps alot with my anxiety though and it helps me sleep at night,1
ya and it doesnt help my anxiety and panic attacks,1
he needs to see a therapist for some cbt if they can do it via facetime or skype it would be great to get that in then pinpoint what started the anxiety did he have an attack one day and then fearful of it ever since to the point that its now become so disabling? is he a veteran? ptsd? seems that its the negative self talk and thoughts that are getting to him right now by not being able to go out i take prozac buspar and xanax when needed i know you said buspar didnt work but how about trazadone? therapy is honestly going to help him in conjunction with the meds,1
why take yourself off meds not every manic episode is a fun  you will crash and get sicker dont risk feeling stable,1
not to dismiss people with serious social anxiety but some people are just wired differently (like add shyness stage fright etc) its what this society defines as normal ill get off my high horse now,0
im afraid of the hospice too but do what you gotta,0
thanks for sharing your story i too am in that tunnel of darkness and confussion are you lds? i am and im so thankful for my blessing and church but i too keep pushing it away just from the fear anxiety and depression ive got myself on a horrible ride and i just cant get off good luck to all of us in peril,0
i have yet to get through that movie and its been two months lol i doubt i will ever turn it back on again ,0
i myself have a mental illness both of my parents have a mental illness i know my fathers mother had several mental illnesses i was married to a man with bipolar and mild schizophrenia my current husband has anxiety but i couldnt go through a spouse with bipolar again even though i have it myself,1
dont stop your meds unfortunately they are not a cure they will help you feel better for a while and then your mood can shift you may need a med change but therapy like dbt (dialectical behaviour therapy) may be really useful learning to manage your mood changes can be really helpful and make them less frightening talk to your doctor i hope all goes well,1
alarms on phone!!!,0
some heavy pain you are carrying there im going to try and respond to the aspects youve mentioned as best as i can firstly i dont think anybody here will ever say they know what you are going through we all know that every persons condition is different we might have similar diagnosis but how that condition affects you is not how it affects me friends and family who say this are most likely only trying to be there for you sadly it can feel as an insult but there is nothing you can do about other people with regards to your people pleasing behaviour well ive found that most of those suffering from a mental condition are in fact always people pleasers we give unconditionally to the point where it drains us its hard to focus only on yourself because you dont want to feel selfish take it from a person who used to be a doormat look after yourself and if you have time and energy you can see if you can help others lonely wanderer well i think it sums up many of us here our conditions trap us in our minds and its a lonely place personally i have no friends either this is by choice as i have certain expectations from anybody who wants to be in my close circle i dont trust easily due to the once bitten twice shy syndrome does it bother me? not in the least faith and belief yeah well what can i say for some it works personally i want to vomit in my mouth when people tell me to pray etc ive seen and experienced too much in my life to believe in anything that cannot be proven suicidal thoughts at are worst we all have to deal with them how you do that is up to you does it matter that others dont appreciate you dealing with it on your own? hell no if it works for you then they can go fly a kite do people care about your pain? maybe but at the end of the day most people are selfish and care about their own issues only we all get tired of fighting this endless battle in fact i have been stable for 4 years yet after almost dying last month coming home to the same shit i actually wished i never survived does it make me weak? no the fact that im still here means that im a tougher cookie than most people anyhoo i know i cant take the pain and frustration away from you but i hope that you will be able to see that even though we are all alone essentially we are also surrounded by millions who are fighting alongside us to survive through their pain,0
when my hands get sweaty its the first sign along with shaking of a panic attack but this started way before i started effexor i havent noticed any worse sweating after starting it,1
im on 375 of venlafaxine currently 250mg of lamotrigine and also either 75mg zopiclone or 10mg zolpidem plus occasional diazepam i know the venlafaxine dose is pretty high and were working on increasing the lamotrigine too bipolar 2 with anxiety,1

im so sorry youre hurting i too have ptsd but moved far away so as not to be constantly reminded i dont know your circumstances but would suggest changing your routine to avoid seeing them if you can and if youre not in therapy maybe look into it? its helped me a lot,0
tip: dont listen to your feelings when you are alone and scared sometimes we have to ignore our feelings and do what we know is best for us feelings can be sorted through and resolved once we are safe and feeling secure hang tough just go dont think just go,0
i would say over medicated is an understatement but that is purely my personal opinion i can tell you from my experience though that i too was on a huge combination of meds started​feeling overmedicated and stopped taking them huge mistake i now only take 1500 mg of depakote at bedtime because it does have side effects that i dont notice taking it at bed time klonopin for anxiety at night as well as my zoloft at night,1
didnt notice it helped at all dr switched me to celexa cant really say i feel that helping either but im bipolar/ptsd/gad/panic attacks as well so that might be why im on other meds as well sometimes wonder if any of them really work i have good days and bad days seems like its just gonna feel this way from now on not sure how i feel about that but thats my two cents and then some best of luck to you a good friend of mine swears by her lexapro and she has depression and mild anxiety,0
and its not the same as anxiety!,1
on gabapentin and lorazepam gabapentin more for diabetic nerve pain i am type 2 with anxiety take wellbutrin paxil buspar and trazadone for indomnia,1
i used to take the pill to prevent migraines and heavy bleeding i struggle with taking my meds on time because of my depression i recently talked to my gyno about this and she suggested that i switch to mirena which is an iud that also has a low dose of progestin so far it has worked wonders i dont have to worry about forgetting to take my pill and my periods have basically stopped i have spotting for a week every couple of months but thats it good luck i hope you find something that works for you,1
obsessed with philosophyto the point where like in the matrix took the red pill no going back the "human world" as opposed to the natural world seems so strange to me,1
new meds they say give up top three months to be fully effective however he should start seeing some results within a few weeks i would suggest if his tension and such is high which is understandable maybe find things that might take the edge off while hes adjusting if he likes the gym nature hikes video games drawing a hobby perhaps something to charge his focus from baby even for a moment might help,1
my issue is i havent seen a shrink i have panic disorder and ptsd so bad i barely leave my house as well my pcp doesnt seem to get that when i ask for a referral for a shrink i dont want to speak to a male shrink they keep forcing me to go see male shrinks i wont go my trauma stems from a male i have to get a referral from my pcp or my insurance wont pay for it i havent worked in over 2 years and my savings is running out,1
seroquil scares me  i stopped taking it because it was making me sleep walk freaked me out,1
i know exactly how you feel im the same and dont bother at times talking to anyone including my partner i dont think people realize its just a struggle to even get out of bed sometimes i dont think you should drop your partner try and sit down and tell him exactly how you feel if he loves you he will do some research or buy a book to understand the illness avoid the judgemental unknowledgeable people see if there are group out there who has the same illness as u so they can relate to how you are feeling these people understand so good for your soul seek professional help to see if u are on the right meds avoid negativity in general or zone out if u cant avoid them,0
oh wow me too im on 2 bipolar med and 1 anxiety and i still have sexual urges all the time but not as bad as when i was single at least im not promiscuous anymore i took too many chances back in the day im just glad im not having to deal with consequences like hivrealky lucky,0

yep that was me yesterday feeling guilty too but i finally had to tell myself to stop for one thing im 3 weeks sober (again) this wed im trying hard to stay sober for my well-being but alcohol was always my social crutch!!! i just couldnt go yesterday unless i drank to ease my anxiety so i made the best decision for me and stayed home sober #babysteps,0
my sincere apologies to all who i offended yes brigitte garvin as that trauma induces mental disorders thank you for your time signing off this website i thought it was for folks who had mental disorders and desperately seeking insight from others who also are seeking any and all insight ill try anything that has worked for someone else just to feel a little better just remember cmx ,1
thanks for your reply i hear that from a lot of people about kids giving them hope being without kids though i cant really relate to that one very much i hear ya on music though i have to listen to music everyday so many songs give me a sense of meaning and empowerment its almost as if theres a continuous message to be taken from music that everyone can relate to your comment does help because i dont get out much and dont have any friends really (my own fault- social anxiety) and to hear from someone who i can relate to on some level also gives me hope thank you,1
i am super sensitive to noses too i get irritated very easily to any kinds of noise i never really thought to tell my dr though im on so many meds im not sure they could help w this i have no polar and anxiety disorder they might just tell me to get over it lol but for real noise is a huge trigger for me! i snap out!,0
made me incredibly tired severe weight gain night terrors and terrible nightmares caused an incredible sugar craving as well i went up to 800mg a day but eventually stopped it,1
definitely number 2 always feel overwhelmed when it comes to cleaning the house be nice if the house could just tidy up after itself :),0
epival seroquil and xanex bi polar 1 ptsd anxiety after 17 yrs on lithium my liver is messed up liver and kidneys matter!!!!!! watch your enzyme counts!!,1
it caused me all sorts of problems i had drug induced narcolepsy and dementia! it really really didnt agree with me i sat in a meeting for a hour and panicked 2 days later thinking id missed it! my partner was with me as said i fell asleep 4 times and kept forgetting what i was talking about!! then i scored 0 on my pip what a joke!!!!!,0
you really need to see a doctor no matter how scared you are we all get scared and anxious it would also be helpful to see a therapist hoping you feel better soon ❤,1
i take effexor and that is one of the side effects i have to use a fan it was horrible for me last night when we lost power!,1
we would all be very disturbed by what we found,1
story of my life i struggle with these things daily,0
i went through the same thing since i was 16 i did research cause i knew the way i thought and the way i acted didnt feel normal to me as i saw everyone around how they were i got diagnosed 2 years ago and i was right that i was bipolarits a scary thingthrough that time my mother would tell me youre not bipolar just cause you look at stuff on the internet and when i got upset she always threatened to put me in the hospital and always called me manic now ever since i was diagnosed she asked questions 1 time and never talked about it since so i feel yougo talk to youre doctor cause if you feel it you might be,0
its not fair to resort to "leave him then" all relationships take work and dedication through everything hardships included throw a mental illness into the mix and it gets difficult to the max my husband and i both suffer from mental illness and its an almost daily struggle to not lose our shit but we love each other we are dedicated to each other there are times when it feels like he doesnt understand my predicament and theres times i act like i dont understand his but at the end of the day (or week) our love prevails dont give up and just "leave" when theres enough love and dedication to survive through the storm its not easy but nothing worth having ever is,0
first: you are getting help pat yourself on the back for this or give yourself a hug - well done that is the first step on a scary road! secondly: all mental health units feel scary as they can have noisy (and nosy) people there what you have to remember is that these people dont judge you need help and that is what they are there for tell the truth try to explain how you feel others are there for the same reason as you it takes some time but there is light at the end of that horrible dark miserable tunnel! it doesnt seem like it yet but the light is there! you just need a hand to help you find the light switch i have been where you are it is terrible and my heart goes out to you truly strange as it may seem you will meet some great people in the unit who are similar to you but who have been there a few times where this is your first time take some deep breaths try not to judge yourself too harshly and take each day as it comes we are all here for you❤️❤️❤️,0
i dont want to sleep  see i got ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression for sleep im stuck sleep brings nightmares n night terrors when im awake i have flashbacks so im double fucked  then bi polar n anxiety n depression hits so thats a double wammy  no wonder theres times i just want to end it all but i keep fighting second by second so i can do it all over again to see another day  to start it all over again ,1
i think this is a reasonable concern for someone to have granted the way they went about it is horrible and sounds somewhat biased off of basic common stereotypes it is still something that could be very serious in the future if it does turn out that way when you have a kid that should be your priority and you cant allow your depression to prevent you from parenting your child granted i am of the mindset where my own parent had it i have it and i have become terrified of passing it off even further i still think its a valid question,0
i deal with anxiety on a regular basis i have to calm myself down first then start my breathing exercises usually goes away in an hour or so,1
i get all shaky and hyperventilate,0
i didnt get the rash but i got the itching and the itching was horrible! my stupid doctor told me to keep taking it i fired him and got a new doctor,1
i feel exactly like you but i am older i have no life no friends i cant go out i am full of shame and guilt on top of anxiety and depression i have a binge eating disorder i have gains 100 lbs i lock myself away every day i want to kill myself and soon that day will come cant stand the pain anymore,0
ginger right its a struggle but my experience has been that its a lot harder to fight the daily troubles outside of my control without the medication medication isnt a "cure all" but once i decided to stop listening to that internal demotivational tape that has always played repeatedly in my head about how weak i am that i to need medication or how society is right about how im foolish to think i need medication then i started to realize that these meds improve my quality of life and more important than that; it improves the quality of life for my wife and four children dont let the thoughts that have always tried to destroy you keep you from doing something that helps you live,1
first you need to find some way to get you those feelings workout self harming a way to redirect your focus something you might like to do read a book colour paint research family tree information hiking journaling something that can perhaps inspire you in a more positive manner than you need to find someone you are comfortable with communicating with if it is a parent a relative a telephone hotline you need to sort out some of the chaotic feelings you are dealing with i find talk therapy with a psychologist seems a bit hard but i found one i loved and all these feelings may start pouring out and it releases some of that anxiety and tension you need to find a good doctor you after comfortable with to help you with the possibility of meds if thats what they think you need having choices is really important and i hope you realize you arent alone just this year ive had such horrible lows ive been so overwhelmed ive self harmed but im determined to be happy im fighting so hard dont feel ashamed to say how you feel or ask for help dont forget to take care of yourself it can get better❤️,0
citalopram also called celexa is an antidepressant and can also help with ocd and anxiety any antipressant is hoping to take a good few weeks before you feel any benefit it can be increased to recommended maximan daily dose of 40mg any medication can have side effects which you should find listed on the information leaflet however if you are showing symptoms of psychosis or bipolar disorder for instance these need to be diagnosed by a psychiatrist again if you not in uk system will be different,1
keep you& kids safe first you may also be if it from counseling if something happens to you or your children  you run the risk of losing them you can still try and helpfrom a distance until he decides to really get help,1
yesterday i laid in bed crying because our family had its first ever family reunion people flew in from across the country it was at an amazing place close to me at a hotel on the lake all my cousins there who i love and hadnt seen in years and i chickened out and didnt go!!! i was soooo mad at myself i looked forward to it for months my cousin paid for the whole expensive affair and i couldnt even show even with my nearby parents and siblings going who im close to ive missed nearly every holiday in the last year i know there is nothing to feel anxious about and im an extremely confident person!! i also never care what people think of me yet when it comes to family gatherings or friends parties i stay in bed we have a disorder we cannot help it!!! i wasnt overthinking at all yesterday yet i couldnt stop crying to get up & get ready i share this bcuz youre not alone! and dont let anyone make you feel guilty!!,0
confusing as the change between up and down can be as if a switch has been thrown thats what it feels like to me,0
im on lithium 900 per day mg and lorazepam 3 mg per day as needed and quetiapine 800 mg per night and divalproex (dont remember dosage) i have depresion anxiety and bipolar i need all different meds because they dont work anymore except for the divalproex;its new still having hallucinations and horrible anxiety and mood swings,1
i agree with babie i had to threaten my mom with not having a relationship with me if she didnt stop treating me badly for being sick i know that sound mean but what she was doing and saying was mean and i just sat her down one day and firm but respectfully laid it all out on the table the more i kno about being bipolar and the more i look back my mom was too just untreated but if she stopped for my health i would have had to walk away and with your spouse if they cant be supportive than thats not how ya love someone,0
everyone on here is giving you excellent advice never go off any med cold turkey i went through hell and back with a horrible psychiatrist who set me back by many years my first suicide attempt my second attempt and now med changes my current doc is wonderful she agreed to ween me off effexor and she is doing it in a way that it will be months before i am fully off of it so far i can deal with it because i know it is going to be there please be careful,0

kenneth seronick yes i talk to my doctor im working on getting some help me with it because its hard for me to control a lot of times i just feel alone & stay to myself i take medicine for my anxiety & depression but low dose,1
i think i get anxiety a lot when im overwhelmed then feel worthless when i get nothing done because im so in my head i think it would help to schedule out your day & go crazy on simple "to do" lists that way you can take your day one step at a time & feel good about the things you get done hope that helps,0
i have been able to cut my meds in half with medical marijuana saved my life i take my diazepam just a few times a month if i get night terrors i still need rx meds seroquel at night to sleep and as a mood stabilizer two birds ,1
totally relate to this people will never know the constant struggle :(,0
breathe in for 5 seconds hold for 3 exhale for 4 thats the way i do it but that only helps calm anxiety and doesnt really help my thinking personally i drink a lot of whiskey and pop an opiate but i dont recommend that for anyone,1
so much that i havent been able to listen to music of any kind because it only reminds me of a sad memory that causes anxiety panic attacks which causes you to go backwards instead of forwards dont wait til it gets worse please!,1
my 13 y o is on that combo and it works for her bp and anxiety - shes been on it for many years - she was also a zoloft baby - as i took zoloft throughout my pregnancy bc back then they deemed it safe - same with my son - he was a zoloft baby too and he has been on zoloft now for his depression anxiety for almost a year :(,1
its a struggle daily not to self harm  i hope i made it through this day,0
ive got epilepsy and anxiety but some people only understand the epilepsy and not both together and the damage it can cause,0
theres the "text book" answer & then theres the personal experiences/ symptoms that are unique to each person who has bipolar its a mood disorder that is unpredictable debilitating paralyzing with depression anxiety etc,1
you dont sound crazy at all dont worry about sounding crazy,0
its a life of struggling but ive come far enough to learn how to enjoy and learn from my struggles and i have a couple friends that know me well and understand me assnd never have they given up on me that kind of support gets me thru a day also having adhd added to the list of my life makes some days go by thst i cant even remember em but i still love my life most of the time lol,0
the struggle is real since turning 30 getting hard to manage my symptoms,0
depends if it is two separate voices that sound different or like me i call them lots of "me" trying to talk to me in my head at once which get more noisey if i am anxious or depressed x,1
ive never been on lithium yet i say that because that could be nextive been on probably over thirty different meds & combinations a lot have dissociative withdrawal symptoms it gets sooooo confusing after so long i got a heart condition with one that can be deadly but goes away when you stop itim getting tired i cant tell so i just go to my dr and report side affects to mental health sad someone would leave a client without a referralnot good,0
saphris i even just got the horrid taste in my mouth just thinking about when i was taking that ,0
for god sakes stay away from abilify! it does permanent nerve damage talk to your doctor about the sweating sometimes changing the dosage or adding another anti anxiety drug can help the most important part is to talk to your doctor and make sure hes listening to you not just pushing pills at you,1
thanks its not always easy but i have to push through cant let my kids see me struggling on my bad days i sometimes have to go in bathroom and splash water to cover the fact i was crying but my kids (17 & 10) keep me going along with my therapy cat,0
pip welcome to the rollercoaster called bi polar the ups and downs some days you dont know which way is up i was undignosed through my childhood finally went in myself and i have bi polar 2 with borderline personality disorder but i dont let my illness define me yes ive been through the gammot of meds doctors who dont want to help me but if there is one thing through all these trials i have learned is people with mental illnesses are some of the strongest people i have ever met we fight against ourselves on a daily basis just to survive i know your young but that means you have a fighting chance to change your life it will be a struggle some days will be impossible to get out of bed somedays youll have so much energy you will feel like tigger! but if you ever find yourself in that dark hole where it doesnt look like there is a way out make your room as dark as possible turn on your favorite music sit on the floor close your eyes and breathe i promise it will help good luck pip and remember we are all here for you you are not alone in this fight,0
i hate what ifs!!!!!just do it do not be scared! be a lion !,0
people helping need to really understand this it is so easy to put on a mask when leaving the house for short periods of time but thats not the whole story and most pain is below the surface it takes allot of strength for the one being helped and the helper to go below the surface it can be messy and stressful but in the end it can become very therapeutic have empathy not sympathy,0
yes amen my be hurting so bad i just want to die i just learn last year that i have anxiety and depression,1
especially when they avoid eye contact while being your partner ,0
im on anxiety/depression medicine,1
this mentality is why i am not prescribed helpful meds for anxiety,1

perspective: opium is all natural many drugs are obtained from plants all natural isnt better or worse than drugs that are manufactured in a lab and unfortunately it sometimes mean unknown and changing concentration of the active ingredient which can lead to overdose it can also mean made in someones kitchen and contaminated cause they were distracted which can make you sick or worse and certain all natural remedies can interact badly with some medication st johns wort should never be taken with antidepressants that are selective serotonin or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors the interaction can be very bad if you want to add a "natural remedy" it is also a drug and you should talk to your doctor before taking it better safe than sick or worse,1
the peoples who really have an anxiety issue please dont use it  it will make you vacillating so after using this you are unable to focus on anything and feel like a crazy human !! ,1
oh good my anxiety went through the roof then,1
same i just graduated high school which was hard for me due to many absenses cuz my anxiety and depression made it hard to get out of bed or concentrate my whole high school life (all of school actually) i had hardly any friends or they were just people to talk to about assignments no one knew about the real me tho idk how they didnt see my crumbling mental state the only way i got thru was my twin giving me love i didnt deserve and i told one of my trusted teachers when i was down my advice is to try to find an adult you trust and ask for support or forthwm to just listen my mom worked and i dont talk to my dad so i found a new father figure in my brother who helped me tons thru out my entire life you will make it youre also my there!❤️ i almost died junior year from one of many suicide tries and trust me this year will go by fast i care about you pls dont do anything tonight that will hurt you cuz i love you ❤️ you are so strong look how far youve come ❤️ keep your head above the waves beautiful❤️,0

worked well for me but nothing on diazepam but was took off of that after i needed 10mg+ to calm a mild panic attack and that would then cause me to crash and being a single mum it wasnt good i was on 80mg twice daily and it helped take the edge off,1
my x girlfriend is bipolar and has other mental health issues she is also struggling with an addiction to crack  we just recently broke up after 7 years she lives in oklahoma and we have had a long distance relationship for the past year she has been on a sabotage pattern she has been cheating on me with anyone who gives her any kind of attention she has really ended any feeling l could ever have again with her i was somehow trying to talk myself to think all of what she is doing is because she is in a maniac state rt now she has been off her med and not even concern about seeing a dr she says she says she is clear headed and is more like her real self than ever she has been saying some very hurtful things to me about being with other people  i finally had to block her from every outlet it is killing me to see her in pain but she doesnt seem to care about my pain anymore i have had to get in depression and anxiety medication due to all this i dont know what else to do?,0
keep fighting those demons! they cant win if you are still fighting them fear is from the devil himself youve got to fight harder than any "normal" person could ever fathom! little things are very hard for us but we are the strong ones because we live day to day with these struggles and are still here i believe we arent given more than we can handle and youve got to fight for life!! none of this is easy i dont sugar coat anything but it is so worth it when you get to see your beautiful children graduate marry be a grandparent you are on this earth for a reason and you need to talk to your doctor regarding your meds or go straight to an er! dont let the demons win you are worth so much more!! ❤,0
after a week being i am scared to be home or going out anywhere i suffer from the same things you do i cant handle being in any store unless my husband is right by me or i will freak out,0
its like people dont even read its more of the lying to her clearly saying he wants to but lying about it and the fact that their relationship has changed and hes clearly not invested in it i have no advice i live by the rule of do i spend more days happy than sad if not whats the point for me it got to the point i wanted to kill myself i felt so horrible theres something to be said for having stabilityespecially for kids but if yall are miserable and not connected they pick up on that a conversation needs to happen clearly though focus on facts not feelings,0
i have been on bipolar meds anti-depressants anxiety meds sleeping meds adhd med etc spent time in amsterdam (where its legal) found that marijuana treated all these problems they are even more affective than what big pharm has to offer now that you dont have to smoke it i cant see any reason not to use it medicallyexcept its illegal even if you qualify the clinics need your other drs approval i really dont see that happening too often most drs want to keep you as a repeat customer so most drs arent going to give approval,1
a few -- 4/7/8 breathing is breathing in for 4 seconds holding it for 7 seconds and exhaling for 8 seconds that switches us back to the autonomic nervous system and calms the whole body another is a multi mineral supplement (trace minerals 2 witjout iron ir copper) and added magnesium anxiety and panic can be caused by zinc and magnesium deficiency alone sometimes niacin helps me with rumination and compulsions,1

hydroxyzine is amazing for pain or if youre going through withdrawals from drugs or coming down from drugs and seroquil worked for maybe 2 weeks for me i took it for sleep but then i started getting restless leg syndrome and muscle spasms would be up all night you also gain a lot of weight on seroquil so be careful!,1
ive been where you are feeling like there is no other option but death is sad and scary :( ive been hospitalized quite a few times for suicidal thoughts and attempts this can be a lonely and scary time please know that all of us care and hope you can get to a healthier emotional place soon!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️,0
so many stories about depression and anxiety no one says what to do to get better ,1
i have attempted suicide when i was younger and i suffer from depression and anxiety to tell someone that is dealing with those diseases that suicide is a selfish act is wrong you can not make a person who is already feeling an immense amount of guilt and anxiety about themselves feel even more guilt and stress by telling them to think about their friends and loved ones in those desperate moments of suicidal contemplation they probably feel incredibly alone and misunderstood making them feel worse does not help their brains dont work that way they may even think that by killing themselves they are doing what is right for their friends and family they may think that suicide is actually a selfless act i am not saying that suicide is the right way i am just saying that if someone is contemplating it instead of putting them down for it try and understand why they are feeling that way try to encourage them to get help,0
olanzapine is the best drug to be on is you have either bipolar or schizophrenia my diagnosis is changed from time to time i am definitely bipolar but at times the features of the illness change where there are paranoid themes delusions and random voices this is called schizoaffective and it is possible to swing between both spheres im from australia and initially olanzapine was only prescribed for schitzo disorders when i was put on olanzapine i have been the best i have ever been most of the time only problem is an issue is weight gain and severe munchiesif you had full blown schizophrenia you would not be able to hold down a job you would be crippled by the voices and psychoses and not be able to function well in society go with it bipolar can be great when its not out of control for motivation creativity artistic persuits and holding down a job and doing it well the self harm thing has never been an issue with me but there are therapies that you can use to stop that destructive behaviour im told its a distraction from the pain that you may be going through i wish you all the best,1
i was able to drive fine on klonopin it lowered my anxiety enough so that i was able to actually function its all on how you respond to the medication,1
i dont know what advice will help but know that youre not alone! we all know struggles like these and most of us would hug you if we could hang in there try to do something for you!,0
also why be reluctant to effexor? lithium is the most dangerous psychiatric drug out there and you are on that so why be reluctant to one as harmless as effexor?,1
manic for me is just restless and agitatedno grandiosity certainly doesnt feel good anyone else feel the same?,0
how very good people can be so heart-warming lisa in this sometimes terrifying world much love to you brave heart that you arex,0
sometimes friends get overwhelmed when you depend upon them too much all the advice given here is very good do not be afraid of the doctors or therapists you just need to take the time to talk to them plus group therapy might also help you might also want to stop going to a bar where it makes you feel more lonely think about other places that you might like to try i went to a library and just read a book there were lots of people around me but it felt ok and safe,0
actually while weed is effective in treating several mental illnesses such as ptsd anxiety and depression tests show that it worsens symptoms in bipolar disorder schizophrenia and others possibly even causing psychosis if you have bipolar disorder stay away from marijuana,1
for me the last thing i need is some made up bull shit about how god loves me and "we cant go on w/o you" its the misconstrued lies that make me fall further away this mental cage is a burden we place upon ourselves is a spiral spun the fuck out if you love this person and im guessing you do spend quality time make them feel they matter this hole is deep contemplation overwhelms us to the point of oblivion sometimes the best answer is silence along with companionship along with a smile this monkey is a bitch dude,0
my wife left me because of my bipolar disorder recently as well no children involved thankfully i dont know what im going to do either i work 1 day a week washing dishes at my familys restaurant i am a college educated professional and just cant work in the corporate environment anymore i have some some savings that im living on but it wont last forever im going through a bankruptcy and divorce at the same time too im just stuck i sleep and watch tv mostly try to exercise but have been failing miserably at that lately i drink too which isnt good just know that other people are struggling too i keep telling myself that things are going to work out but nothing changes,0
i have never admitted it before to a group i suffer every day i was diagnosed with "manic depression" back in 1994 now they say its a bipolar disorder ive got? idk what the hell i "have" but it is hard as hell to go through each day i was a cutter i did the suicide attempts and gained a bad liver and kidneys from it ive smoked weed and it helped but i would slip into these funks and it is so hard to get through them especially when im full of fear shame and self loathing during these times it is so hard to let people see me that way ive been struggling pretty badly today thats why i happened on here its a little easier knowing im not alone everyone who posted here reminds me of myself in one way or another keeping focused on the small positives helps sometimes i hope you find strength and hope each day in little and large things i always have to remind myself that i have control over my life thank you for sharing your story i understand how hard that probably was and how brave you are for reaching out idk about everyone else on here but when my loved ones watch me going through my episodes i just wanna hide or disappear sending hope and good vibes,0
well arent you sweet aint shit its a serious horrible thing to go threw ugh could say so much more because your response sickens me but wont bother not worth my stress,0
i was thinking the exact same thing when i was reading this i feel this way pretty much daily i suffer from bipolar 2 and social anxiety,0
it does happenwith bipolar one you are more dangerous to yourself and could end up badly hurting yourself with bipolar two its more self harmbut with medication and alot of positive thoughts you can copejust tell yourself when you in a bad situation this is my sickness tomorrow i will wake up and feel betterits a roller coaster our ability to copebut as any sickness we have to learn to cope and be strongbe good to yourself find things u enjoy dont worry about the past and what hurt you or broke you just live each day as it comes and it will get better,0
ambien is a scary drug i was on it for quite a while and the the same experiences as many others doing things i didnt remember the next day i now take temazapam it works fairly well but im groggy for about half the next day i only take it if i havent slept for a few days there is no easy answer to the sleep issue,1
eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (emdr) is a fairly new nontraditional type of psychotherapy its growing in popularity particularly for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) ptsd often occurs after experiences such as military combat physical assault rape or car accidents,1
does it not affect anxiety more though does it chill you out ?,1
i cant remember what i was on but i was having nightmares of my pawpaw and i was waking up around 2 or 3 in the morning staying up til bout 8 or so in the morning then go to sleep my doctor had to change it and then i switched doctors and i got put on celexa for my anxiety and depression,1
wtf? thats horrible to say,0
i always say acceptance is the hardest thing in life id kill to be the old me whenever ive tried getting off meds the bipolar comes quick irritable and full of rage and then i spiral way down into the depression i just cant handle that please stay on your meds i dont want you to die,0
dont give in to those who want you to fail and end your life mbr you have to protect your children no matter how much you truly hurt inside dont leave ur kids vulnerable to the sickos of the worldwere here for you! i cannot be there to give you a hug try and find a support group by you ( if any ),0

i like it i take it in conjunction with other medications i do however opt for the tablets versus the extended release i can miss a round of my meds and not be too off my game but will be slightly grumpy/more anxious like others have said you have to find what works for your body trial and error is a sometimes long process but having a supportive understanding dr is the best thing for you when trying to find the right meds,1
i think the relationship sounds like it could be good for the both of you as life is hard on all of us he might himself have mental health issues if nothing else it sounds as if his mom and stepdad are making it very hard on him to make his own decision and if you add that same pressure on him he might be in a type of stasis where he would rather not decide one way or another although he should be more helpful when you are upset who knows what he might be feeling or thinking at that moment it is up to you to decide if that kind of treatment is acceptable in your life and you alone if you love something let it go if it comes back then it was meant to be as for what you can do for you is focus on you and your son dont allow anyone to discount your emotions about the fire that kind of event is very tough and you never get over them but you can get to a point where you are at ease with the memory i try to think different about those situations like"i made it out and got me and my child to safety obviously i can handle my shit! im awesome and strong!" therapy is good for situations like this you get a different view on the things going on in your life you also have a safe place to vent and can get more out than what you just shared with us just remember that many here care enough to try and give you something to go on some kind of advice that hopefully will help and ease your pain even though its facebook and you cant feel our hands on your back to console you in your time of need we all do care about you and very much,0
yes ive struggled with this my whole life,0
i tried without meds and ended up in the mental health ward not a pretty place horrible staff and even worse food they take away your phone and you get fresh air 3 times a day the beds are horrible and you end up on more meds than you went in with if youre lucky you see a psychiatrist once a week and no councilling please reconsider taking meds depression just doesnt go away it sits in the back of your mind like people say you cant snap out of it it takes time meds and support,0
my onset was 15 with no adult helping me seek help i was diagnosed bipolar at 25 but not on meds that helped the highs until i was 33 they made me so numb and i took them for 2 yrs i hated the numb but it helped me see what i was doing to myself having sex with strangers was exciting in the moment but left me empty for weeks after the meds completely took away my sex drive and i started valuing my other qualities not just my sexuality im off meds now and i feel a healthier sense of self now then before everyday is a new struggle but im happy to at least feel more in control of my sexuality,1
just goo baby dnt feel guilty about growing keep on keepin on you got this!! only the toughest people go through the hardest battles shine bright sunshine,0
tracie camm southan cannabis can exacerbate symptoms you must know what strain youre smoking but dont smoke it vaper or eat it much healthier i had brain shocks coming off effexor horrible stuff,0
i stopped lithium suddenly in pregnancy and was ok but it is v risky look out for signs of relapse and seek help urgently or re start meds,1
i set an alarm on my phone,0
i was allergic not just a little allergic but the life threatening allergy they warn you about i got stephen johnsons syndrome so my exposure was very short,0
anxiety can cause us to put off making appointments i have found if i make a plan the day ahead and have the number ready it helps for me planning everything ahead eases my anxiety,1
that makes my anxiety sky rocket,0
i did not have a good expirience on itit made me horribly suicidalthen when i was getting off of it the withdrawals are like compared to getting off of heroin one of the worse anti depressants to come off of i missed 3 months of work feeling like i had the flu every single day it was awful,0
so you believe pregnant mothers who choose to take their doctors advice & stay on the minimum dose of meds that science & research has deemed safe to use will still have babies that are more likely to develop those disorders you mention? thats funny because i didnt drink any alcohol smoke take meds eat shellfish certain cheeses cuts of meats etc etc etc (whatever was popular at the time to not do & still constantly changes today) during all 3 of my pregnancies yet my 2 boys are both diagnosed with asd (autism spectrum disorder) adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) & gad (generalised anxiety disorder) & my daughter was diagnosed with add (attention deficit disorder) so there you go even mothers who think theyve done everything right still have special needs children! your ignorance is obviously bliss for you but for those who through no fault of their own are still giving birth to & raising special needs children its not so blissful want to know the actual truth? even science doesnt know how or can explain what causes such disorders!! so how can you think you have any idea?!!,1
yes sometimes i scare myself,0
its mostly difficult when theres no support people will just tell you to stop stressing and pray but when you cant control how you feel how do you get through the day? its really misunderstood,0
i understandive been hospitalized 3 times for same came out and started an out patient therapy and recovery center it seemed tohelp i learned new coping skills i truly believe this is why i look back now and see why i struggled so much in school and my past mirrage,0
same i think certain people in my life that once could not accept it are starting to i am the one who places the guilt on myself after i say i cant do something due to my anxiety ect not fun but in reality we have to take care of ourselves first,0
why is it we are in a group based on support and we are focusing on how someone is being selfish for committing suicide? do none of you making that comment realize the mind set the person has to be in already to make that life altering decision they dont currently care about their own existence yet you are expecting their mind to stop and concern with others after they take themselves from the pain and misery they feel currently? that is not the way to talk to someone with severe depression contemplating suicide they need someone to listen someone to talk to and someone to be there they need to feel understood heard and loved and that this will get better or that they are not alone struggling with this do not insist they focus on others issues when they have such drastic mental issues going on in their own mindset that they have difficult contemplating decisions already especially to use words like selfish when you fully clearly dont understand the extend one has to be to be that desperate to make that choice even if you do view it as selfish or not its a misunderstanding on your end not theirs and you are speaking out of being hurt by others actions you didnt fully understand because you couldnt help them,0
try one step at a time prioritize dont get to overwhelmed,0
i lived in my bedroom for three years because of anxiety for almost a year now ive been taking vybrid xanax and 5htp it has been working so well i actually volunteer three days a week now i only use the xanax in worse case scenarios i still primarily hang out in my bedroom but little steps go a long way! good luck,1
i take gabapentin for fibromyalgia but my anxiety is still really horrible i didnt even know it was prescribed for anxiety,0
some people will not acknowledge that depression anxiety and panic attacks are an illness imagine they will think different when it happens to them let me reassure you it is an illness it takes seconds just too ask how someone is try it maybe one day you may be in that position wondering if any of your friends and famiy care about you,1
u need to ease up on yourself with everything u been through that ive just read u are doing amazing well youre still working something ive not been able to go back to and youre taking positive steps as in going out whether youre sat on your own or not thats a brave and courageous thing to do again something i couldnt do u need to give yourself more credit for the things u are doing and try not to focus on the things that youre not as for friends!!! i understand only too well how gutting it is when your circle gets smaller and smaller but we need to understand how they feel being around us especially when were not doing too well my friend told me that she was scared at times of my behaviour and that she found it really really difficult to deal with she couldnt cope seeing me like that and i do get it i was terrified at times over how i was how i behaved how i couldnt function whatsoever and how i was emotionally and mentally that being a complete wreck!!! so i can imagine how she must of felt i wasnt me at that time i was a nightmare to be around i laughed one minute babbled rubbish at a million miles an hour the next making no sense at all i ran round like a loonatic cleaning etc then the next thing i could be crying sobbing screaming and wanting to kill myself yes we have a daily battle with ourselves sometimes just to get out of bed but we also have to look at how difficult it is for our friends and family to deal and cope with us wishing u well tx,0
that is so wonderful you have someone who understands and is supportive i have bipolar disorder 1 as well as major depressive disorder ptsd and panic attacks beyond normal my husband has been by my side the entire time and has even gone to classes to learn more about my disorders we are lucky to have such wonderful partners ,1
i too take seroquel it has done wonders for my sleep cycle and i now get the sleep i need i also take a high dose of effexor (antidepressant) and buspar (for anxiety) this combination works well for me and this came to from years of trying other meds that didnt have the desired results i suffer from bipolar 2 severe depression and anxiety the amount of medication seems excessive but maybe you can eliminate some if they arent helping you im not a dr though so make sure you stop and start your meds with drs guidance good luck to you and i hope this helps wishing you peace and happiness,1
i used it for a few months and had to switch because of insurance reasons awful to come off of for me (i know everyone is different) horrible brain zaps and suicidal thoughts; constant crying weight loss no appetite i think the no appetite might be an antidepressant thing for me good luckhope it works for you,1
my ex husband is a narcissistwhen i confront him of every day issues like getting health insurance for our baby when i found out i was highly pregnant he said we would pay cash when and if needed to i then realized he did not want children i spent 2010 working with him to make our future 2013 married him2014 gave birth 2015 divorce due to my ex being a narcissist im recovering from depression/anxiety due to me giving up my life for my ex husband who is all about himself he has nothing to do with our child unless its court ordered it may be himand not you,0
i take 900mg 3 times a day for severe anxiety,1
why arent you on an atypical anti psychotic at night to rest? plus mood stabilizers to control anxiety and depression and benzodiazapines for spot relief,1
jules letellier yes being mindful of my thoughts i have a bad habit of living in yesterday which doesnt help my depression living in tomorrow which doesnt help my anxiety my mind roaming to the dark places and i get very consumed thinking about things that are happening in the world and i feel all those emotions that others are probably feeling as this devastation is taking place i feel empathy and sympathy for all the humans and animals that are out there right now suffering and being abused and i can get stuck there and it feels awful not so much accepting the thoughts but redirecting them to something healthier that doesnt make me feel so horrible like saying to myself if these thoughts arent going to help or change things then i need to redirect my thoughts to more positive ones its a very hard process but i do have a wonderful therapist and i dont know where id be without her small steps ,0
i also have an alarm on my phone for my dinner and evening meds i find this really helpful my morning meds ive never had trouble remembering as i take them with breakfast,1
it took a year of my psych working with me for them to finally say bp2 even with my history past hospitalization etc she started medicating and witnessed me in one mixed state and then headed into one hypomanic episode before finally shifting from major depressive disorder anxiety and ptsd to the bipolar it definitely could be bipolar from what youre describing just please be prepared for them to be cautious in making the diagnosis it takes time im glad youre taking steps and wish you well,1
the different types of cannabis work for different ailments indica sativa hybrids etc have to do your research i have used it for anxiety (indica) i do not use sativas cause they can make me have panic attacks hybrids are the varieties thats when you need to know names of cannabis and what they do to your mind body i take psych meds but have decreased so much that i rely on cannabis for pain management as well,1
everytime i get a job i go through this and i always end up quitting its a horrible feeling,0
i cant sleep and i try going to bed but my mind just races and i just think horrible thoughts and am so alone x,0
yeah i love the part where im so high and i believe god has given me a special power and i feel amazingly in touch with everything however when my body cant keep up with my brain anymore and i start to get close to falling then i really get aggravated and anxious,0
firstly dont assume anything unless you have a diagnosis secondly it looks like you are going to struggle in getting that diagnosis if he is over 18 and is either a threat to himself or others he can be sectioned under the mental health act as an adult he is also able to refuse treatment so unless he is willing to be seen by a health proffesional then he is going to continue to struggle unless you can convince him the his problems can be sorted if he does see someone good luck,0
im all ears for you i know recently ive been nothing but scared of myself im bipolar unmediated! im anytime!,0
you first need to work out weather you can handle this as this is not going to a one off if you can just be there lye with her hold her hand  sit with her just offer he a few reassuring words make her comfortable does she have a care plan of what she like when she poorly if not when she well make one so you have insight which help her it can be very distressing to watch and it normal to feel uselessthere not much that can be done apart from be understanding and make them comfortable and safe also look after yourself there is carers support out there too all the best all the best,1
im on seroquel have been for almost 10 years i love it its a mood stabilizer and given for sleep im on 600mg now but find that i wake up feeling refreshed didnt like the extended release because i felt like i had restless leg syndrome but the regular release works awesome before seroquel i would stay awake for weeks with no sleep in sight,0
thank you heather you have no idea how much i feel loved reading this right now i was able to talk with the people where i am and all is good im just really fragile right now from the way that everyone else has treated me that i was afraid they would do the same thing as far as the job i knew the new one was a problem and had to go because my health is more important; so i quit my therapist is wonderful and i do the work outside sessions therapists have said i actually process too much as for the dating situation thursday seemed to be back to our old friendship; but in a new better fresh way with him being more ready ive just been frustrated in the waiting and trying to cope with the pain of losing my friend when ive had alot going on and need social support my counselor has actually not discouraged me from never being in a relationship but to be cautious and let it happen when i am in a good place and willing to work at it he thinks the support would be good for me,0
i agree with you 100% but when i have to piss test for a job even though i have a prescription its still not allowed but i need something for my extreme public anxiety and depression,1
well i figure you should know its a possibility next time tell them you want it to be anonymous when they share a post of yours its not really paranoia when it comes to social media its a digital age and anything can be found if you dig hard enough or spend enough time looking just being honest if youre worriedmessage the page and ask them to take the post down,0
this pretty much describes me am i in denial about why i have depression/bipolar i really should probably seek help but there to i am afraid,1
i have anxiety issues as well i used to have panic attacks thinking about going and not sleep the night before now i look forward to my friday morning sessions my sister in law tried counseling and didnt feel comfortable with her counselor find someone different dont just stop going sometimes its trial and error to find the right fit,1

ive had severe depression severe anxiety and ptsd for the majority of my life i gave birth to my beautiful baby boy last friday and now im pretty sure i can add post partum depression in there ive been on meds but i feel like they arent working anymore i have a doctors appointment next week for it but for now i just feel like im spiraling my husband is trying to help but i just cant stop crying i love my son and im loving having him i dont regret him i dont wish him any harm i just am in a really dark place in my head right now,0
lexapro did nothing for me in the end basically all the ssris do jack shit for me when i finally got to meet a proper doctor i switched straight over to quetiapine it worked wonders for me and really helps taking a low dose when anxious unfortunately for me it wasnt enough to hold me so now take lithium and quetiapine good luck every med works differently for each individual,1
i want you to know that you are not alone i too suffer from these disorders along with panic ptsd agorophobia fear of ppl and insomnia many different meds though the years all i can suggest is therapy if youre not already going very important dont give up on meds there are sooo many out there unfortunately it takes time and the right combination keep trying if they dont work make the dr try something else also very important is if your dr doesnt work for and with you get another ive learned the hard way try to eat regularly (easier said then done) but force yourself if you have to get 6-8 hours of sleep if you can when and if i do sleep i seem to handle all the muck better and we all know exercise helps though very hard to do when you feel like you do at least for me i dont know if youre spiritual but i do alot of praying i pray for the drs to find the right combo of meds i pray for healing i cry out to our heavenly father and spill my guts he lightens the load theres a verse in the bible among so many others that i pray over and over again i can do all things through christ who strengthens me pick up the bible say a prayer for something in it to comfort you please dont feel alone if certain ppl dont understand dont share with them cry out to you dr and find ppl that are there im here ill listen reach out to ppl if you can i learned that the hard way too i dont know of any off the top of my head but ask your dr if they know of any support groups i hope at least one thing here helps you get as many suggestions as you can and pick and choose what works for you you are in my thoughts and prayers!! god bless you!!,0

medications always have side effects for my 34 year old son he is either constipated or running to the bathroom he has developed thyroid issues from a drug he is no longer on he also has bad acid reflux and is on prescription nexium depression can make you feel bad or imagine things and then when you really are sick it makes you more depressed this is from observing him for years my middle son also suffers from depression the you 34 year old is bipolar when my middle son calls me and tells me things that i think are unworthy of him worrying about when he is depressed i tell him to put those worries on the shelf they arent worth worrying about it has taken him a long time to learn to put things on the shelf but he is doing it now and much better for it god speed to you!,1
yeah my anxiety sucks baby,1
steps to loving yourself and living with this monster refuse to give him more power over your life i hope you dont think me presumptuous with my posts but lve been in the darkest pit but am gratefully coping okay nowadays when something bad strikes it knocks me down hard and i fear i may not be able to rise again but by the grace and power and by faith l manage to crawl back into the sunshine and oh how glorious that is wishing you lifetimes of sunshine <3 <3,0
ive been there too - i think what you need now is concrete steps to help lift you up just a little and then once you are up a little you can start to help yourself out of this here are some concrete steps you can take that will help you feel a little bit better within a week - please try them!! the biggest problem with depression is we do not even try the steps people advise us to take because we dont believe they will work do them anyway please!! 1) get at least 9 hours sleep per night - if you cannot sleep by midnight take one tylenol pm - this is the safest sleeping pill on the market if it makes you too groggy cut it in half and take half a pill but whatever happens you need to sleep 9 hours per night 2) make it a regular sleep - go to bed at the same time each night (9:30pm for example) and get up at the same time each night 3) dont drink caffeine or alcohol - if you love coffee get a decaf coffee substitute - there are nice tasting ones out there if you like to drink fruity cocktails replace it with orange juice and lemonade mixed together (tastes just as good as cocktails) with cranberry or cherry juice added if you like 3) get a counsellor and book an appointment every week for an hour each week if you dont have health insurance use online counselling like talkspace - google it 4) every day go for a walk for at least one hour outside - not in a shopping mall - outside where you come into contact with nature in some way even if you hate the idea of going for a walk and everything in your body is telling you not to go for that walk go anyway if you can get a friend to go with you or family member or whatever 5) dont eat sugary or fatty products eat foods that are as close to straight out of the ground as you can even if that sounds horrible please do it it will really help 6) attend a support group - emotions anonymous is a great one - often local churches and mental hospitals have support groups for people with depression - find one and attend - i know its very very difficult but you will be so glad you did! i know these steps sound completely impossible but please try them - they will help you feel so much better if you are in that place where even these simple steps are just completely impossible consider full time therapy as an outpatient to a local mental hospital,1
depression n anxiety go hand in hand make it hard to function efficiently,1
the problem is that the two are linked there are a number of mental illnesses which can lead to people drinking and becoming dependent some mental illnesses include self-sabotage impulsivity and risky behaviour as symptoms saying people have a choice is true but you have to realise that not all people are weighing up the pros and cons the way a healthy person does because they cant make their brain function that way not because they wont they are less capable of making the correct choice because of their mental illnesses if you havent resorted to self-medicating great i dont self medicate i have self harmed as a coping method though which is also a choice but also a symptom of my mental illness we need to see addiction as an illness because people cant get out of it on their own because addiction can lead to expensive illnesses (cancer liver damage psychosis depending what a person is addicted to) and because illness can lead to addiction (both self medicating with drink and drugs and becoming addicted to prescription meds) it fits between illnesses and therefore has to be considered an illness there needs to be support for addicts and education to prevent addiction and support for the families of addicts stigma stops people seeking help its no good asking people to stop stigmatising one illness if youre going to actively stigmatise another yes addicts need to take some responsibility yes they cause their families an indescribable amount of pain but we cant breed stigma we need to end stigma so that people seek help help which might benefit them and provide a better future for their families,0
everyone hates me as well as i really really hate myself dealing with bpd depression ptsd anxiety really bad flash backs makes it worse it much more then hate,1

yes ive been seeing psychiatrists for nearly 30 years first just depression then cyclothymia then bipolar and anxiety then bpd,1
people are more likely to accept a physical illness than a mental illness because major depression bpd and other mental conditions affect personality which can be seen and is most likely unpredictable in other words it scares them,1

read thiswe are all broken but our brokenness serves a purpose my pastor shared this little story todayits good the cracked pot a water bearer in india had two large pots each hung on each end of a pole which he carried across his neck one of the pots had a crack in it and while the other pot was perfect and always delivered a full portion of water at the end of the long walk from the stream to the masters house the cracked pot arrived only half full for a full two years this went on daily with the bearer delivering only one and one half pots of water in his masters house the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments perfect to the end for which it was made but the poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection and miserable that it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do after two years of what it perceived to be a bitter failure it spoke to the water bearer one day by the stream "i am ashamed of myself and i want to apologize to you" "why?" asked the bearer "what are you ashamed of?" "i have been able for these past two years to deliver only half my load because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your masters house because of my flaws you have to do all of this work and you dont get full value from your efforts" the pot said the water bearer felt sorry for the old cracked pot and in his compassion he said "as we return to the masters house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path" indeed as they went up the hill the old cracked pot took notice of the sun warming the beautiful wild flowers on the side of the path and this cheered it some but at the end of the trail it still felt bad because it had leaked out half its load and so again it apologize to the bearer for its failure the bearer said to the pot "did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of your path but not on the other pots side? thats because i have always known about your flaw and i took advantage of it i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream youve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my masters table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house",0
cymbalta was hell for me increases anxiety times a million body aches very panicky tried giving it a chance to work but it didnt and coming off of it was worse after a few days off of it i felt so relieved and much better ive heard the opposite for other people- some say its great ,0
hi there so sorry for all your troubles with so many anxieties youre dealing with negative circumstance will only add to your dilemma you seem very confuse even on little things and i understand because of the mental illness i would suggest a simple step its still up to you though since you know yourself better than i do (1) get a piece of paper and write down all your problems (2) put big problems small problems in a column and think through which one you want to prioritize first then second third and so on this might seem silly to you but our perspective normally change when we see in writing that some problems are not really worth worrying too much about and yet some problems also needs quick action on our part ❤️ this might help as well see the link take care ❤️ ,0
it scares me to be manic i feel like ive lost control of myself i dont know if that makes sense,0
can you find another psychiatrist? i would suggest doing that i know its frustrating to be on meds but if youve found that they help you have every right to get that help can you contact your primary care doctor? (i apologize if others have already written the same thing i havent read all the comments yet) i wish you the best! dont be afraid to advocate for what you need as a human you have a right to have someone help you with your mental illness please take care and update us if you get a chance i care even though i dont know you,1
mine is different but i relate i go from suicidal to euphoric when i am level (if you can call any bipolar level!) my mind still races sometimes so much i cant sleep for days when i am low i hide behind fake smiles and try not to go out much in my manic stage i talk incessantly and i am sure some want me to shut up i cant help it i get anxiety and become agoraphobic for a while i dont manage stress well i cry a lot and scream when it all gets too much i can now tell what most of my triggers are and have a great network and coping strategies i wasnt diagnosed until my 30s and still havent got a number i do get very upset with my head as i have horrible thoughts unfortunately i am also an empath so anything bad happening to others affects me a lot i cope i get through each day and sometimes i shut down thats life for me,0
you can find it on the iternet they have it in vape form and in candy form too im still doing my research on a company that sells online before i try i have a chronic disease as well as depression anxiety and bipolar,1
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be used only as needed for panic attacks in the moment works wonders and youre not taking it all the time only when needed it works almost instantly when used,1
i was on geodon for a long time and i did have tremors they werent bad but annoying make sure to tell y our doctor if it is bad there can be damage happening and the tremors can be permanent in some cases i had a very bad time on geodon for other reasons and despite complaining to my psychatrist for almost 2 years he refused to take me off it finally when i got better insurance i went to another doctor who quickly weaned me off (he worried about my side effects and the high dosage i was on but it was a more powerful drug than my symptons called for),1
you mentioned bad thoughts many people with bipolar disorder have psychosis at one time or another during their life they put you on an anti-psychotic medication (usually temporarily) even though it feels embarrassing taking an anti-psychotic medication it takes away the bad thoughts & made me act normal again i realized the bad thoughts werent caused from my depression although it did make my depression worse the underlying cause was psychosis its hard for bipolar people to keep regular sleep schedules lack of sleep can bring on psychosis,1
wow ! i may have to private message u maybe we can help eachother out im only 3 months pregnant but i think it is some un treated post partum with my son and having him 15 weeks early :( stress didnt help either but i wish i didnt have a fear of taking it i dont know what it is about it just scard idols only 10mg to start with but congratulations on ur baby ♡,1

marilyn corrado sorry hun didnt mean to upset you but i also understand how emotional it all is and how big a toll it takes on us all your son sounds as though he has the best parents all we can do is try our best they will always know how much you have helped them we put our heart and soul into supporting our children regardless of age and yes as you say it can feel such a solitary journey sometimes but im sure as a family you are a strong unit and im sure you will all do your utmost to ensure he has a happy future stay strong hold on to your dreams x thank you for your kind words too ill walk over hot coals for my children the other one is profoundly deaf so they both still need a huge amount of support but we ll soldier on take good care of yourself too thats so important x,0

i think that you are really going to have to be straight with yourself!!! sounds like you are in self destruct mode you want so desperately to feel better but then on the other side you do not love yourself or even care if if you live or die you are being pulled in both directions thats such a hard position to be in sweetheart you have to make a pact with yourself!!! you must be compliant with your medication!! what do you have to loose? be honest with your doctor and tell he/she about your non compliance ans see what suggestions they can recommend do you live with someone that can ensure they can take responsibility for them to dispense  watch you take them and monitor your compliance? please try and stick to it have faith in yourself its only up to you to make the right choice! live or die ?? you get one chance at life i know it can suck im in that place right now myself but there are also so many opportunities also to experience joy love happinesss and peace dont waste your only chance at the gift of life :) i know it can be shit and it can also be a wonderful experience too only you can create your own future xxx good luck beautiful girl!,0
my moods are leveled out but its definitely not a "quick fix" or "happy pills" i still struggle a lot,0
i have shared this words so many times ill share it again if an incurable disease has invaded your life refuse to let it touch your spirit your body can be severely afflicted and you have a great struggle but if you keep trusting gods love your spirit will remain strong,0
i suffer from severe anxiety cant leave the house most days depression; negative thoughts overwhelm me i self medicated while on my prescription meds with weed and perks and i actually feel goodhappy energetic but doc wont give me them,1
dont worry nobody knows how to do those things,0
when your ready to be on your own youll know if your scared it may not be the right time to come home ive spent several times in the hospital when the medicine and mind set is good then your ready,0
this is me most days its usually something stupid: your work colleague giving you a look your manager criticising your work then the black cloud appears its hard to shake off the obsession with turning the words over in your headits painful you just feel fragile,0
because others will not listen to my conversations about my agony due to my nervous systems lines of communication being tangled in unbearably painful knots  (victoria orango),0
its true most bipolar and anxiety patients suffer with yoyo sex drive bt this is due to meds according to research i did sex is almost non exsistent so it takes u and yr partner to work together to make it work so dont just say its not der  make plans hv date nights snuggle take showers and baths together help him and make sure he gets back on his meds gv it tym your will settle into a routine from there the skies the limit god bless,1
read the product rundown online youll find an info sheet it will give a list of minor and major sid effects and instruction to immediately discontinue use or seek urgent medical advice for any extreme effects im not familiar with the drug itself but they will all have some side effects and in most cases they are worse at the start until your body gets used to things also make sure youre eating well and drinking plenty of water one of the drugs im on er blocks me up so i can get stomach pains from that dont be afraid to tell your doctor youre not comfortable with the drug and ask to try something different but at the same time if its a minor ish side effect (eg constipation) then it might go away of its own accord or be fixed with a change to diet etc,1
anxiety is not knowing what you want in your life,0
 this has helped me through a lot calms me down when i get in panic attack mode,1
my best friend has borderline ptsd schizophrenia bipolar depression psychopathy disorder anxiety and compulsive lying disorder and she blames everything on me my family and her family and daughter instead of taking responsibility for her actions she keeps emotionally abusing us and manipulating us with lies and is very controlling and treats us like crap and hurts us she refuses to get help and she demanded a break from me because she claimed i didnt understand all i ever tried to do was get her to get help and take responsibility for her actions she wont get help and its hard on me because im autistic and cant communicate properly i have aspergers so i misinterpret social situations and cant always express myself correctly and i get emotional meltdowns due to inability to communicate plus i have depression and anxiety so its hard on me dealing with my best friend she just wont listen i wish she would get help and stop blaming everyone else for her problems and i wish she could see the pain shes caused me i have caused her pain with my meltdowns but i always apologize and try to understand but she just wont its hard to know what to do anymore because nothing gets through to her people judge me too and reject me when i get too emotional for them to handle and tell me to handle things myself plus i complain all the time because i can be a drama queen at times so its very hard dealing with this because the autism community has it especially hard because we want to be accepted for who we are but instead people refuse to be there and try to change us into something we are not its just so unfair and overwhelming dealing with all the ignorance,0
it will be a safe place a place where people will make sure you are ok just remember that there will be others just as scared as you you will be ok!,0
i cant make simple phone calls or answer them that stops a lot of thing currently flowing in my life to continue to flow with ease i rely to heavily on my partner to do simple things i should be able to do even like going to the doctors to getting my anxiety dealt with seems like it takes months of coercing for myself etc,1
for scary id go the strangers scares the life out of me everytime lol xxx,0
look into cymbalta it works with both depression and anxiety,1
honestly move on without him he may be on a high right now probably on his meds but has it been long enough to be very sure he will remain on his meds? will he spiral out of control and hurt you yet again? all these doubts all these question can you honestly tell yourself to ignore your own conscious? first and foremost your children are against any relationship with him because they suffered right along with you after he broke your heart and then tried to kill himself can you truly say his love has more worth than your peace of mind or the peace of mind of your children? i personally would place the wellness of my children and myself before any man no matter how much i love him please think things through before making any decisions you may regret in the long run many blessings to you and yours,0
i doubt that been alone way to long seems law of averages would have come in by now ha,0
yeah you have to see a psychiatrist at least once a month and when youre applying for things like this its better to get your psychiatrist to write you a letter to give as proof as they can describe it better?? well for me that was easier as i struggle putting emotions into words but its hard to get taken seriously they mainly consider those who also have major physical effects too so like with me  i black out alot and become unresponsive but even with that information i have still been rejected,0
totally understand i feel like i have lost my life; i have lost my career my finances my identity my role in life the very essence of who i was born to be i have lost relationships as i struggle to get out of the house and commune with others my youngest [adult] child has moved out so now i live alone with my little dog & two cats for company i sleep on the lounge as im awake all night in front of the television then sleep all day which suits me better than having to endure the long hours of the day i waver between deep dark in the hole depression & a more moderate but just as debilitating mood i frequently spend time thinking about suicide to the point of planning my own funeral the only thing that really keeps me going is a healthy fear of god - we all have an appointed time to die & ultimately its gods decision when that is living with bpd & other mood disorders is mentally physically & spiritually exhausting i grieve & long for the woman i used to be,0
i take lithium (1200mg/day) and seroquel xr (600mg/day) im still not sure if thats the right combo for me because my anxiety plays tricks on me so its hard to tell im seeing a therapist for my anxiety instead of taking more meds,1

i have a lot of issues with side effects and latuda has been one of the few ive been lucky with and i feel it has helped me my moods are not as out of control as they were and it helped a lot with bipolar depression i take it with my dinner each night to avoid stomach upset and im fine,1
people do make me irritable on those days i just try to avoid contact speak only when i have to,0
very true and is not what we want is a dark struggle and hard battle mental illness self harmed and eating disorder we live everyday and we still alive and survive for live in this earth but mostly peoples for ignorance dont understand you and only condenm you and dont permit us talk about this for them condemn and unkind talk and comment about this some humans dont have compassion and not in our shoes for know and understand this,0
you are not alone therapy along with the right medication can help tremendously if your psychiatrist isnt there for you find a new one who will be i cant imagine what stress you have gone through in your life but know that god doesnt give us more than we can handle you are a strong man and you will find the help you need when thinking of harming yourself remember that your kids need you when i would have harmful thoughts i would remember my family i can do this youll be in my thoughts,0
bobbi nicole sullivan from my perspective yes maam drives me into a pit that i cant climb fast enough to get away from depression and anxiety go hand in hand with each other for me anyway,1

yikes! a lot of anti anxiety meds! i take wellbutrin in morning be careful with valium very addictive and dangerous my opinion so talk to your doctor about it❤️,1
part of this disease is to worry about things that may never happen overthinking is a tough hurdle to get over keep it in perspective and learn how to talk positive to yourself encourage yourself you can overcome those kind of thoughts be your own best friend,0
nope getting mania in the summer is common- increased sex drive is also common and being angry at the drop of a hat is also common- you have just given textbook symptoms of mania in bipolar disease though it will be hard to do you need to get back on your meds- you need at least a mood stabilizer to get the mania under control stopping and starting the meds does nothing to make the disease better and will give you more heartbreak over your life yes the meds are awful and have awful side effects- you need to work with your doctor to find the best ones for you- just stopping without discussing the side effect that is driving you crazy does you no good and does not let the doctor help you figure out how to deal with it an example- i am newly on buspar for anxiety- it was causing double vision every day for about 5 hours- i really hated that- instead of stopping i talked with the doctor and he made the suggestion to stop the morning dose and just take a bigger dose at bedtime-tada no double vision in the daytime and i could care less if i have it while i am asleep i have had bipolar 1 for 45 plus years or so and diagnosed about age 24 (i am 60) trust me the range of medication options now is so so much better than in the 80s- do yourself a favor and start seeing a therapist a couple of times a month to deal with the emotional fallout of you life and being bipolar and get back on the meds- they are the key i wish you well in the journey we call life,1
its really just a matter of opinion my therapist today said that theres two sides to depression how you think and the imbalance ive been on seroquel for 8 years and due to insomnia i too only get 2-4 hours of sleep without it which is the leading cause of my issues (depression phobia related anxiety add gad) his way of putting it is that the prescription helps you put on a different pair of glasses until you can handle the sun again on your own i really liked that,1
use to happen to me all the time when i just got over a really long manic episode it wore off the more stable i became it was frustrating and scary good luck just be patient with yourself,1
pass is the same as clonazepam sorry had to research we are in different countries but yes i take "paxam" 1mg 3x daily for anxiety keep in mind is it very addictive and withdrawals just dont miss your drs appt,1
izzie radford-nash - saying everyone here has mental illness so we understand your situation is completely untrue and destructive to say my ptsd anxiety depression etc experience is not identical to emma-janes or anyone elses nor are theirs identitcal to each other so yes you have some glimmer of insight into others lives with the same condition but just because you fight similar demons doesnt mean you understand theirs,0
dont be afraid you will meet the king when you pass,0
if you have never officially been diagnosed with depression or anxiety i am guessing that means you have never been given therapy or medication to help? please please please get to a doctor asap and tell them how you are feeling pregnancy hormones definitely intensify emotions and you can get much needed help from a good doctor if the first doctor doesnt help or doesnt take you seriously go to another and another until you find one who does your life and your childs life are valuable,1
i can so relate to how nemo is feeling right its been a few weeks and the constant stress and lack of support doesnt help,1
i think i agree with you carol mental illness requires a holistic approach you need encouragement in terms of biblical upliftment medication and therapy i believe its vital to anchor oneself especially as mental illnesses bring about anxiety self-doubt etc etc also lots of self-love positivity and a cherished support system are necessary,1
if they have you on medical leave and you will be paid then i would take this as a blessing dont stress on it but rather take this time for you and get better,1
if it aint broke dont fix it changing psych meds can be life altering; and in some cases life threatening when disclosing your medication regimen to others you will receive all kinds of "advice" even from professionals do your own research on fda warnings for your meds avoid "word on the street" advice most importantly listen to your own body and mind,1
i took it it reflected that the drugs that hadnt worked for didnt metabolize well in my system it also said i would be good with benzos which is kinda true because after two weeks my body was so addicted i to them that it took months to wean off of them ( highly addictive drugs but i didnt know that) so it was accurate it can help you avoid things that wont be useful to you,1
have you tried saphris its not availible as a generic but when everything else gave me adverse and highly unwanted side effects we tried it back when it was fairly new and i have been on it since in combination with lamictal and ativan (bipolar ii rapid cycling schizoid effective disorder moderate ocd anxiety ptsd with panic attacks) it is hard to find the right combination but once you do if you ever change dr fight for what you know works and then go from there (side effects of saphris i have noticed tungue numbing sensation up to 1hr after sublinguil then it it has completely dissipated [taste ask for script to be written for the black cherry if no cherry allergies the cost is the same if you have medicaid it will cover this med ] sleepiness until regulated into your system,1
be glad you are alert and oriented in because thats really really even more scary when you are hallucinating and do not know what is real and what its not because ive had a psychotic episode with this it just got so severe with my ptsd but im really really glad that youre getting help honey please take the help its really going to be okay,0
if ppl do stop meds good to reduce slowly and make sure ur life is stable/ stress free,1
i agree with so much of what you are sayingi was diagnosed bipolar 20years ago now l have far greater problems with depression than maniastruggle to get up every day and totally hide away wont answer the ph or door push everyone away hate been seen wont reach out or go to dr just inside trying to distract myself with books puzzles film and feeling totally worthless,0
im scared of what i did im scared of what i saw and most of all im scared of never feeling the rest of my whole life the way i feel when im with you,0
i have anxiety depression and ptsd and they put me on prasozin and i saw an increase in my night terrors and sleepwalking last week they switched me to trazodone and it seems helpbut the hangover affect sucks,1
this!  i have literally been on every single "mood stabilizer" on the market i gained weight with all of them some more than others and it is not just serotonin and appetite! they mess up your metabolism! so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they are right every med has a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lost weight but i agree weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! it is a huge thing and it affects your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self worth!! (and really self worth is a part of all the others),1
im so sorry to hear that and i wish that i could give you some hope i have a congenital heart defect which was only found when i was 19 years old (told i was just a lazy unsociable child) had some side effects with that (low blood pressure blackouts depression) but had 1st pacemaker after the birth of my eldest child now (lots of years later) jan-april 2016 had 4 pacemaker ops due to complications; have been treated for depression anxiety sociophobia & insomnia since my husbands death 6 years ago and had to give up a lifetime job which i loved pip was stopped in february causing many problems cab has been extraordinarily helpful in appealing and re-appealing but say even if its good news ill hear nothing until october i feel guilty still knowing that this is being done to people who are dying and im lucky but it sucks good luck to you and please get a support worker or go to citizens advice bureau! *(( hug ))*,0

the second time i attended therapy having being diagnosed with mdd + psychotic features the therapist said i have so far displayed an emotional and dissociation disorderwhen i asked him later during the weekly sessions he told me to continue taking my meds because they are not addictive and also commended me for my courage and consistency to attend therapy sessionsnonetheless the posts on this page has undoubtedly made me realise that i have bpd looking back at the years  the ups and downs feeling like a child despite all the birthdays passing by pushing loved ones away and after longing for them  irrational fears attachments issues hypervigilant teary identify crisis etcooh and the biggie childhood abuse (incest) i am keeping well in the well of ups and downs through gods grace and strength,1
good luck!!! deep breathing try to relax its normal to be nervous! its an uncomfortable feeling but it cant hurt you believe in yourself and do your best i wish you all the best keep us posted!,0

the lamictal rash can progress to stevens-johnson syndrome which is life-threatening so you did the right thing stopping the med but you still should have seen a doctor at the onset of the rash notify your prescriber asap and get to the first md you can see - urgent care or er or whatever blistering/peeling skin can be a sign of sjs did you/do you have flu-like symptoms too?,1
praying for you hosp should help tremendously go to groups n stay involved for best results everyone is there w their skeletons to so no shame in it,1

i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when i was just 11 and everyone says to me that i am no depressed just upset  but i just dont want to smile as i have nothing to smile about anymore and am not intrested in the things that i used to be intrested in my behaviour changed when i was just 7 but i didnt think anything of it until i was 11 and then i knew and 24 now still fighting it,0
yeah i usually am good about taking my meds the pharmacy took forever to fill my depression meds because they had to get a pre authorization if im not taking them i become maniac and high on life my counselor knows when this occurs lets see when i have anxiety attacks usually i take my pill or i breathe or i shake until it goes away by talking myself out of it,1
yes when i met my last girlfriend i felt obsessed about her shes since left me i still think about her every day and it kills me,0
so the thing about that is that intentional motional reactions can have a physical side effect its no joke that we tend to store our pain our suffering  or even our stress into our body it may be side effects but its always a good idea to talk to your doctor,0
first of all that seroquel isnt gonna do crap at only 50mg i take 600-900 depending on the day the seroquel helped me cut my xanex needs in half so i dont get anxious as easily ive tried everything for about a 10 year period with no success until i started a mood stabilizer im bipolar and its all i needed,1

interesting point before i got treated i would list all the things weighing on or annoying me what i learned was that it was hormonal and brain chemistry caused i dont discuss my chronic anxiety or depression with most people i have a therapist to help me with that i do discuss my pain and exhaustion due to fibro because that disables me more visibly,1
worst ones for me are the shaking and the nausea,1
yes it can be terrifying especially when the thoughts of violence pop into your head ive always had anger problems that stems from the severe bullying i dealt with growing up,0

bipolar is not traumatic disorder but truama can be a risk factor,1
i hate the restless legs i get when i start to fall asleep,1
well u still shouldnt worry maybe she just needs a bit of a break its very hard on them too having us to deal with lol we are not easy people to be around especially when were ill tx,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page yeah smartphone is a contradiction case in point: ive got an ongoing battle with mine over its need to change the word "when" to "she" for absolutely no good reason i think a lot of the text style with the lack of proper words and the need to use letters and numbers has more to do with age than anything else while i do know some people in my age group that do the letters and numbers the vast majority of them text the way they were taught to write in school,1
i wish it were a choicel mean who would willingly choose a dark black holel am often challenged that l have this so called-choice and guilt is then heaped on me,0
im fed up of feeling tired all the time even if ive had a good nights sleep ive begged my dr for medication again but she says there is nothing that works with eupd yet i keep seeing everyone mention medication on these chat pages i miss being happy ive lost interest in all my hobbies and have to force myself to tend to put ponies everyday i cant sell them as they do help me when im out there (plus my kids would kill me) even my episodes are no longer a high where im bouncing around everywhere i cry scream rock smash up things and self harm to ease the tension the episodes are not as often but when they happen they are a lot worse to the point i scare myself i find it hard to talk to friends famy even my husband so bloke it all up inside ive spoken to my mum before and she ended up crying which made me feel bad as if upset her she cried because she was shocked by what i was saying happens to me so i wont talk to anyone now i issolate myself i wake up every morning and hate that ive woken up i feel low all the time,0
they gave it to me for my anxiety and depression and for the nerve damage i got in a wreak it helped nothing and made my anxiety and all much much worse,1
with out a doubt he need a straight jacket,1
i did seroquel with lamictal it gave me severe reactions ive been taking lamictal for years but the combination was horrible i now do lamictal with effexor it seems to work for me,1
if your niece doesnt know about what has happened to you and what youre going through i can understand that she puts herself first and is probably a bit hurt that youre not going to her wedding this said i dont think you should go to the wedding cause if youre not upto being around your stepfather which is totally understandable!! you shouldnt put yourself in such a position ever! especially not if you have a saying in it which in this case you do! if you should feel guilty towards your niece you can still pay her a visit to wish her good luck if she doesnt appreciate the gesture thats her problem! try to find at least one person who accepts you for who you are where you can rely on and understands that youre not always upto being around people  it makes a big difference if you have "a person" then you wont feel so alone you are worthy of having someone who you dont have to explain yourself to just being you should be/is enough! big hug to you!,0
horrible siesa,0
from the symptoms you described i would agree yoyare suffering g from depression its very common to have anxiety and panic attacks as symptoms of depression too i cant comment on whether you are bipolar but nothing you have described suggests you are as for bpd medication doesnt really help talking therapy and cbt and again depression anxiety can be co-occuring i would congratulate yourself for studying working and caring for your child that is so amazing and takes immense srtebgth perhaps go back to your gp there are lots of antidepressants and spme are particularly good for combatting anxiety and panic attacks alongside depression you are a star,1
panic attacks are real  if you have never had one then you dont know  true or not they happen everyday ,0
this is amazing im currently awaiting diagnosis but i can relate to so much of this thank you for posting this has helped me more then any of the stuff ive read this will definitely help me explain things better to therapist i feel like i am worthy of saving and getting better and you are to weve all got to stay strong and not let this horrible illness destroy us thank you again,0
propanolol is a bp med often used for anxiety by helping to keep your bp low usually you need more of a dx to qualify for any assistance ,1
i have mood disorder depression & anxiety as well im on 300mg of lamotrigine & 900mg of lithium it has pulled me out of the deep trenches but ive come to accept that i will never achieve full recovery or be cured some days i start to feel hopeless others im on top of my game i never know which it will be or when but thats part of the disease for what its worth my husband has seen a dramatic improvement since ive started my medication,0
why do you keep posting these?! support page? turning into a shame page tbh!!,1
im sorry your feeling hurt sometimes my husband acts similarly and i get so anxious since he at this point is just a friend i would let this relationship go you deserve so much better there are people that understand mental illness and are kind i will keep you in my prayers,0
wow i cant even read anymore how insulted i feel reading some of these comments of people so vehemently rejecting those with mental illness wow thank god i found someone who loves me and isnt afraid of me! damn! utterly disappointed in the overall negative view,0
i take lorazepam it helps my anxiety and controls my racing thoughts ive tried sleep meds and anything containing dyphenhydramine it doesnt work i understand your frustration,1
screw her! what she said was extremely demeaning and totally inappropriate i am experiencing a very similar situation the onset of my illness was 2012 i too have a 4yr college degree my employer told me that they needed to let me go after my husband and i informed my nurse manager that i had been recently diagnosed w/ bipolar i had worked there for 195 yrs and helped the hospital achieve certification as a primary stroke center based on strive guidelines published by the american stroke association i was finally approved for ss disability in 2015 my condition is starting to improve gradually so i am considering re-entering the workforce however i am very nervous regarding the ramifications of that decision does anybody have any suggestions based on a similar experience?,0
you always have someone  even though you wont feel like it a boy is a boy  boys are dumb and never know a good thing before its too late dont be sad  it just means he wasnt the right one you dont need anyone you have the love within you to be all you need all you need to do is bathe in the glory that is you everyday no one is better than you no one is below you  we are all just as confused as you take each day as it comes be it good or bad and get out and spread your sunshine everywhere xx,0
its hard i find it shameful being in this position im a strong womani shit myself off,0
you might not realize it but through the everyday struggles you endure i see a brave and strong woman who thinks shes on this journey alone shes not even when were not together im mentally by your side holding your hand and whispering i believe in you love you your #1 fan,0
latuda had better results but the cost is prohibitive with my insurance and with a strong family history of heart problems the fact that it increases cholesterol worried me and my doctor it also regulated my sleep schedule for the first time in my life im on 300mg of lamictal right now and it doesnt seem to be going much,1
you are absolutely not alone there are so many of us out here that are more than happy to be a good friend you see what my name is you are more than welcome at anytime you need to talk to pop up on my page or send me a message i dont want anybody to ever feel like theyre alone in this whole struggle,0
i took this while i was pregnant for a very brief amount of time it gave me serious insomnia and for about 2 hours after every dose i felt like my anxiety was actually worse,1
medications can do that but anxieties such as being overwhelmed,1
thanks everyone for your input i found out it was the start of a panic attack (weird because they dont usually start that way for me) i took clonazepam and it relaxed me and my breathing went back to normal,1
we call my yorkie stinkerbelle too! but usually because shes being a brat or is in desperate need of bath time,1
yes yes yes im so glad someone said exsactlly how i feel  ppl act like i can just snap out of my depression it dont work like that  ive been struggling for years with out meds  and right now im not in therapy and i really need it and im so alone and hopeless and my depression is suffocating me i just want to die my thoughts are so suicidal and dark and morbid and very negative  i cant control it there so intense  i did not ask to have depression cans anxiety but i do but ppl make me feel like its my fault dns im a bad person which lowers my already low self esteem ,0
i struggle with this daily,0
hello la rhonda im so sorry for what youre going through i understand the struggle and the feelings behind the sentiment and i know that its not easy id like to share these articles with you that has helped many faced their challenges in life in a better perspective hope youll find it helpful to your circumstance as well any question? please send me a message ill be glad to accommodate please take care ❤ ,0
in my dreams i cant ever read the chalk board writing its like its shorthand it makes me soooo depressed and i fall into a deeper depression i wake up crying and shaking and i pick up something and read and feel better,0
please feel free to express and even if you dont want to just dont do it pretending everything is okay is tough not only tough i think its just disgusting so stop it its you and only you who knows how u feel what kind of chaos going on in ur mind i had spent almost 2 years in bed just like doing nothing at that time only thought i had was as if am gonna pass away soon anytime hated everyone who tried to symptahize or help me then there came something and i really dont know where it came from i mean the confidence that i can be normal again will smile again and it took years to that nothing is permanent you are in same situtaion like me the soon you want to get out of this shit the worse it gets so be patient medicines do work but it takes time meanwhile you better quit seeing normal people do not loose hope after all we all fall down and its not our fault you just need to stop worrying about everything not only your illness but everything in ur life,0
stig we have all heard it!!! i heard it most from a mom whose sick made my sick sicker (if you can understand that) it took me a lifetime to understand my illness and the things that are triggers i am 45 for my mother to accept she had a mental illness she believed she was admitting to being "crazy" that great old stigmatism! she might take medications for a minute but when they started doing what they should she was " healed" and would quit taking them i learned unfortunately i am a much healthier (still bi polar still have ptsd anxiety panic attacks) but much healthier me with out my sick mom in it heart breaking as i have not spoke to her for over 15 yrs but i learned i cant fix her i can only fix me i do this with meds therapy and staying out of situations that can set me off ( its like a pitch black roller coaster ride never know which way its going to turn) its ironic right? my sick mom telling me i should be normal i was acting out for attention my fav its all in your head that one was right just not the way she meant it im doing great i do what i need to do to be healthy i cant say that for my mom her life is very sad i work hard to not be that person,0
her saying she hates you or the anger thats not her speaking thats the illness it may not seem like it now but things will get better shes very lucky to have your support and you trying to understand what shes going through i must say you are awesome and you should be so proud of yourself for taking these steps like some of the others have said just dont forget to take care of yourself as well you cant be there for orders if you are tired rundown or overwhelmed,0
i have times where i go through moods very quickly for me its most likely related to borderline personality disorder i do not have bipolar although i have heard that for some people with bipolar cycling that rapidly isnt unusual this being unusual for you its probably related to some sort of extra stress going on at the moment if youve got a psych you really need to let them know about this if you havent already,0
i actually found it more distressing than helpful,1
the last medication i was on i had very strong suicidal thoughts and i even "self harmed" so i have been scared to try anything else! thats why im not medicated!!!,0
i was on lamictal for my bipolar when i was pregnant my son cam out perfectly healthy but heres the thing my doctor gave me a choice and said my son could come out with a cleft lip so i went to an herbal drug store and started taking fish oil as it helps skin to grow and stay healthy and i also took omega3 for his brain activity and a few other herbal pills if you are unsure about your medications i would suggest taking over the counter pills like the fish oil and vitamin b helps with your moods too of course being bipolar and having depression it wont do as much as your meds will but maybe try n stay at the same dose and add vitamin b to it? best of luck to you and your little one!,1
m8 its so hard when u suffer from mental illness iam in my 30 and still struggle day to day to keep it together,0
<tl;dr> read about neuroplasticity change your habits change your habits research about neuroplasticity and how you can "rewire" your brain unfortunately theres no single method to get rid of depression ive tried increasing the intake of food thats high on antioxidants (even tried oil pulling hahaha) exercised meditate etc i have not tried psychotherapy though as my main pdoc says im not ready yet (still on clonazepam for my anxiety and sleep problems) what might work for you will not work on someone else so - its more on experimentation when im depressed (which is more often now i cry and let myself feel the pain and hollowness) <trigger> then i really think hard why im sad why i feel that way most of the time i cant find the answer so - im there crying for no apparent reason its so ridiculous i find it funny sometimes i dont think about suicide but death sounds inviting sometimes </trigger>,0
anytime the drs tweak your meds is usually a rough ride try to hang on while the new meds work their way into your system music helps meeither playing or just listening to it dont be afraid of your emotionsjust try not to add too much weight to them good luck & godspeed,1
basically you get anxiety attacks the post however describes panic attacks,1
2! no questions about it cleaning is one thing that gets my anxiety acting up real fast! and arguing with my kids to get them to help clean only makes it worse! so definitely 2!,1
is there an admin that can remove this brigitte person? people here dont need to be attacked for asking for help this is why so many people are afraid to speak up sad we all need to support one another,0
big bag of nope i dont wanna know my insecurities are bad enough and to hear the negative thoughts regularly? even when paired with the good it would be too much for me no no no no no no,0
doctors help with a lot and so do friends i know it feels as if everyone has deserted you and i have been there but through different support groups ive found the best friends a girl could ask for i had an ex husband and it took me almost 5 years to remarry bc i was scared of men too however i got lucky adhd is hard to deal with i was diagnosed when i was 21 i had a hard time adjusting but things got worse now i am on different meds to help i overthink about everything and it sucks i havent figured out how to stop but i do have friends and my husband to help i have been in your shoes and dont be afraid counseling helps a lot you just have to find the right therapist and the right program also lavender oils do help with stress i would recommend that i burn candles and wear a necklace i hope that helps,1
turned out once i stopped worrying about getting fat cause my pills i got better good luck,1
both my kids have anxiety and depression issues but because they saw me getting treatment from a young age and i got them treatment when they showed signsthey and i are dealing with our illness well and they even help me at times my daughter is having her second child and we already talk about treatment for my grandkids if and when they show signs of anything my pastor is the one that taught me to get ahead of this illness with my kidsif i hadnt it would be a mess it took me over 25-30 years to get my cocktail of meds and therapy rightmy kids only took 18+ months for thiers be pro-active is my only advice children are a gift and just because you have bipolar doesnt mean you dont deserve such a tremendously wonderful gift like kids i couldnt imagine my life without them god bless you,1
your meds may need to be adjusted i am treated for bipolar with anxiety at one polarity and depression at the other i take two kinds of mood stabilizers one an atypical zonisamide that emphasizes anxiety at night400mg standard dose then lithium 300mg slow release 3x a day then atypical ziprasidone at night for sleep i have a benzo as needed for anxiety at nighttime this combination works well for me,1
its hard ive been there many times if you have a good day you must be manic if you have a bad day youre depressed if you get mad or upset with someone for the way they treat you youre crazy and need to get your meds in check i wish i knew the answer,0
id say theres no question youre on the bipolar spectrum im bipolar i with mixed features my episodes are a lot more intense than yours at times but about the same a lot of the time adhd and anxiety disorders are also highly comorbid id see a psychiatrist as suggested by miranda,1

i have had a long struggle  i may look fine on outside i suffer from ptsd anxiety and deep deprrssion and tried to commit suicide i feel like people dont listen to me,0
it doesnt require "lived experience" but it helps well done for reaching out and finding someone that understands it takes great courage to admit that you are vulnerable i have bipolar affective disorder 1 and although i am stable  3 years now  and have access to a best practice mental health in-patient hospital with out-patient care on the darkest of nights  i have used authoritative online communities like bphopecom keep safe reach out get well,1
yes everything seems to come to a head at night all the days stress,0
depression anxiety disorder ptsd,1
ive had the same issue and all my life - im highly sensitive and my family life was a chaotic mess as my parents were narcissists and bipolar i went through hell ive learned a few things to share 1) eat healthy food at regular times per day 2) avoid sugary and fatty foods as they fuel problems 3) write letters daily to yourself write out your pain fear and anger put them in a safe place also write your goals dreams and things youre grateful for 4) listen to happy or classical music - proven to change brain chemistry 5) read about anger - its a message that something is wrong change what you can and accept what you cannot 6) be really compassionate to yourself no judging 7) learn meditation - online is fine hope these help!,0

i have never needed to really use meds to control my hyper sexuality thought i should expand i use thought censoring during certain situations and thats about it otherwise i allow myself to indulge safely in what my body craves maybe its because i have never viewed sex like most of society does from what most people respond like its not something to be ashamed of and not talking about issues like hyper sexuality just screw people up more of course be careful with whatever you choose to do but its ultimately your choice just practice safety in all forms ^^,0

i have bipolar i and borderline and every type of symptom that goes along with it i was a hypersexual child but i was never promicuous not that i will ever judge anyone that suffer with this my husband understands the fact that i am hypersexual we have had arguments about it in the past but he does love every part of my "madness"  there are many times when he is too tired or too stressed and those are the times i feel rejected or accuse him of cheating which is not true and it does drive me insane at times its "normal" ironically for someone thats hypersexual,0
wow you are going through a lot arent you unfortunately i dont know of a quick fix autism there is no cure as for your other disorders there may be medication that can help but they may start to notice a difference in a few weeks up to 6 there are some anxiety meds like ativan and xanax that can work straight away but most drs either dont like to prescribe it or only allow you to use it short term because its easy to overdose on it you can build a tolerance to it so you need it more and you can get addicted leaving you with something else to deal with one of the best treatments for anxiety and depression is cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness which either a psychologist or therapist uses you can look them up online there are a lot of examples of things to try particularly mindfulness there are even apps for your phone to help unfortunately this isnt a quick fix but they teach you tools that you need to practice everyday so you have them on board when you come up with a situation or feeling that makes you uncomfortable or anxious i really wish i could give you better news somebody else here might have a different perspective im just going on personal experience i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder and my nephew is on the autism spectrum take care,1
i know how you feelyou pick yourself up only to fall again its a struggle! bipolar is like that i try getting out in nature when im depressed or exercise but sometimes you be so tired i knowbut you have to push yourselfthink of yourself as a demanding coach for you to be better if you did it before you can do it again push through ,0

mixing and rapid cycling of moods alexander of tralles (c 575) wrote that individuals tended to have cycles of mania and melancholia and that "mania is nothing else but melancholia in a more intense form" by the sixteenth century jason pratensis had concluded that "most physicians associate mania and melancholia (truly dreadful diseases) as one disorder" by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries most medical writers thought of mania as an extreme form of melancholia doctors jean pierre falret and jules baillarger in the mid-nineteenth century formally posited that mania and depression could represent different manifestations of a single illness falret noted the strong depressive quality often occurring before during and after manic episodes as well as melancholic anxiety (touched with fire k r jameson 1993) yoga can help practice it in class or at home,1

hi there i just wanted to let you know that it really is possible for you to get past some of these things ive had anxiety (& depression) since i was 17 & im 45 now from there to here has been hell a lot but there have been and continues to be good times too im not saying its easy to make it through tough times and right now it sounds like a really really horrible time for you and im so sorry that you are going through this may i ask do you have a psychologist and psychiatrist and are you on any meds? (i have to say that when i was your age and younger i hated taking medications and i pretty much refuse to which led to a lot of horrible circumstances) next thing that i would like to ask you is if you have any support common like family members or friends? (personally i have given up telling family members about my diagnosis because they just dont understand and or they just dont care) but i am hoping you have somebody that you can confide in i have to apologize for this incredibly long message i wanted to tell you just one more thing when you talk about getting out of your house and going to stores or going out with friends or you dont to have fun i used to have one friend who would slowly take me into the stores like we would go to the parking lot and just sit there and we did that a couple of times until i felt okay and the panic attacks subsided and then we would start walking toward the door lets just say anxiety overload but we did that several times until again i was feeling okay about it and then we walked into the door and pretty much stood right inside the door once again several several times and then the next step was to walk around the store there is a name for this but i dont remember what it is i cant think of the name of this technique i know that not everything works for everybody but maybe you have someone who could do that for and with you? if you do try it like i said before im sorry that youre going through this but if you allow yourself to just have a calming of some sort and i dont like to make promises but i i really do want to say to you then i promise this will pass but you need all the help you can get talk to me anytime privately if youd like dont think that i am always so strong the majority of my days are hard as hell and sometimes okay put a smile on your face most times we need help and sometimes that help isnt right next to us sometimes it is via the internet :-) oh! another thing i wanted to say was be good to yourself we who have mental illnesses tend to do and be everything for everyone else and we forget about ourselves pamper yourself take a bubble bath or get your nails done read a good book or watch a movie anyway again i am so sorry for the long ass message and if you see errors in my message it is because i voice text (i have hand tremors from one of my medications) and a lot of times my cell phones wants to say things in another language or just say really weird words and whatnot i hope youre feeling a slight bit better okay:-) i will leave you alone for now :-),0
seroquel is going to be difficult for me i had withdrawl symptoms for a couple of months i had horrible itching and had to take benedryl to take care of it klonopin you might be moody for awhile i dont recall withdrawl symptoms off of lamictal same with prozac i dont recall because i was on that too many years ago but i remember i didnt tirate off of it im sorry you are having to face going off of your medications that just really stinks,1
i find bible passages help me prayerand knowing gods name (knowing who i am praying too) i have lived with depression most of my life  since being a small child and now in my late 50s bible passages that can help “jehovah is close to the brokenhearted; he saves those who are crushed in spirit”​—psalm 34:18 “throw your burden on jehovah and he will sustain you never will he allow the righteous one to fall”​—psalm 55:22 “i jehovah your god am grasping your right hand the one saying to you ‘do not be afraid i will help you’”​—isaiah 41:13 “never be anxious about the next day”​—matthew 6:​34 “let your petitions be made known to god; and the peace of god that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts”​—philippians 4:​6 7 ,0
exact same thing i was hospitalized twice and they put me on leave during the second hospital stay and said if i couldnt get it together in a month they would have to fire me i was too ashamed to go back to that job if i was going to be treated in that manner so i quit i couldnt find another job for over 4 months and now we are getting evicted from our apartment due to affiliated late rent payments,0
you should seek therapy before you do anything i went to therapy and learned ways to deal with anxiety and depression it helped a lot,1
substance abuse is often associated with mood disorders and i have found in my own life that addiction is a serious battle: i can become addicted to anything it seems not just the usual drugs however remember when you are fighting not to feel ashamed you are addicted you are not bad or weak or lousy and you should not be ashamed! you are amazing and remember that just because you relapsed doesnt mean you failed just keep trying to quite! thats what is important,1
a friend of mine uses that and says it helps her good luck with it  i myself am bipolar 2 and i need a mood stabilizer and something for anxiety  sometimes it takes awhile and some trial and error to find what meds work for you i wish you well ❤,1
i think she is to young to know maybe in simpler terms say mummy gets tired if u try organise things better or relax more have some time to urself each day get a good sleep go for a msssage maybe then this will help you to be calmer im still struggling with most of these try see the difference between important things to be upset about and the not so important sometimes getting upset over smaller issues isnt worth it give her 5 mins to do something if she wants even if it is bedtime my daughter same age spend quality time together obviously u know irritability is part of the illness just control what u can breathe  im sure most of ur have this issue we coping with a lot esp with kids just make a few changes to help genetics is part of it but so is living environment make everything as nice as u can get her into good habits like tidying sleeping early this will help for future occasionally shouting not gona affect so much but be aware do what u can to reduce it x,0
struggling to its been a long time,0
my personal belief is that due to the fear of the unknown  people take their own lives to feel in control,0
dont be afraid there is help,1
yes my mother denied my bipolar ptsd and anxiety for years she has finally accepted it but still questions my medications whenever i see her which is like 1 week out of the year,1
i know this sounds reeeeealllly stupid but why have i never thought to set a damn reminder/alarm on my phone!! it wouldve saved me a lot of skipped doses and aggravation! lmao! hey ya live and ya learn ,0
those people that do that are more insecure than the person they are joking about  its a defense mechanism,0
youll get fat and tired restless leg syndrome,0
the chance of passing it on to a child is big  and meds can cause horrible bith defects  i was born w 10 i am 37 and was told during my last episodes not to have them and it sounds like the the guy wouldnt be much help a child is a huge responsibility even if their born healthy  the risk of passing this on is real have you ever considered adoption? i know you want to have kids but there are so many that need good homes try and get your health squared away it isnt fair to put your wants before theres meds alone would cause them to suffer the world is hard enough you know this suffering isnt fair for anyone you can do what you want just do your homework get the help u need first  and go from there im sure you wouldnt want your child to have the same things your dealing with hang in there  your worth it hope this helps coming from a child who has this disease that was passed down to them not intentionally but we know more now research and weigh the odds,0
im sorry but the person saying "being in a relationship with a bipolar person is the last thing you need" is terrible advice as someone who is bipolar 1 and ultra rapid cycling i can tell you i am a whole new brand of crazy my husband that has spent 10 years with me and going through this battle with me would say the same my husband is not bipolar but has sever depression and anxiety himself we support each other on my good days he leans on me on my bad days i lean on him we learned about each others issues and how to help each other we did couples therapy to heal some of the wounds i caused before i was diagnosed and properly medicated never give up on someone just because they have a mental illness living with bipolar disorder or any other anxiety depression disorder us hard especially with bipolar because of the stigma you feel ashamed and unaccepted and scared for people to know because you never know how they will react from my own personal experience i was not completely open with my husband or anyone close to me until i was finally properly medicated and thinking clearly i have relationships that got stronger and i have relationships with friends that ended because they never wanted to learn what it really is like not just the movies and if you are a bipolar person out there who feels like you cant be in a relationship because of your mental illness you are wrong it is possible im not going lie and say it is easy shit at one point i was throwing things across the room at my husbands head for no reason but he understood i needed more help then i had i got the right help now i am happy healthy stable and working closely with my psychiatrist to plan starting a family living life to fullest with mental illness is possible,0
you dont have to serve in the military to have ptsd do not quit taking your meds without talking to your doctor to help fight stomach upset try taking it with food but call your dr regardless,1
cassondra pettit i wouldnt just write my story about anxiety if i didnt mean it i have suffered anxiety & depression along time  sometimes i think people dont understand how it can make the person feel  i posted on here to let people know about my anxiety and depression because its sometimes hard to find anyone who understands me and how anxiety takes over me sometimes i cant control it at all  i pray a lot that one day ill over become the anxiety its not a easy thing to deal with in life ,0
vistaril is a joke its just glorified benadryl i tried it and it did absolutely nothing for my depression or anxiety,1
i suffer with depression & anxiety that can get really bad in seconds when something or someone triggers it,1

just keep reminding her that you want to understand to be able to support her better! its tough to open up fear of being judged just keep reminding her that you love her and only want to help! she will eventually come around ~dani,0
i could have written this post my family has no concept of what bipolar is all they do is yell at me my anxiety can get so bad that i lose it and can get nasty my meds dont work ive been on countless useless medications i only see my psychiatrist about once every two to three months not good i called him yesterday to change my anxiety meds so far i havent heard back from him i will give him a couple of more hours if he doesnt call back i will call him again i will turn myself into a pain in the ass if i have to i really dont care anymore my brother committed suicide because he could not stand the pain from depression anymore thankfully i am not suicidal i just want to be given meds that actually work im afraid to go to sleep at night because i know the anxiety i will wake up with oh yeah i am raising my 13 year old grandson its very difficult im sorry for rambling thanks for listening,1
exactly why my mom gets the worst of my venting  im not mean but im tough on her  she also has bipolar personality disorder anxiety and life long addiction issues  would do anything in the world for her though  you are clearly her rock!,1
suicide is not selfish to think about or even do it the entire point of suicide is that you want to end your pan and not put those around you in pain the pain of you being around yes its part of mental illness i know i have anxiety i have depression i have bipolar and they are severe i am in treatment i am on medication and i still have the suicidal thoughts and suicidal tendencies so does my fiance so to sit there and say that anyone who doesnt seek help ithat doesnt make them selfish for all you know they could be seeking treatment so no it is not and i repeat not a selfish thing and it is very upsetting to say that it is a selfish thing and the fact that they are talking about it and theyre asking if and when it is okay that is their way of asking and of getting help so why dont you try putting yourself in someone elses shoes before you say theyre being selfish because unless you have the illnesses and you can stand and walk in that mindset a hundred percent of the time you will never understand it not fully,0
do you like animals they can really help if they get the up most trust with in you dogs and cats can tell when your upset if your in a apartment fed law prevents them from charging you or discrimination also volunteer can help,1
i struggled for about 20 years with the idea of "having to take meds for the rest of my life" so id take them for a few months and once i felt "normal" i would wean myself off them so i could be "normal" every single time within 4 or 5 months id end up in the hospital for one self harm situation or another even after that i wouldnt take the meds and would end up in a long term rehab within 3 years as a result of trying to self medicate with a barrage of different substances buy into the hype of anti medication or jump on the band wagon of anti big time pharmaceuticals but ive been taking my prescribed medication daily as prescribed by my doctor and havent been hospitalized or taken street drugs / obsessive amount of alcohol since when i tried to be "normal" by avoiding my medication i ended up acting abnormal now that im staying on my medication i live the most normal life ive ever lived before just sayn,1
worry about society? no,0
godim so glad to hear you didnt succeed in your attemptyoure going to get help & thats the best optionif you have not been down the route if institutions & counseling before try not to worry they are trained & understand i really hope you find some solace& peace of mindbe very proud of yourself for the courage & strength youve shown in reaching out for helpmy thoughts & prayers are with you be strong god bless you xxx,0
yes i do and im taking sleeping pills and anxiety meds and its not working im so frustrated,1
i was very much the same i thought i was getting better but i avoided things maintained a very very strict control on myself and when things got so overwhelming i just about lost it i got so depressed i couldnt control mood swings i realized i had no quality of life and i needed help and no was going to do that but me i keep looking till i found a dr i liked and listened to me that understood it wasnt am about the meds and let me try alternatives until i realized they really werent helping and when i was ready i started on meds its taken awhile to find some that work but im getting better having someone to talk to like a psychiatrist that again you really like and can eventually open up to really helped me having the right team and positive things to focus on even when things get bad makes a world of difference,1
never blame urself only b proud that the one gone is now at peace and suffers no more i envy the dead i am jealous that others have succeeded where i failed but they struggle or cry tears no more b proud of them i hold anyone up who succeeds as heros,0
seroquel is notorious for weight gain i had horrible side effects from effexor but it is highly individual gabapentin isnt that high i started at 600 or 800 and went up to 1200 day,0
one of the best things i ever did was pack my bags one day leave everyone everything behind and moved to honolulu hawaii to become a chef it was 6 years ago i didnt know anyone here it took me a month to find an apartment in culinary school no previous experience i used to be like 335lbs i swear i lost 100lbs the first cple months just from being a nervous wreck but im still alive and kicking i think that was the turning point for me when i decided i was in control of my life not whatever illness talk to your tutors whatever you need to do to process at some point whether its this or an event 5 years down the road you are going to be looking at similar roadblocks good luck with whatever you choose to do!,0
i suffered lots of side effects none listed here but were dangerous and scary,1
i exactly have this sometimes going outside even for 5mins helps or fun music while i do a small task like unload dishwasher also i dont set expectations for myself at these times because if i cant do them ill feel guilty in addition to what im already feeling!!!!! try tell myself that itll pass and it gets better,0
feeling vulnerable at home is a common but unhealthy response to a toxic  abusive relationship take another supportive adult ( witness ) with you loudly invite them into the house so family hears it dont whisper be bold explain that you are leaving and taking only your things explain that you have discussed this with police and can call them to the house should it be necessary explain that you refrained from reporting the "hit" and can do so now if the need arises explain the jail time if you report and press charges practice saying all this numerous times in short concise sentences then quickly grab your stuff and go no discussion have a business card for a point of contact with police i am a firefighter and have done this for others before best of luck god bless,0
i take it along with anti depression and anxiety med! im stable and with blood work 2 times a year healthy,1
took it for 2 months last year for fibro and migraines really kick started my weight loss from the weight i gained on gabapentin but it made me severely nauseous and i had major food aversions so when i dropped 12 pounds in 60 days i was taken off,1
well first you should congralate yourself that you can hold dowm a job and a highly paid one apart from allowing time for appointments giving you chance to reduce your hours or change duties even for temporary period refer you to occupational health for support ensure you dobt experience discrimination bullying etc at work not sure what else you think they should do i dont know where you are from or what sector you work in sometimes you need to step back and if that means changing jobs or taking less stressful lower paid job for your health then you zhpujd consider it i have had to except that although i have a reasonable job with a reasonable salary im never going to be able to do a more senior job due to my mh and i have really struggled to accept that and not feel and if i am a failure but i know for me thats how it is,0
probably sounds really dumb of me butare there classes where the family members can go and learn about it? so they can educate themselves a bit personally if i was the family member and had a mentally ill loved one id go to book stores libraries the internet and educate myself on my loved ones mental illness study and write things down when you truly love someone youd do anything to help them feel at ease you would love them support them listen to them and they will love you back love both ways if someone loves you they wouldnt act this way im so frustrated about them not wanting to educate themselves or find a book or something so so many dont bother thats not love i have full blown panic/anxiety attacks and take my meds to calm me down i guess im a "junkie" too a junkie is someone who is addicted or dependent on drugs or meds and cant stop sorry this has happened darling,0
meditation for me i put my earphones in and put on some loud nice music that i like no words just slow music and i to do a little mental procedure of mindfulness getting into my here and now state to me its lining up my energy because when im having a panicked attack or anxiety im all out of whack its your body trying to tell you something and getting lost thats all sometimes if its really bad excersise  controlled breathing umm if im at home a warm shower or 5 min laying down quietly,0
i have more patoentsthat work for direct tv century link and comcast i think those companies cause extreme anxiety,1
i moved to portugal and for the first year i was too scared to go out alone as i didnt speak portuguese now i can so feel much better im so sorry youre having this problem but i can relate for years i was afraid of the night because thats when our grandfather would get drunk and chaos reigned i was also afraid of teenaged boys for years due to harassment youre doing the right thing by talking about your fear i hope you will be able to share with your dr hugs,0
just keep being supportive ive battled depression (and at times been suicidal) since i was about 11 so i understand how hes feeling and honestly just knowing my parents knew was terrifying but a relief as well their support meant more to me than anything! just keep open dialogue with him dont judge and be patient on the days when he may be less receptive your suggestions and help also though keep an eye out for when he starts to withdraw for extended periods of time this will likely be when the suicidal thoughts are returning eventually he will need to see a doctor so dont force that on him if you can help it but keep it on the table as an option for when he is ready (i was in my 20s when that time finally came wish i wouldve gone sooner now) but if he starts to get worse instead of better you may have to make that choice for him just be prepared you will know if and when that time is,0
depakotes a weight gainer but theres meds to counteract that but dont be alarmed unless ur already overweight alot,1
ah it is genetic folks and a huge struggle ,0
avatar: the last airbender i was obsessed with the show growing up :( also the hills have eyes or basically any movie where an animal dies :(,1
i would say be honest with your boyfriend explain that you are uncomfortable with the diagnosis and thats why you have not told him i had similar difficulties with a female in the early years of my diagnosis she eventually found out from someone else and ended the realationship because i had not been honest if he loves you he will stay around half the battle with a mental health diagnosis is accepting there is a diagnosis i know how difficult that can be; however it can be a huge relief and you will feel much better just by accepting that there is no shame that there is something wrong and you are not the only one as others have and do suffer the same and similar i have schizo affective disorder i hope all goes well for you,0
getting off of it is horrible,0
you are definitely not alone! i have an excellent support system but have people who have a hard time accepting my diagnosis​ even though its been confirmed by 4 separate psychiatrists i also have bipolar disorder major depression generalized anxiety ocd ednos and panic disorder many people who dont have a mental illness dont understand that all of these are often symptoms of each other and are all interconnected so often people think youre either a hypocondrac or just super "crazy" i just tell people that i have bipolar disorder and really bad anxiety i also understand about feeling guilty you have to remember everyone is different and everyone has their own experiences youre allowed to feel the way you do its not of any choosing of your own ive found that holding in my emotions and feeling guilty does more good than harm i journal my emotions now and pick a person in my support system to confined in,0
definetly have 8 of these i used to be #1 when i was younger and i dont start any fights but people be bullying me and sometimes i have to defend myself verbally or physically but ive been diagnosed with bipolar type 2 since im more depressive and have major anxiety it really sucks and its hard for people to truly understand but i go day by day for my soon to be daughter and husband which im glad he is there for me physically and emotionally even though it can be difficult,0
im skeptical that ur psychiatric provider will prescribe benzos for u if u have a history of abusing substances let me share my situation i also suffer from severe anxiety i have taken xanax (alprazolam) in the past for a total of 5 years i started seeing a new psychiatrist last year he treats patients with substance abuse disorders as a result he refuses to prescribe any benzos for me however they throw an ambien prescription (10 mg) at me i may consider changing physicians,1
thats actually the total opposite of me because of my mental illness and seeing society judge othera so harshly my hygiene is like the one aspect i can control so i always brush my teeth and shower and such daily its almost to the extreme opposite although i am dealing with the same issues so i am extremely understanding of those who just cant muster the energy its just the one thing i never struggle with,0
shy nielsen,0
me too and not only recently most of my life suddenly i start thinking about death and i give myself a panic attack which makes me feel like im dying right now its awful,0
seeing as how my job is developing technology i fear this day,0
im bipolar 11 which is diagnosed major depressive episodes hypomania talking way to fast we are fidgety cant sleep for long periods at a time without feeling sleepy kinda like being on a speed drug mania causes you to act irrationally like just packing up and leaving everything behind when you finally become more rationale again you=e like what the heck did i do our thought process is way out there in left field beleive g that what we say is the gospel we are difficult to treat coming up with the right drug combination is difficult hope this helps those that dont understand the scale  ,0
i struggle to fight my way through the depression i dont want it to totally take over so i fight hard  sometimes i win sometimes the depression wins but i will never stop fighting the hardest thing is fighting alone and having no one know or understand what your going through or even care,0
i know what you mean exactly i figured out that if i learn as much as i can the better i can explain to friends/other support what i want them to knowyou probably know a lotits pretty difficult to explain it to someone tho some days im so anxious i dont know what to sayto anyonelet alone explain this!! read things articleswhatever you find helpful for yourself and maybe refer them strait to that,0
in all honesty you truly need to check in to a hospital take care of yourself and dont worry about your family yelling at you you can tell someone at the hospital how youre treated by your family it may be considered abuse for the way they treat you also you might want to look into disability for your illness,0
happens in a manic state and is part of the instant gratification mood for some this can be harmful and they may become abusive in behavior but dont worry most are just over active at times- thats my take,1
i have been close back in may in fact due to my sisters arguing while my father was battling cancer i even wound up in the psych ward for a week i like to call it "the looney tunes bin" since then my father has passed away due to this terrible disease i havent been as close though even though my sisters are still fighting and have decided to put me in the middle i hate playing "dawn in the middle" one thing that anyone struggling with these tempting thoughts should keep in mind is the definition of suicide its really just a permanent solution to a temporary problem lately when i get these types of thoughts these steps help 1) stuffed animal 2) crawl under a warm blanket 3) cry,0
even if u need to take 2 days off work- mental illness is as serious as physical illness if youre feeling unwell thats a sick day too and u dont need to be specific about why u call in sick if u dont rest and your anxiety spirals way out of control u may end up hospitalized and or missing a lot more work,1
well im screwed! explains the memory and control part! glen lol im such a little stress head ,0
amen to that i have bipolar pstd ocd anxiety panic my brain is full :(,1
ive been feeling like this on n off for years but the last few months its gotten worse and im struggling to cope with all my thoughts worries and emotions x,0
be careful duramine is speed and can increase possibility of mania my psych wont put me on it because of that fact its too risky it shouldnt be used as a psych drug its purely approved for weight loss and not any psych illness id really speak to your psych about it,0
julie and everybody in general: "chemical" or "natural" it doesnt fucking matter - max has a point many of us would be dead or non-functioning or leading much more miserable lives without that "little pill most people swallow" it doesnt matter that those pills have been "refined by man" - much of our food our healthy food is refined as well a lot of stuff has had something done to it that doesnt make it bad or unhealthy or "unnatural" so i suggest: 1 doing what works for you as an individual 2 shutting the fuck up trying to advise others how to deal with their mental illnesses,0
im sure this is helpful and interesting but my anxiety cant take it! oh the irony!,1
i have suffered on and off with depression and anxiety for 30 years sometimes theyre bad and sometimes theyre tolerable just tell yourself its only an anxiety attack and youre not having a heart attack and you will be fine do some deep breathing and think happy thoughts if you ever need to talk im here,0
effexor can be a godsend for some people but when mixed with other medsor even by itself it can carries a high risk for causing suicidal thoughts please talk to your doc hospitals have programs that help pay for what your insdoesnt i used to work in the dept that does that just once you are past the crisis ask to speak to someone in either case management or social work and explain your financial situation and ask them to help you apply for whatever resources you need to cover the remainder of your bills and they will direct you to the right formsetcand if you need help you fill them out i hope this helps finances should never prevent someone from getting the care they need when they have a crisis my best wishes to you,1
shon kennett that you for sharing your heart a true warrior in the mist of your suffering thats what you actually are the movement needs people like youits awesome i did try many years ago to kill myself and then 4 years ago i wanted to gas my self thank the lord jesus i didnt see i saw that bi polar isnt like living in a cave (the light only stays in the cave) but more its like a tunnel because there is always light at the end of the tunnelim going through a very stressful time but yet i see hope think its my faith that helps me to tell you the truth crazy thing is when im manic i called my self "the white princess of africa" i know it sounds crazy but in my bi polar mind this princess has a story to tell about her faith and she calls it africa because i live here and that is who i preach to when im in mania i always preach to african people here because just like me they struggle in povertyso i see where that pain is coming from because even thou my pain is different its the same i had therapy and the white princess is gone but it was a crazy fun scary time in my life thank god,0
meds are individual i ha shakes really bad phycotic visions,0

oh wow i was on 400mgs of seroquel when i fell pregnant dropped it cold turkey cause i was so worried about what it would do to bub ive got a healthy almost 10 month old now and the depression and getting back stable has been hard but im coming good,0
i was told to give myself a shake before being diagnosed with bipolar!,1
1st on list  you feel like u cant breathe she isnt dead! inhale again yup still does ur head in  so ur anxiety is totally real as u smile and pretend get a hot water bottle turn ur saddest music on and validate yourself coz you matter  give yourself permission to feel that shit coz its the secret to your healing !!,0
unfortunately i have not heard much positives about veteran hospitals and doctors im sorry youre going through so much im sure its overwhelming for you and the family escalate escalate and escalate for a refill and/or an explanation of the prescribed dosage be clear and let them know they made a "mistake"! ask for a director who the dr reports to and update the dr of your actions they usually hear " mistake" and respond your husband should not have to suffer through this also he might want to contact he general practitioner to inform of situation i wish you luck and a quick resolution ive been in the same situation,0
my last episode had mixed psychotic features which really scared me,0
did you recieve medical attention? are you safe? is there someone safe that you can be with? i am so sorry to hear how much your struggling and what your going through <3 we are here for you please stay safe <3,0
im scared to try new meds,1
daily alarm set on my phone,0
i am so sorry for your loss i lost my mother april 15 of 2009 it sent me into a tailspin after the reality set in i was manic for over a year from that i suggest taking action now before anything gets worse be proactive 100% the outcome is never good from a manic episode and add the anxiety on top of that its just horrible my love goes out to you and i hope you find peace ❤️,0
ca n relate big time panic station everyone get to your panic stations ,0
it just now makes me more guilty to ask for help ,1
lonely serenity peace turmoil,0
im sorry to hear of your husbands condition any med change can be scary i also take gabapentin 300 mg 3 times per day when needed for anxiety if you live in a medical state why not consider mmj it could be a quick alternative until he can be seen by a doctor they are using it for ptsd just my 2 cents,1
as a person who fights suicidal ideations every day and as a person whos attempted suicide quite a number of times throughout my life this post was in a very strange way reassuring you get tired of hearing how other people will feel nobody seems to care how you feel no one understands the deep hole of despair thats suicidal person is in no one understands the bone-chilling pain that a suicidal person is always in and how every day is a struggle not to try to kill yourself,0
make sure to ask about side effects a lot of medications for mental illness cause weight gain some even cause depression and anxiety manic episodes and suicidal thoughts so no these dont happen to everyone but its good to know what may possibly happen a really bad one for weight gain is seroquel although it does help with sleep and moods apparently for many and something that i have come across and it was something really horrible called akathesia and i hope im explaining this correctly not even sure i spelled it correctly but it is a nerve disorder really the only way i can explain it is that it looks like youre having a seizure your arms and legs move involuntarily its a horrible horrible side effect of latuda which made me sad because latuda really worked well for my bipolar depression but like i said not everyone gets the side effects,1
im lazy so i just turn my pill bottles over like an hourglass right after i take them sunday is my start day so on monday they are upside down tuesday they are right side up and so on then if im unsure if ive taken my meds i just count back to sunday and i know whether the bottle should be right side up or upside down and then i know if i took my pills,1

god forbid he has kids with a woman who will suffer from post pardom depression and any woman who has kids and becomes a mom is never "solid"  he lives in a dream world of ignorance and tv land thinking of stable solidity when kids enter the picture it puts more strain on the marriage and everyone life if you dont learn to work together and pick up slack for one another one is weak so the other will be strong and you will switch roles every now and then,0
you are not alone many people suffer from anxiety and depression we feel the same way see a doctor and let them prescribe you meds to take youll feel better,1
ive been on lithium for over 20 years and it has made a world of difference i wont change it im also on paxil to help with depression i still have my moods but bit as bad as when i was unmedicated also take adivan for stress and nerves helps with anxiety and panic attacks,1
call someone hopefully you were given crisis team numbers or visit a&e x you are in an acute phase & need to use your energy to dial for assistance x i was there 10 years ago with a manic phase of bipolar x the restless legs may be a depakote side effect but continue to take it until youve had proper advice x reach out xx,1
i used to self harm when i worked in a toxic atmosphere ever since i got away from that terrible job i quit cutting maybe you should look for a better job that isnt stressful and definitely without a jerk of a boss you deserve better than that you are worth it also counseling can help and a lot of them are on a sliding pay scale so not real expensive get the help you need! you are worth it!,1
im on seroquel and it helps me a lot i sleep on it and it helps with anxiety i was offered it like you 5 years ago and was certain i would not take it but then ended up with phychosis severe i was sectioned and it had helped me become well then it was lowered nearly 2 years ago aniexty got so high i had a manic episode so on it at higher doses now and diagnosed with bipolar  if i took it earlier at the lower doses i would have avoided getting so ill and would be on lower doses but i was then anti medication but now it has been a life saver im also on two others now lithium and venaflaxin  good luck ,1
it could be a hormone imbalance but it could just as easily be that the frustration has been building up and its reaching its peak mental illness aside you are only human and its natural to get frustrated when things are stressful i dont think its unreasonable to speak out when all you needed in the first place das a straight answer make sure you unwind outside of work and visit your doctor for some blood tests to check your levels ~vw~,1
constant struggle for me unfortunately ive become torn between having multiple partners (obviously a relationship burner) and using porn and strip clubs and the like to enhance self-pleasurefor which ive received much ridicule not a great "answer"more of an "i feel your pain daily",0
funny- "bad moms scary- "dont breathe",1
no you arent alone how about scheduling a lay around do nothing day? once it even twice a week rest take a break from the endless self battles and let the dishes sit no tidying up not even getting dressed on other days when you just hate everything tell yourself "i will take care of stuff today because thursday i can blow it all off no guilt" we gotta learn how to actually rest rather than crumple under the pressure we put on ourselves,0
such simple words - doubt theyll ever help me ,1
i take doxepin at night along with prozason i am bipolar with high anxiety ptsd i do ok pray you find peace,1
yes unless you suffer from depression and anxiety issues you will never understand how hard it is to live day by day and keep going like everything is normal,0
i wonder if youre on the right meds mood stabilizers are good for controlling anxiety and depression like lithium and zonisamide and a benzo and a hobby suicide is no way out its the absolute end its giving up and im sure you havent tried everything!,1
i think she wants to know shes not alone and that someone cares maybe get some advice from others in similar high stress situations about how to deal everything shes going through ,0

not anxiety but i cannot sleep more than 45 minutes without a pill otherwise my body treats it as a power nap,1
dang in the us they dont give disability to recently diagnosed mental illness you have to show a long history of it disrupting your life after diagnosed with that being said i have generalized anxiety disorder ibs adhd and depression it takes a while to get the right combination of medication to work if the anxiety becomes controlled them the ibs becomes controlled with fewer ibs episodes which also can be controlled by treating the symptoms working helps a lot with anxiety so dont give up on ithope you feel better soon,1
set an alarm on your phone or put it by your car keys,1
i had gambling problems i was always buying scratchers but i had really bad muscle tremors my left arm shook constantly and it was starting to effect my right arm it too was getting to the point of being more so then not and as an artist losing the ability to draw and write is my biggest fear and that medicine was getting in the way if that so i just quite taking everything and only smoked weed now im the happiest ive ever been in life,0
just because there was one person having a crisis does not mean that you cant go back there!! it will happen again and it could be you the next time you need to trust the doctors and go back!! welbutrin is ok but if it is sending you into mania that is not ok a hospital stay can regulate your meds to give you some stability believe me i have been there during my last stay there was one woman who was not stable and she was all over the place i just avoided her when it got really bad the staff let us watch a movie in another room so please dont let this get in the way of your health and well-being!,0
im sorry this is so long but i just posted this yesterday as a wake up call to my husband  i have a rantfor those of you who have a friend or loved one with a mental illness/chemical imbalance let me share with you some thoughts 1 we have real genuine emotionshowever more often than not those emotions are overshadowed and pushed aside when the focus turns to the outburst we may have causedwhile trying to express our emotions 2 the most hurtful belittling thing u can say to someone with depression/bipolar or any other chemical imbalance disorderis" your not really mad/hurt/etcyour just crazy youll be fine in a few days youll get over it" (most of us are well aware we let our crazy show way too muchwe really dont need you to remind us) now that being saidis it fair to youthat you deal with these outbursts and mixed emotions from your friend or loved onenoits noti have no doubt that its hardand painful i have personally put my own family and friends thru hell and back and i would take it all back if i couldi would fix it every wrong or bad impulsive decision ive ever made just to give them some peace every day people like me struggle over every​ single decision we makesecond guessing if we are doing right thing or "just being crazy" (once againwe are awaredont remind us) on good dayswe are even able to evaluate the words that come out of our mouths or what is expressed on fb the point iswe do have real feelingsreal emotionswe get our feelings hurtwe get angryeven when we are fully medicatedby not validating thatall your doing is pushing us awaymaking us doubt ourselves morein my world personallyi cant handle much more of thatmy mind already runs 24/7 just trying to maintain a certain level of normalcy,0
i have disabling bipolar ii and these comments really show how differently medications work for different people they tried to give me latuda for my attituda and i had a horrible reaction i wandered from room to room not knowing what to do unable to think logically the only thoughts that were going through my head was if this is life i dont want to live it im very very resistant to try new medications because of latuda theyre trying to talk me into lemactil now,0
im sorry thats not true and whats more the bible doesnt teach that and it wont back you god is merciful and kind and the book of proverbs speaks repeatedly of his understanding the bible shows many who suffered from different illnesses and sense then many more plague people furthermore the letters to the congregations and the apostles in the greek scriptures share more detail of how we should console the depressed dont use the bible to crush the helpless i live in a family plagued by this illness and trust me if it was all in the head fearing god wouldve cured it a century ago you should stop talking and you are still quite ignorant,0
tony dennis i have been living with bipolar 1 for more than 30 years it took years to get my meds right but i feel all emotions joy happiness sadness anger fear etc please talk to your doctor only feeling sadness is not normal,1
im bipolar with anxiety and depression message me if ya wanf,1
everyone is different they put me on a combination of medications to help with my depression anxiety and add they work well but they may not work well for you does your doctor do blood work to check the levels of the medication in your system?? or maybe try genetic tests that look for certain genes that resist meds??,1
sometimes they do this! upsetting,0
perhaps celexa and a hormone replacement would help just a suggestion but it has helped too often women have major hormone issues that contribute to depression anxiety and insomnia just a suggestion,1
my weight goes up and down significantly it is horrible but i feel better because i am stabilized and that is essential to live,0
ive been diagnosed bipolar 1 ptsd from domestic violence childhood also year ago march 8 three days after my 39th birthday my mother almost killed me with her honda crv in the garage shes diabetic she cant feel her feet very well so that cause ptsd flashes and so on i also know i have the neurosis which is the medical term for being neurotic i have shaking leg syndrome ocd for my hands being clean and i cross cut but i use hot water which i started doing in 2013 i found out at the age 39 last august that im bipolar im on escitalopram/lexapro antidepressant 20mg a day and for the mood stabilizer im on divalproex extended release 2000mg a day im having some dangerous driving problems eversense the garage accident i am driving a hundred miles an hour past an illinois state trooper what else every time someone purposely gets into slow me down ill just go i dont care or they ride my ass at 75 80 miles an hour that will trigger me and ill just take off going to commit suicide last year they gave me a hotline to call i did now i have insurance and i have help hopefully things will be better in a year sometimes i feel like im having a mini-stroke im just sitting there looking at picking up my controller play a video game but that i just stare at it and do nothing i was like my brain is just getting fried or freezes up or something everything thats going on right now with the law emotions my body i think its just easier its better just to say goodbye go take care of some things and then and then to go even though i know thats the depression talking it would solve the issue because well theres no cure for what i have thats a bunch of my impeccable long-term memory my short-term memory is terrible but i can remember my whole life just about and im not talking about special moments talking about most every day every week every month and every year of my life sometimes i think that im in hell and thats why all this shit this happening to me or that maybe were in a computer see the world in this is a prison and we are all pieces of shit sent here to suffer because we were bad either way life sucks life sucks!!!!,0
im sorry for everyone that is suffering or suffered and beat it its horrible somedays for sure but youre not alone ive been problematic since around 22 yrs old i often think about killing myself somedays i think about how hard it would be on certain people then other days (the ones that are really scary mentally) are the days when i think it would be so easy right now like it wouldnt bother me at all almost like i want to mess with death it sounds really stupid but im trying to be honest i admire all of the tattoos love to you all,0
failed? at what? you will never not have bipolar/depression it what you are struggling with so if you thought you could make it go away then yes you failed to accomplish the impossible its not about never feeling depression or mania and never struggling -- its about managing your inner state so you can live well so lets see -- you have several times come out if depression that can kill people stuck with your crisis team a long time when you needed them are raising a special needs child recognized what was happening did something about it and damn girl!! you are not failing at any single thing even a little! you are discouraged and maybe intimitated but you are not a failure,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a decade ago and i used to self medicate until it almost killed me now im taking a more holistic approach meditation has helped me immensely and is proven to lower stress levels and a ton of other benefits thats the only thing i can recommend but i too sleep a lot and find it extremely hard to leave the house but the rage has definitely decreased a lot and i know its bc of the meditation i do i need to be more adamant about making it a daily practice instead of waiting til im way far off kilter and have to meditate my way back to sanity but it does help to some degree i just dont know if i can do the whole lab rat thing anymore ive been on probably 40 + different meds over the years sometimes 6-8 prescriptions at a timeand meditation has helped me more than any of them i can only speak from my own experience but i think everyone can benefit from meditation and its worth looking into you might be surprised by what exactly meditation isas well as what it isnt best wishes <3,1
they straight up denied me three times now and i was diagnosed with complex ptsd general anxiety disorder bipolar anger issues  havent been able to get a good job in years i work now for minimum wage and get if im lucky 12 to 20 every two weeks i have to float bills just to keep the services on plan on reapplying again but i wont get it even though i fall well within the guidlines their own doctor told them i needed it,1
when i was tapering from it i got super restlesslike unable to sit down i cried a loti was very emotional it wasnt fun,1
with my husband he said that he doesnt know how to talk to me anymore weve been together for 9 years ive been dealing with this for almost 20 years he said he doesnt know if he can talk to me normally or if he has to treat me like a baby because hes afraid of saying the wrong things and upsetting me,0
omg so true my ex would say things about my anxiety & depression & would put me in horrible positions around his friends he used to get drunk be sarcastic & upset me wen i got upset he would blame me cos we had a disagreement didnt help he was a narsasist,0
medication is only part of the solution i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder i would strongly suggest seeing a psychologist/therapist while you are waiting do some research on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness they have been a godsend therapy along with the right meds mean i can hold down a good full time job now i have my bad days and i tend to collapse on the weekend it i still feel i have a purpose medication can be a lot of trial and error it took me 18 mths to get the right combo also be careful of xanax you can either grow dependant on it or you can just get used to it so you need more to give you adequate relief chat to your dr about your meds and therapy it can and does get better it just takes time,1
propranolol / seraquel / lamictal it lowered my blood pressure,0
no you are not alone if my meds are not properly regulated i have blinding rage outbursts i am cranky & bitchy everything gets on my nerves i yell like a banshee it is horrible you have to stay on top of the meds,1
i had sugar cravings for about 5 days on that dose and now my appetite is back down i wouldnt worry about weight gain if it helps to balance you out if tried literally everything and saved what i thought was the worst seroquel for last,0
medication treats the symptoms not the cause yoga meditation really works and i unexpectedly found help in my new misfit watch that tells me what activities i have done including swimming and the sleep pattern i have it helps to see what ive actually done and has made me more relaxed around sleep its as if i am waiting to find out what it was rather than stressing on it at the time daft but it has helped,1
there was one person in the whole world my friend trusted he mocked her called her unmentionable names called her stupid you name it i had to talk to her for three hours to convince her not to leave this world so please anxiety and bipolar is no joke they didnt ask to be born with it,0
i have the same problem its hard i had an episode in feb where i didnt sleep for 11 days i was not medicated bc i lost days in my mind i ended up being so paranoid that i went crazy on my loved ones had a break between fantasy and reality i went off on his mom and my entire family  now he seems embarrassed to b w me she wont forgive me and everyone thinks we should break upi have multiple diagnosis but he has a hard time understanding them we have been together 8 yrs he drank a lot but now is sober i want to marry him but im not sure im ready to explain my illness to everyone who already have me labeled as crazy  i have said sorry and that it wont happen again i knoe my triggers and symptoms and have a lot of support and have help to get through the bad days  dont know if its to broken or worth saving  life is hard enough and i cant beg anymore for forgiveness,0
it can also be anxiety a lot of people with anxiety wont be able to make eye contact i used to do it when mine was really bad always kept my eyes on the floor or on things around me for some reason it freaked me out to look people in the eye,1
i have ptsd but im also a clinical therapist i would advise to see your doctor and ask for an anxiety medication in addition to the antidepressants antidepressants dont help for panic attacks and if your out of the months supply already you might be trying to self medicate with the wrong meds taking more than the prescribed antidepressants can give you side effects like suicidal thoughts i would even advocate you smoking a marijuana joint it has instant calming effects call your doctor,1
do you have a loved one a significant other i just started therapy and that seems to be helping me although the last couple days been horrible for me as well just mustering the energy to get up out of bed sometimes as ugh i do it because i have 3 kids that i love dearly and a fiance that i adore you can trust me when i say almost everybody has thought about ending their battle once in their life which is very saddening because life goes so fast and theres so much amazing things in it to experience if we allow ourselves im here if you want to talk,0
the only medicine i could take when i was pregnant was latuda and buspar neither did me any good i started before i was stayed on during miscarried my child still stayed on them and ended up in the hospital to be put on other meds i have bipolar anxiety ptsd and ocd and adhd tendencies by whatever tests that they put me through im not on generic topimax cymbalta trazidone and have to go to talk therapy every week and meet with psychiatrist every 4 weeks so??? depends on each persons individual chemistry to be honest and if you have any other health conditions as well,1
my anxiety is so bad i do isolate myself,1
i doits a struggle but focus on positivity and remove the triggers that set you off hope that helps,1
i hate taking meds the flip flop of bipolar disorder is horrible ive gotten better with handling it but sometimes it still gets me,1
good for depression hard to come off of side of effects of stopping are horrible,0
anxiety squad assemble! i swear some days i dont get out of bed unless i literally have to (food coffee toilet etc) and one thing going wrong can break my happy mood like a pin on a balloon,0
anxiety and depression is a killer,1
i am the same way  im not confused tho its what my bipolar/ anxiety issues do to me i do ask myself did i take my meds when did i last sleep hope you are on meds and they are working for you if not go see a doctor or psychiatrist and get on a regiment thats trail and error but you can do it be kind to yourself and mindful of your patterns mentally awareness of your mental state truly helps i tell myself stop and listen breathe and smile  keep on keeping on were always here,1
i am bipolar 2 and i stopped my meds when pregnant i was happier while pregnant and no mood swings my psych said no meds were safe while pregnant i know they say some are but its risk versus benefit my psych said after my baby was born my moods were out of control that was the hardest part but meds helped and with time my body went back to normal,0
loyalty doesnt mean you have to cut yourself off from half the human race thats just unhealthy my best friend is a girl i could never stop talking to her because im dating someone who is insecure,0
gabapentin has a withdrawal syndrome associated with it though it is denied by the medical community people are sufferings alone without the support of their medical providers all the time the symptoms we suffer are only recognized to happen if they are abusing their medicine i am here to tell you that people taking their medication as directed are suffering horrible withdrawals the clinical trials headed by dr scott rueben for gabapentin/lyrica and 21 pain meds in total was proven in a court of law falsified data and he was sent to prison however his data is still what the fda and the medical community uses as a trusted source suicidal idealization  extreme anxiety akathisia seizures and more your not going crazy you are indeed suffering withdrawals ,0
if you feel there is more to it beg them for help dont leave their office until they help you you cant be expected to live like this your wife needs to get involved more in understanding your illnesses i know you feel like shes giving up on you but probably just doesnt understand maybe get some books from the library or if you dont want to go there yourself maybe buy some online maybe if she reads the effects and symptoms of these illnesses might help her help you may not realise this but knowing you have an illness and feeling like there isnt something quite right going on with you is a massive step in the right direction just keep holding on it must be so scary to feel this way and not know how youll be from one hour to the next ive witnessed similar things as you when i was growing up and been beaten by my step dad and sexually abused that all fucks you up i understand where youre at im sorry for all that has happened to you and i wish you all the best mate,0
sometimes iwake up twitching / shaking from anxiety its very difficult because work a full time job,1
when an episode hits me i get down on the fact i have to take pills to be "almost" normal but i am grateful that i can pick through my thoughts 80% of the time and when i cant its bad so i am grateful for my meds im also ptsd bipolar 1 and anxiety i dont miss the nightmares and terrors so i tell myself if i was asthmatic i wouldnt be ashamed to have my inhaler so why do i need to be ashamed of meds that help my brain disease? another way to look at it,1
im looking for some science to back up the idea that it does and im struggling to find any from a reputable source do you have any?,0
most importantly i was struggling and i needed to say that past that what will be will be,0
i have 4 billion alarms set on my phone!!!,0
i have trouble understanding this (no disrespect) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial if someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesnt want to cos its medication you would be cross at them their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesnt make the insulin the same goes for depression just a different organ my brain doesnt make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesnt make insulin to get them throu i even tried on meds that were to low and i just couldnt keep my head above water but now im settled on the meds that are working for me i have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles dont get me wrong things arent all peachy and good i still have struggles but im much better at managing those times the other thing i learnt was people wait to look to get help people wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks i have someone close i spoke to saying if u notice im not good u need to tell me those close know something isnt good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help,0
just to let you know that you can message me anytimeyour not alone on this pageand im so sorry to hear about you cancer but so glad your getting betterim bipolar also and have just over the last 9 months been diagnosedand yeah your right everything screams and nobody just doesnt seem to notice at time and i live in a family of 5 my partner and 3 childrenand its not nice for me when they just tell me to shut up and take my medicationits one of the worse things they can say cos at that moment my mind then starts telling me well they must be against me and it can spiral out of controlits a terrifying thing so i can imagine your pain when you dont have anyone to turn tooall i can say is please try and be strong and keep going and remember through every dark night there is a brighter dayalso just pm i really dont mindkeep your head up xxxx,0
ive talked about this before it is all about your history and what you can show them you must have clear documentation i went with a very good and kind lawyer who reviewed my case and helped me every step of the way you must fill out your initial application on line and answer the questions in a specific way or you will be rejected automatically then you must have documentation from every doctor and hospital that has ever treated you as well as those therapists you have seen then you will also have to fill out a questionnaire about yourself that you must be very honest and open about it is brutal then a family member or spouse must also answer concerns mine was my sisters and nearly broke me to read it but it was the truth so basically you must have all your ducks in a row i am coming up on my 7 year review in 2019 i dont even know if i will still have benefits but i do know that i need to start getting prepared now and it scares the shit out of me! some of you think it would be better to "stick it out" and not be at home but my former employer did not understand my frequent need to be away from work and really they need you there and count on you as well as your fellow workers to be there it is not a commitment that i can give a company that i will be able to work full or even part time because i dont know when my symptoms will smack me down or when a manic or depressive cycle begins because mine come in rapid cycles it is terrifying for me when i dont recognize it happening to stop the process and what will happen if an employer sees this?? i had a horrible experience in my last job where my supervisor was afraid of me and refused to meet alone with me!?! all because of her misconceptions of bpd! so think long and hard before you begin the process of applying for ssdi it is not as easy as you think,0
i have seen therapist psychiatrist psychologist s all manner of counseling md  been in six mental facility s taken lists of meds so long i cant begin to list them got so sick and damn tired of repeating and repeating my life story to strangers i just quit the day my twenty three year old beautiful daughter died after a hospital stay of only four days  its like my head just went numb and my eyes got tunneled and i could hold only one thought shes gone and she left behind a 2 year old a 3 year old and a 5 year old i walked threw a week of going over my journals that i have written since i was old enough to know my alfabet and decided right thenfuck the professional head squeezers nothing up to that point was ever going to chemically balance my brain not even electro shock treatments could erase my history because they tried i had 51 years of hell that brought me to the most hellish day of my life losing my daughter everyone who knew me thought i would kill myself not once in all my abused life did it ever occur to me to ever take my own life it didnt occur to me then and still doesnt today i am 56 and a half years old in all the horrifying days since my birth from every page of every journal i ever wrote their was palpable anger as my only emotion i take the drug rispedol to control my anger i have taken it for at least 28 years maybe 30 i get 10 of the lowest does xanex they make and sometimes i might have to take them all in a month sometimes only one or two if i blow out a panic attack and i get sixty 75 norco pain pills a month for sever reahmatoid arthritis in the cold set nasty months i use them all every month and still cry all night from pain but the moral to this shitty life is this the day my beautiful daughter died in a mental hospital thru their carelessness because they " accidentally " overdosed her on her fourth dayat that moment in time i was on 13 pills three times a day for every freaking mental condition all these idiot docs could come up with when all i really needed was control i do not by any means reccommed you stop seeing your so called mental health provider but i beg you look at your own life go back to your earliest memory write yourself an honest account of your life if you like me have kept journals go back highlight the events that caused you pain made you mad or gave you emmence grief ask yourself for every event you highlight what was going threw your mind at that moment mental and physical pain most of all dont just write down the pain you felt at any given momentwrite down what you wanted to do at that moment the seconds minutes hours day weeks months years of your torment were you suicideal or homicidal did you want to disapper what were you feeling at that moment you wanted to live for sure you wanted to live or you would not have then highlight after that threat of life and death was over what did you want to do after the event that you just survived and you deal with that issue cause let me tell you knowyou cant forget fuck forgiveness thats not possible no matter what they tell you because you cant forget fuck labels they just give it all a new name for every drug they give you there is no closure because there is no door that can be closed thats going to make you forget deal only with what keeps you from living and understand this one freaking rule of life we are born we survive until we die nobody gives a shit what our real sufferings are because they feel we dont care about theirs labels mean shit not shit! and folks writing scripts care less than anyone cause they have heard it all to the point they feel nothing but the money they get paid to pretend an interest in you theres the truth right there,0
omg im fighting tears right now! its been a stressful emotional week for me!,0
always try to talk things through samaritans etc self harm can be a release from stresses or worries its like a release everyone will have different triggers and different ways of helping often its about finding something else to stop the thoughts and feelings exercise walking reading a book try speaking to your doctor and get some help and advice you have been so brave to know you need help and seek it,1
at times i live in co and have been recently trying different strains of pot for depression and anxiety,1

its hard to think "future" when youre in a dark place almost impossible ive been there many times!!! call your doctor immediately and see if you can get in asap do you have a support system? if so use them and let them know where youre at mentally i have very little support but the few i have i turn to unfortunately if their not in your shoes they dont completely understand the impact our negative self-talk has on our ability to cope the little challenges are huge to tackle when youre depressed youre going through some pretty "life changing" problems which only quadruples the situation! ive been there and no amount of "positive" thinking can bring you out of this from my experience get help even if its calling a suicide hotline! youre at the beginning of this roller coaster ride and it will and does get better it takes time and education about our disorder i have two children and have seriously attempted suicide three times i panic at thought if i had succeeded where and what damage i could have caused to my children i also went through some major issues during my "dark place" death divorce and a custody battle i ended up in the hospital where my battle and journey with depression/bipolar began its a positive thing that you were even able to reach out to this group in the past i couldnt and didnt please please help yourself and get help now! your in control of how youre story endsget help its out there trust me!,0

i also felt anxious every day going to work then i started to look at the whole picture i really looked at the things that led up to my anxiety during my first two years attendance was terrible and last year i was hospitalized for having a full blown breakdown i came to realize my job was not worth the stress or my mental health i just looked for another job with different advantages this may just not be the job for you right at this moment in time but let a dr or therapist know how you feel it may help getting on an anxiety med,1

i was on ambien for months and i was like a zombie i was tired all day i just pass out i passed out twice while driving and wrecked once its horrible id be talking on the phone and boom id be asleep in a split second mid sentence it was a nightmare i take trazadone now works pretty good for me,0
i was diagnosed at 14 i am now 33 schizo affective bi polar with anxiety ocd and agoraphobia its tough but he sounds like a true fighter i have never been able to hold a job and my ability to go out comes and goes but i fight im a mom and a gf and a daughter and a sister and now an aunt too and those things make me fight harder he will get to where he suppose to be and will work out hugs for support and any questions or someone to chat too you or your son just inbox me hope this helps,0
ok yes i get this but i have one point to make and please dont get too mad at me for this sometimes giving up on someone even someone with a serious mental health issue that is in no way their fault it the right thing to do not because the person isnt worth the time or effort to support and help them in any and every way you can but because being with that person whether being their friend or significant other is physically or mentally damaging for you i knew someone who had some serious issues that were in no way his fault + i wanted to help him and did everything i could to try and help him but being with him was seriously damaging for me my mental health is in no way as bad as his but i still have issues with anxiety and depression and being in that relationship messed me up more than i could cope with so i ended up giving up because it was the only way out i could see where i didnt end up killing myself (something id been close to at times because of this persons actions) tldr im not saying you shouldnt do anything you can to support people with mental health issues and be there for them to help them but if it is physically or mentally damaging for you then you shouldnt sacrifice your own health for someone elses no matter how much you want to help them,0
it really depends on who you have helping you if you have recorded history of issues and a good knowledgeable case worker it will be much easier i havent gone on disability they offered to send it through for me but i didnt want to but i used to work for a company that handled cases for people on unemployment going through disability working with vocational rehab consultants and it really is surprising what gets denied and what gets approved (that is why i stressed the case worker),1
kay honey you are not alone i know how impossible it is when you try to function like a normal person but your body just physically cant and you feel like shit physically which makes you more depressed which makes the pain worse and its this whole maddening cycle of seemingly endless defeat i know i am right here in this darkness with you when you have to battle your mind and body just to achieve the simplest tasks things other people would never even think twice about but you are still valid theres still hope bc theres shit that can be done to make it better to make it manageable just one step at a time one obstacle at a time one diagnosis/treatment plan at a time being admitted is a great first step in achieving that esp if you feel like you may harm yourself you can be in a safe place  and assess all of your issues with a team of professionals to comeup with a comprehensive plan to treat body and mind and if they dont have the proper specialist in hand im sure someone there would be able to refer you to someone or point you in the right direction and i know it seems scary but a 72hr hold really isnt that bad its actually really helpful and staying longer can ensure youre regulated properly on all the right meds and the drs can make sure no side effects and everything is good and usually theres a social worker who can talk to you about your living arrangements and if they are okay/safe work/disability support groups and even bridging the gap with your family ive been through this particular wringer a few times and you really do come out better in the end its like creating a new solid foundation to build a new better life and you on with the proper support in place bc youre not alone and you dont ever have to be theres a whole swarm of people waiting to help you at your local hospital love and were all here  im here we gotchu please i urge you to consider going in immediately and self admitting if youre having suicidal ideations even if youre not having those thoughts at the moment  its still a good idea to go in just bc you can have a sense of peace around you be still for a few days to regroup you can address all of your issues both mental and physical with the drs get meds sorted out and just stabilize its such a good place to regroup for moving forward anyway sorry for babbling on i just hope youre okay honey  i want you to okay and safe and well you can msg me if you want ,0
its hard for some people in general to understand those of us suffering from bipolar even when i was committed there where still people in my family who just didnt except the fact i was suffering from a disorder and believed my condition did not exist to them its all in my head and im in a mood or seeking attention ive learned to accept that they are just not ever going to accept the fact that bipolar disorder is something many of us suffer from all i can say i deal with each day as best as i can critics and all because i have a hard enough time just trying to get through the day let alone worry about what people in my family think i truly wish i could have been more use take care,0
you must be brave and do what it necessary perhaps some medication is wise during this difficult time take note of the side effects of different medications things will get easier just takes a bit of time rest when u can look after ur sons dont stress too much if poss or take too much extra on do what u need to look after children and esp urself x,1
you make a very good point it has actually been concerning me for quite some time i usually recommend chatting to their dr different meds c work differently with different people and can cause different side effects i have bipolar i and anxiety and it took me 18 mths this time around to find the right combo but im doing well and working a full time job i also have chronic pain which effects my mental health but a tweek in my doses and im doing well,1
yeah my mom was a nurse and my dad was a very liked very well-known high school football coach and since i was the furthest thing from a stereotypical coachs daughter (a straight-a student member of the student council etc) i was basically the family embarrassment my parents cared a lot about appearances and what other people thought so heaven forbid if i ever opened my mouth mine was rarely a popular opinion for example: a girl was killed in a car accident at my high school jr year she was just one of many students who had died in less than a decade at that school student council (her friends) discussed the possibility of building a memorial for her on the school grounds i was the only person who stood up and said that if they built a memorial for her theyd have to build one for every student who had died at that school that it wasnt fair to commemorate the popular girl and just forget all the others like they didnt matter boy did i hear it when my dad got home that afternoon he storms in the house puts his finger in my face and tells me "her friends can build a memorial for her if they want to and you better damn well keep your mouth shut about it" i never understood that and i dont think i ever will if my daughter stood on her own and risked being hated by everyone she knew doing what she believed is right id burst into flames id be so proud,0
i take requip for my restless legs have been taking it for 8 years magnesium has also been proven to work in some cases,1
see this is exactly what id love to be able to do but my husband hates tattoos! i did go ahead & get one (by my brother) on my foot/ankle/just above ankle area once though without saying anything there are so many great ideas i have thought of but i doubt ill ever be able to do it as theyre grand ideas!,0
ativan is a dangerous medication if you are prone to addiction at all or not it is very addicting i had a horrible time withdrawing from it after attempts to end the pain it builds up in the fat cells in the body and requires more and more to feel better medication can help many but benzodiazepines are not a good choice some may be able to comply and not take more than prescribed but it is still damaging i am not a doctor but one who has a lot of experience from the last 15 years as you can see i feel very strongly about ativan i wish the best for all of you hurting it can get better please continue to fight it,1
thank you so much i have a diagnosis of depression and anxiety i basically sit and wait for my next anxiety/ panic attack,1
hugs my daughter has sleep anxiety it took years to get her to sleep normally its still an issue severe ptsd in her case i feel for you its heartbreaking when you cant find peace even in sleep i hope you find a med combo that works and that you feel better throughout the day be well,1

although i dont look miserable when im depressed i tend to look blank or perhaps disinterested people pick up on this and avoid me,0
my gp seems really hesitant to refer to me a psyche i dont know why :/ ive asked about it before,0
it replaced it for me most of the timeover the last 15 yrs i have had periods of deep depression or where rarely the mania would rear its ugly head and i would have to take a low dose of extrelease lithium for a while until things got back under control i also have fibro ptsd and a blood clotting disorder that can cause strokes severe migraines and blood clots i take anxiety meds and cymbalta as well daily when i first went on the topomax i was severely overweight the topomax helped me remedy that in combination with a good diet i lost over 100 lbs in less than a yrso quickly in fact that the doctors said id lost too much and made me gain some back =~p lithium seems to be the only drug (im allergic to alot of others) that can fairly quickly help me to be myself again i hope this help good luck to you,1
every single day it scares the shit out of me that i could even muster up such dark thoughts,0
i saw my therapist todaywho works closely with my doctor she said i look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session she has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on friday to see whats up the nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains cramps nausea etc is not worth it something is definitely wrong they are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since i am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function so its just to wait it out till friday morning thanks all for your support and help this community is amazing,1
it was awful !! especially when i came off i went through horrible withdrawal,0
yes i currently take ambien for the same reason as u i try to avoid taking it my husband woke me up in the morning 4 hours after i had taken it i do not recall any of our conversation he told me that i seemed incoherent and "drugged out",1
i was so sick and scared a few weeks back and i called a crisis hotline and talked to some one and they got me help with in mins they will send you where they can get you some help,1
ill tell you what id do  write him a letter explaining the truth  its eating you alive and you need to apologize to move past it  give it to the headmaster and make peace with the fact its part of the past and think of it like this  it can rest on him  if he wants to hate you  give him that option but it puts "it" on him and releases the guilt for you  once you know you did the right thing by letting him know how you feel about it as in it bothers you to the point of interfering with your life! you should feel better because youve done everything in your power to show him you acknowledge the damage you caused  he might hate you but its gotta feel rewarding to know it hurts you :/  if thats true if not hell forgive you  either way forgive yourself you know your sorry!,0
i know it sucks i have general anxiety disorder what gets me when people dont understand my anxiety when ive been asked to go to places i cant go to places on my own i was asked to go a barge trip down the canal afraid falling the water i cant go a bargei have severe depression two,0
i will constantly black out mid conversation or forget what i just finished saying it gets worse when my anxiety is triggered which will always trigger my agoraphobia,0
i have been in numerous psych units for attempted suicide my last od i was within 15 minutes of dying the last unit was the best thing that ever happened to me the vacation i was referring to is time away from all the problems from the "outside" the groups are so much help for one; you see that you arent the only one get suggestions on how to cope i have ptsd and bpd the structure of being on unit helps you regain some semblance of order lots of times i got a med adjustment there are lots of new meds from all the research mental and physiological i dont know why i am explaining myself for an obvious sarcasm sometimes humor is the only way coping with a stressful world,1
& for wht reason this happened this way well im not too sure y no worries hey heck it happen my life & cant change a thing just keep amoving and well im going too creat or make of something i hope if not the hell im going too not give in or give ,0

to deny who you are is to deny the one that made you if i where to be told something like this - thats what i would say and then i tell them that their comment while probably and in all honesty well meant made me feel like i should be ashamed of who i am i should feel bad for how i think i should feel guilty for accepting that i have an illness i should lie to myself fight myself tear myself apart because i cant be who i am then i would explain that by doing all those things - i would lose any ground i had gained to recover cope and learn how to "be",0
i have almost no libido at all and i am diagnosed with bipolar depression (bipolar ii) i also have other mental illnesses as well like panic disorder and terrible anxiety but could also be my meds either way i dont think that one symptom overrides all the others get a second opinion,1
horrible medication!!!! akathisia!,1
no side effects for me it helps my depression not my anxiety though,1
that sounds like my friend at moment about anxiety and depression,1
it sounds like your parents are really struggling to handle this well but rest assured not everybody will make you feel like this talking to someone that you trust and who will understand could make the world of difference to you there are lots of good people out there best of luck xx,0
i have similar to you except the anxiety is only mild to moderate cymbolta 60mg has changed my world i am doing well on it,1
im training in the medical field and have been with the same paychologist for years and he showed me the dsm-iv-tr and he explained how they diagnose he also told me that the psychosis that presents in depression is often delusions (which i was having at that point hence him explaining this all to me) he also explained schizophrenia bpd bipolar and anxiety (also had severe anxiety at the time; bpd and schizophrenia because one of my relatives has those and bipolar because it was suspected i may be bipolar) my gp also explained them all to as to how they present and a basic medical run down of them so i dont know but i have a feeling that they dont present with audio hallucination; the other issue is mdd even psychotic mdd usually is caused by a serotonin based issue whereas when ssris are given to healthy people they dont tend to cause psychosis where as schizophrenia and bipolar both of which have depressive symptoms (which are usually treated with ssris) as well as psychois (treated with dopamine antagonists called antipsychotics),1
i am so sad to see all of these comments about loved ones leaving or think it over before you commit i understand that its hard for the partner to watch their loved one go through this i have bipolar depression 2 the leaving or doubts about life with someone who suffers this its going to make the person fall deeper into the darkness my boyfriend understands me yes its hard but he supports me and helps me up out of the dark i usually have more lows than highs but hes with in both,0
ive felt this and been woken by panic attacks,0
orespecially after the night i had at work last nighttry this: ;),1
my mom is one person who sets me off when im agitated i cant take being around her and even when i tell her im agitated and we should talk another time shell push until i snap and then make me feel guilty about it,0
wow thats a good one! im sitting here today bored depressed and lonely yet i have a ton of things i need to do but my depression and bipolar anxious mind is making me sick i feel guilty for even thinking of having fun!! or any and everything i want to do will turn into a catastrophe! butim sober and im not portraying any of the ugly symptoms of bipolar like i did 10 years ago with medication and counseling im better for that im happy now to get off my butt and do laundry! lol!,0
so sorry that you have to struggle like that some times its not fair,0
my opinion you should have speak to your doctor but a lot of people with weed the same diagnosis they take medication because the way you feel i think you got to start with a small dose dont get panic all medication has side effect especially psychiatric medication you can lusso gain weight you have to first do you research whatever the doctor wants to prescribe you because that was my problem i didnt know i was supposed to do my research be careful a lot of the medicine they can give you you even diabetic i didnt know why i feel that way that i only want to crave sugar and fat food in greece food but a lot have to be with the medication you have to do a research because its not easy dont get scare at the end of the day we need to get help we got to be responsible not like older they know what they have and they dont look for help so try to be comfortable with your doctor and your therapist if you need both and do you research and try your medication with a small amount of those also so you dont say that satisfied will be really bad like i used to it little by little step by step if i dont work for you its going to take time but one day you will get the right one good luck and god bless,1
sometimes composure comes to late now the guilt and embarrassment sets in i try to stay controlled but if u hit one of my buttons its at ur risk,0
as some have suggested its best to communicate with him and he may be upset when he reads this as your posts may come up in his feed its sad when you feel unloved but many people face depression without a partner so you should discuss your feelings with him if you are engaged you must have trust and feel able to discuss your feelings as for money its immaterial and should not equate to how much someone loves you its sometimes more rewarding just stopping in and listening to music and smiling as for every moment of sadness there will be a new day on the horizon if you can talk to one another you can celebrate everyday and be content knowing that you are not alone concentrate on the good things you share x,0
i cant really function unless i have it the times that i cant have it i get shaky and nauseous and cannot sleep at all its not fun at all but seroquel makes me feel like a normal person,0
i use it during the daytime for anxiety doesnt make you sleepy but calms your nerves,1
upset stomach,0
youre not wrong; that was an immediate natural reaction families are odd but maybe she wasnt disrespecting you but decided to inform everyone of all information in one go social media causes lots of issues between individuals perspective of use (im guilty of this :( ) also ive been in your shoes well done for showing so much love & care for your dad; i hope he improves quickly just bear in mind that this isnt the best time for family fallouts; that will only add to your stress and your dads healing be kind to yourself you cant refill someone else if you are empty (( <3 )),0
my son went off his xanax after many many years with the help of his therapist after all those years he had become addicted and was having more and more panic attacks from using 3 a day dont do it alone need professional help he is doing fine now so it can be done with help baby steps,1
as others have suggested if you feel uncomfortable verbalising things then write it down infact what you have posted is exactly what you should show your dr so that they can make a proper diagnosis or refer to specialist etc,0
please go see a doctor immediately and if one isnt available as soon as possible then admit yourself into the nearest psychiatric hospital you can find i understand your reservations and fears but trust me if you wait until its too late you will be very sorry when i first went manic in 2013 it took less than 2 months for me to have a psychotic break i ended up with legal trouble busting my teeth and ruining my life for years to come simply because i refused to take medicine please seek professional help immediately you are not alone and you dont need to feel hopeless and suicidal sending love and positive vibes take care of yourself because in the end no one can do it for us we all have go through it it passes and gets better not instantaneously and there will always be lows and issues to conquer but every battle we face just makes us stronger dont give up and seek help,0
bpd is short for borderline personality disorder and should not be confused with bipolar disorder,1
i agree with you instant inpatient its almost like my suicide ideation are one of my "coping skills" when shit gets super hard i have had them for 30 years sometimes i start to conjure up a plan but i also have a plan in place to stop planning im very organized in my planning lol but not really lol it is a daily exhausting struggle talking yourself down or up all day long sometimes you just feel like ugh this is ridiculous and you yearn for peace and rest how i perceive these "ideations" i just get sick of the fight i am tired wheres my easy button bc meds just take the edge off i would like pretty please and easy carefree day filled with magical mermaids and sweet tarts l,0
i have a few things that trigger this reaction i try to avoid them when i can,0
yes this happened yesterday and my son and i about had a nervous breakdown it would get so loud,0
i have a huge issue with motivation i cant get going and the thought of doing some things gives me a feeling of dread sounds pathetic i know but thats the way it is with me i feel flat most of the time but at least im not depressed my medication is working ok but dont know what to do about motivation,0
i avoid having a relationship due to my depression & not wanting to go anywhere or communicate with other people & sometimes find it hard to get out of bed or even getting out my pjs & getting dressed for the day its horrible no one understands me i have no support,0
i too suffer from bipolar ii and anxiety instead of changing up your medicines maybe you could just add a temporary medication to help you through this time,1
michelle osullivan yes i just started it in july we are moving very slowly and it takes a lot of getting used to she was the one who suggested i ask my brother to check in on me once in a while but i went about it all the wrong ways and got too emotional then when he told me that he wouldnt tell me what he wanted to say to her i got uncomfortable like i was going to be thrown under the bus and then he got angry and just bit my head off,0
welcome to the club it is really hard when our loved ones are severely mentally ill we feel like we are getting ill too because of the stress of it i have a hard time with communication when my loved one is getting more ill also there is a lot you can read online and there are some good books written also it was hard for me to learn not to challenge delusions it is hard to realize that they are ill and to not take their anger personally when i was a child we had to get my mother to the hospital but we always put it off as long as possible hoping unrealistically that she would get some sleep and feel better my mother would get manic after she was in the hospital for a while she would say " why didnt you get me here sooner?" but when she was so sick she did not want to go hang on to the fact that she will be feeling better soon although it may be a while these days they are required to go to groups in the hospital and they do get to think about mental health and how to stay healthy mentally you can go to a support group held by nami for families that may help you,0
for whatever reason i had to take the name brand of it effexor bc i couldnt tolerate the generic it helped with my fibromyalgia but not so much the anxiety or depression,1
that was named "specific phobia" in anxiety they dont have enough room to name everyones shit,1
thats a tough one sweetheart if you are over 18 you only need your parents support not permission you should never have been given an intern only in the first place they work under the supervision of licensed personel try to obtain information on the therapists they have and request the one you want you may have to go through a few to find the right fit only you will know that -- if you feel uncomfortable unsafe in any discussions or see or feel no improvement you can talk with your therapist or dr about the need for hospitalization if you feel time is of the essence check yourself in they will usually begin and monitor any medications you may need as well as counseling and support from others like you dont be afraid also consider all the options in your area for treatment if you are not 18 you need someone to talk to your parents for you as it doesnt appear that they see the importance of your receiving treatment maybe you have a school counselor teacher or another family member who can speak on your behalf in my experience clergy and psychological treatment do not mix well they are separate faith is very important i cannot express enough how vital early intervention is to recovery!!!! the older you get the harder it will be whatever you do dont give up on yourself or others i wish you the very best good luck!,0
do you know if hes having a manic episode depressive or mixed? i live with bipolar disorder and i have different methods for different episodes the hardest part about a depressive episode for me is that there is literally just no stimulation in my brain someone could run in my room with fireworks and i probably wouldnt react much to it but because i accepted that my brains chemistry isnt reacting properly and i know this ive learned to force myself to get restimulated its not easy at all and its a process that can take days or weeks with many speed bumps but 1 i get a decent amount of sunlight every day 2 i do something active every day even if its only a 15 minute walk but i try to at least go for a 30 minute run to get the juices flowing also killing 2 birds with one stone if you run outside 3 i make a short to do list every day nothing crazy maybe 3-4 things and a lot of days i only do one or none and its frustrating and i want to give up and go back to bed and quit but the next day i get up and try it again and i tell myself its ok and try to maintain positive thoughts because the anxious and bad thoughts i know arent organic they arent my thoughts theyre called intrusive thoughts for a reason they come and they go but i dont let them decide who i am as a person eventually after a while of pushing myself i start realizing that i want to run when i wake up and i want to get that school assignment done and i want to take care of myself and continue building the foundation of my future as a partner of someone living with bp i would suggest being that gentle support suggest going on a walk or run with them or ask them if they at least want to sit outside for a bit maybe invest in something like a hammock they still dont have to move or leave home but they at least are outside which is one small step closer the to do list is big for me my anxiety builds up exponentially when i let things like school or work pile up and it makes me shut down even harder but when i start getting things done no matter how small or simple it really helps my confidence come back (crossing things off a to do list has been known to be a good way to release dopamine and help stimulate the brain) i hope this helps feel free to message me if you have any questions,0
i feel the same when my anxiety sets in and i cant do anything like cleaning the house i feel like a failure because i am not able to do all the things "normal"people do,0

what dose of zoloft are you taking? i felt exactly like you (zombified) when i was taking only 50 mg despite my hesitancy my psychiatrist increased my dose he explained that low doses affect the sleep stimulator in the brain as a result a higher dose is necessary,1
its not about being stupid because you walk away it can be really hard to stay when you have tried everything i have supported my partner every single day for nearly 6 years i have struggled with my own mental health for over 45 years with numerous suicide attempts 1 since we met i am 53 my partner is 29 never assume that someone is stupid it could be that you have done all that you can?,0
ian are you talking about your own loss? or have you ever experienced suicidal thoughts? because these are two different things entirely and i have never seen them treated separately it seems that there is more emphasis on families who have lost a loved one but those who have attempted suicide and recovered are leftovers just like an addict who is expected to be able to keep clean when they leave treatment people like us are expected to go on living but arent given the skills nor the support therapy can only go so far that doesnt often get rid of the thoughts when a depressive cycle begins its not like those cycles are only a few days they can last weeks months and then just as quickly you will be thrust into a manic cycle it is exhausting! also families fail to learn about this disease because they are terrified of it and there is a lot of dysfunction within the family,0
i know its scary been there myself but remember that everyone there is going thru their own hell and can relate no one judges there youll get understanding and respect believe in yourself! my prayers are with you honey!!,0

i love how seroquel has helped me i am able to sleep without paranioa and hearing voices i even wake up well rested refreshed and in a good mental head space the only thing is it makes me a horrible midnight snacker  therefore i gained a lot of weight now im not as heavy  all i did to curve the weight gain was i took all my favorite snack foods and replaced them with healthier alternatives and plus i walk to exercise i take 300mg at night before bedtime the only other nuisance is that some days it takes about 1-2 hours to take effect but most of the time it knocks me out in 45 minutes ,1
meds scare me ive taken them before and the side effects are terrible,1

visteril is actually an allergy medication they also use for sleep and anxiety i have constant difficult anxiety and visteril does absolutely nothing for me i know meds work different with each person this is just my experience the only thing that has worked for me is a combination of a mood stabilizer anti depressant and dissolable klonipin i love the dissolable klonipin when im starting to have an anxiety attack or my anxiety is just high in general i dissolve one of my klonipin in my mouth and it works almost instantly regular pill form does not work for me at all it just takes too long and doesnt work the same good luck,1

ive come to the point where i realize that those thoughts are a just symptom that is part of my condition and like any other symptom i try to address the source i know the source is my brain chemistry and that its hereditary and i accept that its an illness/condition ill have for the duration i let it wash over me with the knowledge that it will pass some days are much harder than others and some day i literally have to give myself permission to lie down and go to sleep i find that sleep usually not always but usually straightens out my thinking knowing what is is though and knowing the patterns and accepting my condition on its terms and mine helps it doesnt make it easy nor am i happy that this is my struggle but it helps,0

first i cant tell you what to do or how to do it all i can do is tell you my experience with this i was born with brain damage caused by the doctor which left me in a state of really bad disorders so you could say i led what does from the day i was born not know why i was so different from the other kids until i started asking questions i learned about my disorders but when it really got bad this after my ex left and took the kids to parts unknown ive had two nervous breakdowns and the first one was really bad i tried three times to kill myself twice with a shotgun and once with pills it was weeks later my doctor found out about the pills banding a map i took along with alcohol i should have died that day but i got the worst case of diarrhea i had to sit on the toilet all day and half the night i realized i couldnt kill myself but i didnt know i was going to die not once but twice in one evening months later i had gotten bit by a rattlesnake halfway point between where i live to where the hospital where i got the anti-venom because the hospital here only had two vials halfway to the other hospital i had died twice first time i died the emt brought me back but then i died again the second time i woke up and seen emt coming at me what the paddles to shock me back to life which he almost shocked himself when i asked him what he was doing then i realize my chest was hurting me he had been pounding on my chest to get my heart started back up again he had told me but during the time i was dead i thought i would just dreaming i still felt the pain and hurts not the physical hurts but the mental hurts thats what i learned it dont matter you still feel the mental hurts even after death keep in mind i still think about suicide but then i start to think about im still in pain even after death the best thing as find something you like to do and do it as long as its legal fill your days with activities so you dont have time to think even if it means doing it by yourself just dont stay and one spot and do nothing this is not going to stop it from happening but it will lessen the pain because if youre too busy doing something that can be enjoyable then you wont have time to think about the other things the key is to stay active and do it when you dont feel like doing it also keep in mind dont push too hard a little bit at a time will build you up then to try to do it all at once last time can be done with anxiety and panic attacks dont ever brush it or try to do it like others do it do it at your own pace so get active and stay active also keep in mind no one can make you do anything but nothing can be accomplished by doing nothing talk to who you can even if its only on the internet i hope and pray this can help you but its up to you to want to do it,0
i had a massive panic attack once when out with my sister saw someone who looked like my abusive biological mom i told her i needed to find somewhere to hide for a bit she said she could see the panic on my face she helped me find a hideaway then stood outside it to protect me while i got it under control when i came out she just asked if i was ok and we went on doing what we were doing b,0

i also got approved very quickly i applied in march and had my first check in june of that year it helped that they had all my work records and medical records showing the years i spent up to 6 months in and out of the hospital when i went to their psychologist he talked to me for a bit and at the end of the 45 minute visit he told me not to worry he was approving me yes on average there is a bit of a fight to get approved but dont let fear of the fight stop you from going through the process you never know what the outcome will be,0

it sounds like you need to work with a therapist to address your anxieties medication will not solve feelings of insecurity and you may be thinking it will your symptoms dont sound like bipolar but have your dr do a full assessment bipolar depression and regular depression both suck and can last a long time if not managed effectively,1

i would go intricate here but in a nutshell (but feel free to ask or direct messages me) if a particular batch of people wasnt tampering with the reality and offsetting of polarisation in the world and people which is accompanied by severe sociopaths and narcopaths the poles of energies that make us up wouldnt be confused nor would would be in a orchestrated narcissistic world!! alone and isolated one must find solitude and within oneself serendipity and contentment even if no ones innerstands you i found several major puzzle pieces to what is going on and the deeper mechanics that unveil and expand and repair our consciousness mind and body somewhat anywhoo wholeness ♾ listen to what is the matrix by secret energy #np on #soundcloud ,0
i attempted suicide at age 13 my mom shamed me got angry w methen i became aneorxic and lost 35 lbs in a month she didnt noticethen she died suddenly of a stroke while we were on april vacation from school she was alive when we went on vaca dead and creamated when we went backno one knew it was awful my life was awful after that for sooo many years i truly thought she died to punish me cuz she didnt love me so i hated myselfit was awful its been 40 yrs now and m much better but it still hurts,0

i feel like that and im hearing you loud okay just a while ago only an hour or so i wás feeling like there was nothing in this world who will ever understand my feelings i caught it and held onto it and felt that if i didnt live it wouldnt matter i felt so hopeless that nobody understands and to understand is to love and if i didnt have love what would i do? die? im too frightened every time i try so its not working death wont work its not our time so what did i love? i love the world and i want to be a part of its healing it doesnt matter if people understand its enough that i do and the very few who know and love me understand the rest dont matter they are the sad ones cos they dont allow their minds to open and to accept that they maybe the ones harming us,0
i was never diagnosed with adhd until around age 30 desperate i did a round of tests like it sounds you did i was complating going back to school but didnt want to if it was just some else i was going to fail at my results were helpful the iq testing gave me a number that told me i wasnt too stupid to try this and when we found the right medicine lets just say i made an a in a course i had failed once and taken an incomplete in the second time since youve already finished testing find out everything you can from them it reassured me and can help you in making plans for the future,0
i have bpd and from my own experience i need a lot of attention and love if i dont get it i can slip into a bad mood which ends up turning into a whole lot worse at times! i need a lot of listening and understanding even when im babbling on about stupid small things lots of hugs i take a lot out on my partner at times when the world hurts me i get upset at him and hes gone a very long way to figure out what to do with the situation and what not to do with it we still struggle at times and as far as we know he doesnt have a "disorder/label" like we do to add to the mix! it takes a lot of hard work but its so good when you do get to a point where you both understand enough about each other to not affect each other negatively ❤️ the best part about your situation is that you can get each other on a different level with your experiences dealing with your conditions! and you can take your meds together which is always a bonus as i forget mine too often hahaha and always remember that things said and done cant be undone so a but of space between the two of you is a blessing as long as its communicated to the other properly ❤️,0

talk with your doctor about seroquel i dont know how old u r but it is black boxed in the us for older people the elderly have a heightened risk of death from this med other annoying side effects include high blood sugar and orthostatic hypotension which is a fancy way of saying when u chafe position too fast (sit or stand up) your blood pressure can really drop and u can fall down or black out this is a drug with a lot of side effects you should talk to your doctor and evaluate the pros and cons todecide if this is the best drug for u,0
this is one of those platitudes i hate and wish people would stop using time and love doesnt always make things better and when they dont get better it makes the person that was already struggling feel like they must be doing something wrong or arent good enough to figure it all out empty platitudes make things worse,0
first thing you should do before anything is to go to a dr you dont want to take a chance and cause further damage everybodys face is different now i will agree that the acne is secondary you need to work on your strength learn to not let people bother you so much there are people out there who find you beautiful if you need to see a therapist then do that or just find someone anyone with a good heart we all have faults the mean people poke at you to avoid their faults fuck them!!!,1

the people at my church when i was in high school ignored me the other girls never knew what to say because they couldnt relate it was like i didnt exist youth group was awful the other girls could talk and cry and got listened to and hugged but no one ever said anything to me either there was an awkward silence or they would act like i hadnt said anything the leaders of the group basically said it was my own fault yeah good christians right? i dont even bother going to church anymore i dont have to be a church member to be a christian,0

i left my abusive home life 2weeks before i was 17 i called the cops myself as i was leaving to make sure i could legally leave and everything however the adults involved did report that i "ranaway" so we went to court i brought my best friend who helped me move and was victim to vial threats made during the move and i brought the adult who was making sure i kept my act together - he had served over seas twice the judge heard both sides then i swear to you he looked at the adults i left and laughed and told them they were stupid and he told me to go continue my new life **i also did not drive nor have a job ** so dont let anyone tell you you that you deserve to be beat or mentaly or emotional (god forbid sexually) abused its scary and hard but you can do it,0

im bipolar 1 but also diagnosed with ptsd anxiety ocd and adhd i have yet to find anything that works for me adderall helped my adhd by allowing me to better focus but gave me the jitters triggering anxiety issues im so over it! there are so many different medications out there but finding the right one is never-ending especially for those of us that suffer from more than on disorder because then its about never-ending combinations exhausted,1

ive suffered from depression since i was 14 and recently the last couple of years im having a lot of anxiety but ive never been put on meds for either ive just learnt to deal with it i guess and have learnt how to pull my self out of it now im 25 this year and i think i may need some help as my mood swings are getting to much i stress way to much or i feel down do i have to go thru 5 different meds to find the one for me or are they gunna make me worse is whats always turned me off :(,1
idk struggle with this myself,0
i can totally relate ive lost so many friends and have pushed so many friends away because of the depression or the manic episodes where i get easily irritated no one gets it but a few of my friends who have similar mental illnesses its so tough to explain to someone who doesnt get it i cant just shut it off itll never go away even with all the medication and therapy ive had it still remains there just waiting to pop up again and granted the medicines help and therapy helps but nothing can stop it completely and youre just so stuck trying to fight it off the best you can,0
cats are very intuitive also mine stays with me when stressed or depressed she is a rock,1
when i took lamictal i would have severe anger then the next minute i would be crying uncontrollably for me it was the worst med ive taken my dr took me off immediately,1
its a good place to start but my depression and anxiety can be rooted in the present as well sometimes more so,1
not sure about the meds but you only see them 15 min? i see mine 1hr/month bpd is complicated and id really doubt in 15 min they could get an accurate feel for your current situation,0
i dont know if its the eclipse but im cycling i just went through the angry rage hate and irritability of hypomania and now im in the very deep hole of depression god i hate this disease ,0
brian castaneda i am so proud of everything youve done thats brought you to where you are today you deserve recognition for your struggles hardships and successes in that,0

i would get a restraining order if he is abusive and make a request to the court that he seeks therapy and is on his medication before he can come home and has proof of completion before you divorce if he doesnt then consider it also prayer helps forgive him thats for you the more u are holding grudges and are bitter the more the therapy wont work also get him the book bipolar for dummies make a family plan how to be a support system make sure he knows that his children are predisposed to bipolar disorder bc he has it but if the kids arent showing symptoms they can reduce the chances of showing symptoms by reducing stress in the environment something is stressing him out and it needs sto be addressed in a calm manner before his children are effected permanently by this toxic environment,1
i usually enjoy my manic phases during them im more social energetic and productive but afterwards i tend to be self conscious and anxious about the things i may have said or did,0
and didnt see specific phobia so excuse me,1
i really hope you arent trying to be demeaning or minimizing our struggles,0
first youve got to tell this to family your child needs to be safe so you can get a break and sort yourself out parents? siblings? fathers parents? who can take the pressure off you for a week or so? if youre failing classes you need to look at your options talk to your teachers and tell them you have a medical situation causing this temporary slump in grades but what are your options? you may need time off due to the break up because you wont be able to concentrate or sleep well and free counseling is something you probably need to heal try and stay on the meds and let them settle new meds take about six weeks to fully work good luck! dont forget to find a bipolar support group in your area,1
this is more like maintaining mental health if you have it exercise is really hard when you struggle just to get out of bed -_-,0
it says " im a queen " with a semicolon because ive battled for so long with depression anxiety disorder etc " im a queen" because queens are strong independent and amazing but they still can ask for help when needed,1
this is my post i am so lost i feel like im going crazy and i feel like im losing it it is so scary i have been fighting the suicidal thoughts for so long i cant shake it,0
my history is very similar to yours the disease damaged your ability to manage your life properly not you per say i was told i am grieving the loss of who i was before this disease took hold i also take and anti seizure med tegretol which had helped immensely however i am also on valium for anxiety and sleep i also take ambien for sleep this med is the one that truly made a difference i have been on wellbutrin and buspar and sadly really never helped everyone needs their own specific "cocktail" to be effective i wish you all the best "if you find yourself in hell keep going"~winston churchill this quote has helped me laugh and to keep moving forward i wish the same for you!❣️,1
all medications require you to see a dr the longer you leave it the worse your symptoms are going to be you just have to push through your anxiety and make the step to see a dr,1
do you take propranonal for anxiety?,1
when youve exhausted all of your options and are still so miserable youd rather die,0
seroquel gave me horribly violent nightmares and yes i experienced some aggressive feelings,0
yes ive hidden my anxiety and depression for years i never talked about it i suffered in silence and felt so alone i dont apologise for it anyway more,0
lack of corauge was and it is the reason i dont do it one day the pain will stop i just dont know how i suffer of anxiety i made a treatment months ago but now im feeling bad again as i have depressive components my head is a ticking bomb im not diagnosed with depression cuz i never went back to the doctor after my anxiety treatment because i was afraid of something i already know being strong but i dont know till when today a boy as killed himself in my hometown he jumped a bridge that made me feel so bad i only imagined it was me,0
being selfish keeping good boundaries up and try to catch yourself overthinking/worrying those all have helped me,1
yes definitely how i feel about it its a daily struggle and a nightmare,0

i understand that it may sound weird but i hope that is a real thing because im a worrier and question everything while my bipolar diagnosis fits especially when i looked at my behavior leading up to the diagnosis it also worries me that they were wrong and im just a horny pervert ya know so either way whether the hypersexuality due to bipolar or a sex addiction at least i would know im not alone and that i can get help,0
people say that suicide is cowardly it is not as it is a desperate act triggered by agony beyond words images and sounds the persons nervous systems lines of communication are tangled in unbearably painful knotts (victoria arango),0
laurie hollister thank you! since i lost my therapy ive had to find ways to cope on my own i know how it is to struggle with suicidal thoughts and i know the deep need to get help and want to just be ok if my advice can help then im happy,0
i think you might need to try a less stressful environment with predictable patients and hours- could you work in an office? like a physicians office? or have you thought of applying for disability? it is not much money but after two years you get access to health care,1
been at my psychiatrist todayhe says (after 20+ years bipolar diagnosis) that i have " unstable personality disorder" can you tell me what this means in relation to pip? i havent got the letter yet and am really confused as it seemingly encompasses disacociative disorder with non epileptic episodes/blackouts due to which ive had to surrender my driving licence help!!!!!!!,1
i dont have a lot of money but what i do make sure to do is order my groceries online from shop rite when im having a down week its about $15 extra for them to shop and deliver it but its worth it if otherwise you wont have food i would get cheap stuff like ramen and cup of soup maybe try to get some protein shakes because lack of protein can cause problems with serotonin (i just read something about that the other day) a good goal would be to try to go outside to get your mail every day just so you see the light of day or even just open a window its impossible to think about but those things might help,0
if you can i think some form of exercise would take the edge off the anxiety and relieve some depression,1
ive been hanging serios anxiety lately and its the only way i list weight itseems like i just keep gaining sucks,0

try to find a doc who will do extensive blood work to make sure all hormones are balanced and everything else is balanced integrative family medicine doctors do this and prescribe bioidenticals if needed then cut out gluten and anything else irritating to balance read the book "the mood cure" especially if you dont want pharmaceuticals,1
so my hubby and i are both bipolar its not easy relationships are hard work that said if your bf isnt supportive or willing to work with you make compromises then you will be miserable but i also want to say being around people who are not bipolar is important in your journey to being independent and well maybe find some books do some research find what works for you finding a distraction from the negatives will help you out of those odd anxious feelings i personally believe that diet sleep exercise hydration and supplements help so much with regulating your body and brain chemistry i found that birth control caffeine sugar and synthetic dyes all affect my mood negatively where ever you are on your journey you can always improve your experience with knowledge and personal trail and error dont let anyone bring you down or put you in an uncomfortable situation just for theyre own sake your worth staying home for,1
warning : may be a trigger if not allowed please delete then i must be weak yesterday around 3 -4am i couldnt fight the monster anymore i thought i had enuff fight in me but no luck im so embarrassed for what i did and feel so stupid for doing it  i self harmed / suicide attempt  i am just putting this out there so maybe one person can relate and get the help that they need  call your nearness crisis line or call 911 please i waited about 12 - 14 hours after i did it  one side of my brain was telling me to call to get the help i need but the other side of my brain was telling me no  i called n got help that i need i am home now under 24 hour watch for the next couple days  my choice since hospitals are a very big trigger for me  sorry for being so long i just needed to tell my story  stay strong keep fighting never give up,0
i take 6 different medications each day obviously they all differ in amount (mg) strength/type of drug & treatment/reason for which theyre prescribed its not about how many medications you take its about finding the right combination & dosage to level you or to improve your health dont worry about the amount or number of medications your on worry about feeling whether theyre working for you but please make sure to have your lithium levels checked regularly i have mine checked every 3 months,1
i was on prozac for 3-4 months it was for stress induced seizures i had these side effects i took myself off and cleansed my system about a week and a half later i was ok,1
wellbutrin brought on mania for me irrational anger and agitation is mania for many of us i do not know your diagnosis but it is well documented that most anti- depressants are not a good solution for bi polar disorder,1
call someone you know and trust immediately dont be afraid or ashamed im sure theres someone in your phone who youd drop everything for in an emergency try a few people out you will be surprised obviously if its late at night you may not get an immediate response so do not let that get you down if no luck call an ambulance if its night time get in bed and have a good sleep then reflect on your situation in the morning and see a doctor yesterday its not abnormal to feel like this - yes its an illness but plenty of normal people suffer these things and they just hide it better (which is a bad thing and often makes you worse) i hesitate to get directly involved with other sufferers but if you are stuck for someone to talk to you are welcome to send me a message,0
this is new to me but i understand it im very bipolar and i make destructive decisions and irrational choices what type do you think i am? be nice to see what yall think so when i get to dr i get medicine that helps,0
er if she wont go call a doctor to find out how you get an emergency psych hold you may need to see if she has a medical power of attorney she could be in a depressive psychosis which is no joke better safe than sorry dont worry about pissing her off better she be alive and pissed than dead,1
no its not ive been diagnosed with depression anxiety and paranoia what help you getting for it? i find cbt seems good im getting apps booked in to see the local mh team to sort this out google cbt and what it is this might help you as well as medication? if youre taking anything,1
set your alarm on your phone,0
that is a lot to go through in a short period of time certainly you have went through a lot of emotional trauma as well as abandoment issues i would be quite hesitant if a doctor diagnosed some one at the age with a bipolar or even many other mental illness the reason is because for one puberty certainly had not hit at that young of an age other reasons would be that we learn emotional reactions from our environment which in turn means we can learn better coping skills by no means am i saying there is nothing wrong simply that it is worth looking at things from a different angle,1
hmmm my meds fucked me up ive been on tons of different medication and each time i get worse i currently off of meds and even feel worse (if anyone has had a med that works let me know) ive been on prozac celexa wellbutrin lamictal lorazapam ambien and even lithium none have helped ive even had the anti-anxiety ones such as xanax but nothing helps i might be a hopeless case,1
i had horrid side effects from sertraline as did my son i had severe hot flushes and hallucinations my son began self harming we both immediately stopped the sertraline in saying this i know many other people that take it with no issues,0
deppression should be taken serious! its scary! i know i have it with bi-polar people may look at like your happy but inside your cofused you see deathbut you keep smiling its sad i know then there are the ones deppressed who shout out for help and everyone thinks they are wanting attention no! no! they are actually shaking people and saying "yea i do want attention im trying to get you to lift them upso they wont take that drastic decisiondeath cuz everyone dont believe you anymoreif you dont change things open your heart and listen i might years down the road mean they not i,0
i have been denying my diagnosis but the more i read maybe its true because this is me an i dont even realize im doing it but its ok many people are very successful and that suffer it so im not going to let this stop me from living i am socially unacceptable which im not to worried because a lot of what they accept i dont want to be part of its all messed up because people who know just sit back and watch thats wrong,0
love the productive and creative side of mania  hate the irritability and conflict that it brings though,0
hi it sounds as though you have been through so much it isnt surprising that you are struggling having cancer and having to undergo chemo must have been gruelling enough on its own i know it can be terrible it sounds as though you have done so well coming out the other side so to speak in a sense should be easier but it might be a time when you start to relax ie it might not feel such a fight but also your goal has been achieved to get through all that so you might be sub consciously thinking; what now? what do i have to focus on? having depression/anxiety can be a very lonely place it can be a mixture of feeling very alone but also not doing things to engage and pushing people away feeling no one cares unfortunately people lead such busy lives for one reason or another have you been able to talk to any of your family to explain how you feel? it sounds with the psychologist (not sure if thats the exact title i cant refer back to your post whilst typing) that you really need someone you can have a two way dialogue with im not sure by just talking at someone will necessarily provide a full and satisfactory experience its a bit of an odd form of communication when u receive very little feedback im sure others might suggest help and support from charities but not sure how things like that work out where you are is there anyway you could become more involved with grandchildren? please forgive me if i havent all the facts just trying to think of things which might help trying to introduce enjoyable things or activities with meaning often help could you volunteer for a charity? sometimes by helping others this can help people to feel needed and worthy small steps towards a bigger eventual goal are often key to getting better having more things in life with meaning can help with self confidence self esteem and having more things to focus on i know its far from easy and its important not to run before you can walk but gradually trying to introduce a few new experiences might help long term best wishes x,0
years of fighting depression my father a self harmer my sister suffering a complete breakdown and a daughter with ptsd youre in your own horror movie never ending x,0

i was started on it it did nothing for my anxiety i still had severe anxiety attacks while i was on it and was switched to xanax and finally got some relief,1
i would imagine the fact you are looking for teaching posts is causing some stress and anxiety you - most people would feel under pressure in this situation so its not abnormal to feel like that you should write down exactly how you are feeling to try and identify the trigger which may enable you to move forwards and try and address it your gp could increase your dosage as 20 mg is lowest dose of prozac or there are many it her anti depressants which are also good got anxiety such as sertraline (zoloft),1
i have bipolar 2 and take effexor and wellbutrin in am and 600 mg (neurontin) gabapentin + 5 mg clonazepam at night has not been a problem at all i have an anxiety disorder as well never was on seroquel or remeron but did take saphris at night for a while which was great for sleep but did gain weight and had to quit because i couldnt afford it also still have left over weight gain from a trial of lithium that just made me too sluggish hope this helps,1
i vape cbd oil it only helps my anxiety a little bit,1
when i was younger i remember my little sister had toileting issues until she was 8 years old doctors found a minor issue with her bladder it wasnt serious but eventually it happened for her maybe you could take your little one to see a doctor about her issue with toileting? this could really help yours & hers situation & relieve some of the stress on yourself id also recommend seeking government assistance/support to help with your financial situation until your back on your feet & id defer university for a semester its not easy to go through what your going through although there are steps you can take to ease or even rectify your greatest stresses lastly if your psych isnt meeting your needs try explaining this to him/her otherwise search for one you feel would be more suitable for you,1
i started low on quitipine now i am on 600 at night this last mounth i have become so ill nearly was addmited to helston hospital to day i have a med review as i still needing help i got to say my doctor and my care worker helping me best as they can never lie to them be as onisted as you can and to all you other being horrible to this person who needs help not you stupid fucking judgment,1
i pretty sure u need a moid stabilizer w bipolar 2 none of those are mood stabilizers anxiety will be lower w mood stabilizer prob wont need ativan and is ur dr using gabapentin for anxiety may not need that if dr ordered u a mood stabilizer,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar when i was 25 now i am 44 years old it has been a very long hard struggle i have been seeing a psychiatrist this whole time along with one on one therapist group therapy which i really enjoy so 8 months ago i was hired as a peer support specialist at kingsview were i have been recieving treatment for almost 20 years i always thought of my diagnosis and all the hospitalizations and loosing contact with all my friends and alot of my family that me being bipolar with anxiety was a curse that god was punishing me i no longer feel that way because everything that i struggled through made me stronger brave courageous and i can relate to others who have also struggled my life journey isn"t a curse it is a gift,0
u need to relax try rest have a massage if it continues see a doctor better that than it getting worse say you having trouble sleeping and relaxing quetiapine was v gd even in a small dose to be able to rest i tuk this after childbirth ask bout this what meds are you on dont worry sometimes it feels as if its too much and when u cant sleep you think its gona go into a relapse this happened many times to me it doesnt stop worrying try rest / put bad thoughts to one side,1
i have bipolar anxiety bpd and agoraphobia i take the least amount of meds as i can now because when i was younger o was way over medicated and was like a zombie basically i take wellbutrin for my depression and xanax for anxiety the xanax is not working very well now because i have a tolerance for it but it did help a lot on the beginning,1
ask to try proprananol its worked really well with my anxiety x,1
i spoke to my stepsons when youngest was 3 and again this year youngest age 4 i dont fully explain it but i told them sometimes i have trouble with my emotions and get really sad and cry a lot or angry and yell when you dont deserve it and i dont mean to do it and anytime that i do yell and they dont deserve it once ive calmed down i talk to them and apologize for my actions this has stopped them from getting as upset when i get like that (im rapid cycling bipolar no meds) when im sad they try to comfort me without being overbearing and if im really tired they will behave and let me nap on the couch (light sleeper) while they quietly play or watch a movie and they wake me if movie ends they are hungry or thirsty they are amazing at understanding how i am but ive also been in their lives from 6m and 18m respectively,0
if you ever need someone to just listen while you talk im here for you im bipolar 1 borderline personality disorder high anxiety depression and ptsd i am fairly stable on my meds ive been there with everything youre saying i know how it feels so please add me if you would ever like someone to talk to or just listen i will be here for you remember you life has value and meaning you have a purpose in life you are worth so much more than you give yourself credit for,0
i remember feeling numb in the past its horrible being told by your doctor that you have no feelings im also going through a medication change all i want to do is sleep and drown the voices out with music on my mp3 player dont worry i know my medication is causing this like amber murder aguero says try to talk to him explaining how you feel its not unusual to feel numb do you blame him for any of your troubles if so its love you go against the people you love the most,0
i feel that every single day so frightening living alone thru those episodes i cant even go to the grocery store anymore perspiration drips from my face soaking my hair and clothes its that petrafying im told i have to fight thru it im becoming agoraphobic,0
try not to think about it that way bro think about the positives i personally deal with the same kind of stuff i scare myself thoughts of suicide every single minute of everyday but i just try as much as i can to distract myself and if i cant then i will admit i take it out on myself ( self harm ) but its better than the alternative im here for you if you ever wanna just chat,0
first off your illness had nothing to do with what you did 10 year olds know right from wrong no amount of rumors made you do it either blaming your illnesses is wrong because you do have conscious smh secondly whats done is done the past is the past for a reason as far as wanting forgiveness ruining a teachers welfare and reputation probably isnt going to be fixed with im sorry so you were illno pass sorry you knew what you were doing you even said you felt guilt  you just need to live with it and move on ,0
being angry and full of rage isnt usually part of the manic phase youre angry and irritable because you dont feel good depression gets to you that way while nothing completely takes it away for me there are things that help me take the edge off talking to a friend can help relieve some pressure if you have family nearby hugs and positive statements can go a long way getting outside for a walk and getting a little exercise can help all of that is easier said than done being depressed and holding back anger is exhausting and its hard to leave the house sometimes you may need to consider medication its not a cure but it can help much of the time,0
i would probably explain to them that bipolar disorder is the same as having cancer you cant just make it go away if they wont accept that i would probably unfriend because who needs that crap (i say this as a person with both bipolar and with cancer the bipolar scares me more they cut the cancer out),1
testing for all that?! get another dr be just honest and open with your symptoms - all of them even the good ones anxiety can be related to paranoia which is a scale and not just thinking aliens are after you or some shit,1
no matter how much we want our families to understand what we go through they never will the only people who have true empathy for us are our fellow survivors i say survivors because we have to battle our brains on a daily basis but we survive maybe we go through this to be able to help one another ive been fighting this battle for over 40yrs my life is chaotic on the inside but its still a life worth living most people fear what they dont understand and will lash out and we scare the hell out of them all you can say to them is that "this is what i need to do to live my life your approval is not needed but your help would be appreciated" seek out a support group as a place to vent your daily problems feelings fears etc so you can see that you arent alone in this when we isolate ourselves and only use our family for support it will amplify the pain suicide usually happens in a moment of helplessness and darkness it sucks at that moment but it will pass find something right now that you have a passion for it can be anything that makes you feel happy and alive if you need to loose yourself in books movies video games searching the internet hiking listening to music going out with a friend etc go for it just tell the illness that you need a break and delve into something you want to do its a part of you but not the only part of you just know that you were born this way because your soul is strong and can find your way and all the people who commented are sending you support acceptance of who you are and love for a fellow human being we care about you and the pain youre in we see you you are not alone,0

thank you! thats been the only way for me i could not go out there to find satisfaction for it would weigh heavy on my conscience i would never be able to forgive myself for *using* another for my own personal need/gain i do not judge others to each his own right i just wasnt brave enough to try it wouldve been more satisfying no doubt there was also the fear of being rejected i dont think that would have happened but the fear was always there but for me my butterfly is my favorite ( the urgency can and has happened away from home) tmi - my apologies,0

1 big hugs 2 you are not alone 3 take the medication as it should help it will take time for the medication to work if it doesnt dont give up hope ask to see a psychiatrist they are better at diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues it is a chemical imbalance in the brain and its nothing to be ashamed of i am bipolar and the medications i take let me be me again i laugh and have fun and im social again but i lost 10 years-10 very important years being stubborn and figuring i could out will the feelings of sadness be brave try the meds - i know you are scared but it does get better the fact you have reached out and asked for help makes you very brave if you get the urge to attempt suicide please go to the closest emergency room as they will be able to help you or call a help line,1
ok i could have been the one who wrote this post back in 2001 the most important thing is to find the resources available to you on campus i went to umass amherst and they had psychologists and psychiatrists right on campus that took my insurance a good place to start would probably be with your ra there are places to go right on campus biggest thing: find a professional who you can talk to and if you feel that they arent a good fit try someone else not all doctors are for everyone and trust is so important dont be afraid to find one that fits i struggled so much before i got the help i needed you need to be patient with yourself and take care of *you* first looking back i wish i had taken a semester or 2 off to get myself settled i felt too much pressure not to though which wasnt the best for me i missed so many classes it was ridiculous i withdrew from classes and bombed entire semesters the simple act of moving to college triggered my depression ive struggled since there are a lot of resources please please take advantage of them also keep in mind that afsporg and namiorg are excellent places to talk to people theres even a chat on afsporg if memory serves! you can pm me on here if youd like to hang in there (excuse any typos) -terri,1

andy nicholson i was also mostly responding to someone who said it was "selfish" which i feel is a guilt-tripping word i get what you were saying and by all means remind them of those who do love them or if it is a loved one tell them how much they mean to you tell them why you love them and stuff focus on them and the positive impact they have in peoples lives,0

i was diagnosed at 14 i am now 27 and have 2 beautiful girls while it is definitely on my mind and i am constantly on the watch for signs of mental illness i am so very grateful for the love of my girls i honestly contemplated suicide a few months ago the only thing that kept me out of that dark place was the thought of them having to see me in a casket and asking why i would never wake up i understand that they have a higher chance of developing the disorder since i have it but i feel like i will be prepared to help them should they inherit it i do fear for them as any mother would and i struggle with the "what ifs" and the guilt if they do develop it but "what if" i worry about all this and nothing ever comes of it? they arent guaranteed to get it ,0

if to feel people start to play games i stop them mid sentence saying your comments are making me feel uncomfortable would you like to clarify or should we just agree to stop the conversation? its usually the same people so if they hear that enough they tend to stop it takes abut of courage but you are courageous just getting out of bed and facing the day so find that courage to stand up for yourself it builds your strength,0
katie i start by turning off the tv things on it are distressing i do this at 8pm on youtube there is the bible in audio  or you pick something comforting but i just listen to the bible book of psalms is comforting until i am drifting off very important to focus on breathing if having a bad thought mind starts racing when you focus in just your breathing you just drift off,0

suez goturback fleshman i also use cannabis alot personally it started when i was very alone and depressed as a way to help me cope but even now that im much much more happier and healthier it still is a great mood stabilizer and also helps me manage my sleep schedule a lot better getting a solid 8 hours of sleep every night is one of the most important factors to remaining mentally healthy i try to sleep without it but if my mind is racing i know itll level me out and help me go to sleep and i dont have to worry about insomnia becoming a problem that compounds on my other symptoms but with all of this being said everyone is different everyone reacts to different medications differently but cognitive behavior therapy is the one thing that ive experienced is a "one size fits all" type of treatment that works very well,1

please take your meds the side affects are way more detrimental then if you are on your meds stopping cold turkey can cause seizures and a whole array of permanent damage im not trying to scare you but i know how it feels to be zombified and sluggish and tired but you really need to speak with your physch dr and therapist sweety and your bf is also speaking the truth im not being mean im just speaking reality and a long time ago i was constantly on and off my meds it was horrendous and i was a horrible nightmare and train wreck doing that i was constantly in and out of the hospital i was out of control and basically abusive to everyone in my life so please please take your meds otherwise youll be on a darker side youve never been on and medication adjustment takes a while but once your stable trust me you will be thankful and speaking from your bfs side he just doesnt want to see your in pain and hurting yourself and do not give up and give in its not the answer sweety i know its hard and trying but you can do it your journey isnt over and once your in a great place youll look back and realize you have conquered that dark place anyways i hope this helps sweety,1

bp2 gad ptsd insomnia panic disorder agoraphobia recently diagnosed with hashimotos after working 24 years havent worked the past three no disability,1
i have been properly diagnosed and i choose not to be sick because i had allowed myself to be for so long due to my own fears of self stigma you can call it whatever you want to this is my journey and i chosen to call it that while trying to fight for my health and try to get better after after being robbed so much by my illness i choose not to be sick because my bipolar is no longer in control i am! i choose it every fucking day to make my illness that much easier to fight be it making sure on a bad day i walk my dog to making sure i practice self care our illness and there journeys are each different please do not judge my journey because yours is different for someone who had symptoms 19 fucking years to not have any clearly all my work on my health is paying off i for once in my life have not had repeat thoughts of fucking killing myself because i was tired of feeling sick one day! i could not go to school because my symptoms were always on always making my life a mess when i changed my own mind set to it is now i found what works for me,0
they do work for a little while anxiety subsides and generally lift mood downside which docs failed to mention to me extremely addictive and once on them extremely difficult to ever come off i went cold turkey and it was horrendous they have one of the lowest half lifes of all the anti depressantstry going on some forums what i done and you will generally get the same as what im saying ive never felt better since been off them not saying they dont work but it could be a long term commitment once they in your system,0

it would piss me straight off growing up whenever i attempted to talk to my folks about my depression and anxiety i was met with "you just need to work on your relationship with the lord and things will work out" every single time mental health conditions and religion are two separate things so many christians in this country cant see anything without trying to out a jezeus stamp on it grrrrrr,1

you probably have severe anxiety and anxiety can come form anything high stress  or some childhood trama if therapy is going to work you need to be honest with your therapist in order for them to help you you need to be able to except there is a problem in order for you to address it and get some coping strategies also there lot of defrient anxiety med  tracking trigger will make you feel more in control tell your family even as silly as you think it is they will support you and cope better try exercising an order to burn off extra energy from your body be kind with your self one step at a time,1
i know its a completely different situation but this response is more geared towards you my late husband fought cancer for 2 years before he lost we had 2 boys already 10 & 6 and had just found out a week after he had his diagnosis that i was pregnant with our rainbow baby about 8 months before he passed he told me he was ready to go and that was truly the hardest thing ive ever heard that doesnt even describe it i actually got really upset with him because i couldnt understand why he would just give up fighting for us like that i finally understand what he was trying to tell me but i promise you those words still haunt me today if i had any advice for someone thats heard this same thing from someone they love its for you yourself go talk to a dr or in my case dr and social worker therapist asap also try to lean on your personal support system more than i did and just remember to breathe as for him i absolutely agree with what was said above about getting him to a hospital so they can get him feeling better there is absolutely no shame in having to do that!!!! mental illnesses are just as real as things like heart disease and diabetes! i hope some part of this helped my heart and prayers sincerely go out to you and your family if you ever feel like talking please please friend and then message me so ill see it right away!,0

if anyone else wants to try gaba you can order it from "thorne research" i take the "pharma gaba 250" they make a lower dose as well for sleep i take l-tryptophan capsules at bedtime i also take gaba with it puts me to sleep & the next morning im not groggy or hungover feeling gaba is calming if i feel anxious i take 1 or 2 gaba capsules i have xanax at my disposal yet its a good idea to substitute gaba for xanax when possible gaba doesnt make you tired like xanax or other benzos it decreases anxiety though:-),1
i hate the part of "who am i ?" "is this really me?" etc of meds and bad side effects which is why im getting off gapentin and cymbalta ive been on gabapentin for 4 or so years for migraines and possible mood help thats a bitch to get off of cymbalta though pretty easy i have suicidal ideation generalized anxiety disorder panic disorder and psychotic depression w/ manic episodes i dont have much support save for my mother and a few other people but i am currently training a (currently 11w/o) chow/boxer/husky/staffie pit to be a service dog☺ hopefully i can be fully off my meds(minus the birth control) within the next 3 months the doggo is my service puppy in training spencer☺,1
i have just say its day to day things that i struggle with im not sure if its the lamotragine memory issues or more than that but i can genuinely argue for or against whatever it is the person is saying to me and it turns out im completely wrong but id be 100% sure i thought i was right from my memory its really starting to upset me and start questioning everything,0
im sorry for your loss i lost my mum to cancer 10 yrs ago does it get easier? yes and no i had a love hate relationship with my mum and one of my greatest regrets is having an argument with her in hospital and it was the last time she was able to speak there are always times when vulnerable like when i am sick in trouble needing advice etc where it seems worse but then on my good days ill find myself think about good times it will always have an affect on you but its how you choose to remember thats important think about grief counselling it helps,0
find some support groups so you can be around people that can help without depending so much on your friends it sounds like you might be straining your relationships because you depend too much on them keep going you can do this!!,0
i used to love it until they worked their way into crazy manias which got me into trouble or i dropped dramatically into suicidal lows suddenly or i went from manic to paranoid psychotic wondering what reality actually was yeah i had some manias which were just great fun very productive lots of energy creative positive about everything and everyone fun fun fun i did enjoy them a lot havent had a mania for 7 years now due to taking medication and i like stability a lot more the lows which followed were awful and im finally not seeming to have them anymore either (first few years of med no mania but lots of lows) manias were fun but personally i am liking stable a lot more :),1
get out while u can next time ur alone pack all of ur stuff and run this person will only get worse hes playing on ur anxiety and thinks ull never leave a year ago i got out of a relationship just like that one and im so much better off,0

im on paxil after two years of actively trying to get better and trying so many different meds that either did nothing or made me worse it was such a relief to find one that worked everyone is different which is why theres so many different meds out there i havent had any bad side effects with this one unless i miss a day i do horribly mentally for a couple days up to a week if i miss a day i also take a few other meds with it because my brain worms are bastards,1
try not to be afraid you know you need them because they work it will be well worth it when you have children something magical usually happens they consume so much of our time  and our thought process  especially when they are as young as your son revolves mainly on them i dont think you will forget to take care of your sons needs by any means it is clear he is your sunshine i too was anorexic before my first born after i had him it stabilized focus on the long term rewards if you can good luck to you! ,1
i feel stressed out of my mind with this new medicine i just started 4 days ago/: i hate it!,0
i wad the drug addict and the one with mental health problems and with both i was told that i was trying to get even with my dad for leaving us when we were younger that i just wanted attention that there was nothing wrong with me other than trying to get my way its all because mental health scares people in my opinion they dont understand it so they blame the person wroth the disease,0
that is a lot to mix and match without knowing what ur problem is its hard to say if they are overkill i know they all do different things but i would spk to them see if there are better combination drugs or if any are really needed as sometimes u can take 1 that end up helping for a few things and u then dont need the others so much its always worth asking if u are worried they are giving u to many a specially if u get a lot of side effects if ur getting irritable and tired do bring that up as its not worth it i had that with 1 of mine now im on something different its so much better but dont be afraid to voice ur opinion and if u feel u need more support see about a mental health nurse as they see u reg basis i see mine every few weeks and they are so helpful,0
i deal for a jear with high leveloff anxiety my doc tell me take xanax but i have the taken high doses :( and i dont whant it pfff,1

my teenage daughter was prescribed celexa and buspar depression and anxiety,1
i tried running from my crappy childhood and avoid things and people that cause me pain you can separate yourself from those who cause you anxiety however you should get help from a psychiatrist or even a mental health worker i really recommend you go to emergency ward,1
i am sensing a whole different question coming from you than the question about the med being okay i am sensing a question about am i going to be looked at differently because of this medicine? well that medicine is more used for people with bipolar so have you been diagnosed with bipolar? are you willing to talk to tell people you have bipolar? if not then dont worry about it if you dont want people to look at you differently or to think about or know about your mental illness dont share about it i share because i feel it is part of who i am and i am open about who i am and hiding parts of me makes me feel ashamed of those parts but for others they are like "it aint nobodys business" ,0
thanks for asking  cant even describe how intense my depression and anxiety and self hate is so very very strong  very overwhelming  still feel suicidal and hopeless still feel like giving up no matter how i try things wont get better i feel like no one understands  i cant be strong forever the pain hurt and sadness and sorrow and despair is so much to handle  unfortunately i have not had any improvement in how i feel i wish i did thanks a lot for checking in it means a lot that someone cares,0
when youre suicidal youre in the tunnel and its black theres no light at the end of the tunnel and it hurts and its disorienting and scary and you can even hyperventilate to the point at which you become calm because you begin to think youll kill yourself and start developing a plan i think the key is faith and not necessarily in god just faith that just as theres darkness naturally there will be lightness very soon and you can withstand this pain that will definitely release you when the light in the tunnel enters and it will at this point you will breathe better think more clearly and positively and walk away from the black spell you will have missed a bullet and get on with the rest of your day sometimes it really is just an analogy to help your head survive,0
scary veryall above,0
cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness are key treatments in therapy you can look these up on the net and gets some tips on things you can actively do to help yourself since you cant see a psychologist you can get mindfulness apps for your phone to not only practice but to use when you are having an anxiety attack the tools have been a godsend to me,1
seems like they cant find a danm thing to fix me an my anxiety,1
my teen takes remeron (mirtazapine) to sleep our pdoc is also reluctant to prescribe anti-anxiety meds or sleep aids and this was a good compromise she has awful nightmares due to ptsd and severe anxiety she also takes prazosin to help with the nightmares we also use the calm app for sleep but otherwise no screen before bed no tv and were careful about caffeine and sugar in a house full of anxious insomniacs were vigilant parents :),1

you could try to meditate go on youtube and put in guided meditation for bipolar or for anger insomnia anxiety stress any of these things i used to walk away and go and meditate initially up to 8 times a day make sure its guided though and not just the music the breathing is important my personal faves are jason stephenson and the honest guys good luck so hard without meds change doc as soon as you can once your finances are sorted but do not let him win by having self doubt keep your studies up,0
latuda works great for my bipolar depression but i was having this problem in the night that kind of felt like restless legs but it was both my legs and arms and which i ended up with akathisia sorry not sure how to spell it i felt looking at up to give you an exact description of what akathisia is trauma it looks like youre having a seizure in your arms and legs where they felt absolutely horrible and i had to keep walking around and around and around well my arms and legs did these constant movements some kind of nerve disorder i believe is what they say if you know what i mean by restless legs and that you cannot even sit or lay down or even stand in place akathisia is 50 times worse so i would say yes try it if your doctor wants you to but as soon as you start if you start having those weird feelings in your arms and legs i would say stop immediately even though they always want you to wean yourself off and call your doctor immediately good luck!,0
i would exhaust all medication options first i had extra it didnt work and the memory loss is awful i now cant drive long distance as i cant remember directions or follow them i get confused thanks to extra try every other option first,1
alit of psychiatrists are trying to ween ppl off the benzos one reason is bc they have a street value but the biggest reason is bc of the addiction i have been on klonopins for 9 yrs now and its getting to where they arent working like they use to bc my body is use to them but even the with the problems i have my doc refuses to increase bc they have a street value but after a whole year trying to find something for my panic/anxiety disorder and ptsd that has been the only thing that helps and was the last medication i tried even after refusing the xanax i had no idea what klonopin was back then what the doctor tries you out on is what u need to try before the benzos bc benzos can do permanent damage when coming off of them just be honest about whats going on with you and discuss the medication they are offering,1

first of all id be seeing a new doctor there is no such thing as "borderline bipolar" as a diagnosis you either have bipolar 1 or 2 or you have borderline personality disorder second please be honest with your boyfriend if you have been with him for 2 years you shouldnt be keeping that from him- although i am sure he has been through your highs and lows and might have an idea be prepared though for him to possibly be upset that you havent been upfront with him,1
i ache for you its hard because he doesnt understand your desire to stay shuttered in your down time and you cant easily force yourself to go out my wife of 26 years wants nothing more than to sit home and watch movies living life vicariously because of severe social anxiety weve come to a compromise i have recently discovered an interest in theater so thats my outlet and her love of movies and theater gives her the opportunity to get out and come see what im doing,0

suicide for those left behind is never ok suicide for those contemplating it is one of the most painful and selfless decisions its never about us it is all about that one person not being able to see straight not being able to see through their emotional distress their broken heart their pleas for help that seem to be falling on deaf ears instead of counting how many we have losthow about counting how many times one has picked up that pill bottle or held that rope?! we and i speak for myself cant look past the next 30 secondsand know that it will be painful but living is not impossible we cant take back and undo once we have died life goes on but without us in it thank you for reaching out to us for trusting people that you dont know i am one of many that you can talk with i only know my own demons but will hear you with all that i have i cant save the world but if you want to talk you will have my undivided attention im sarcastic and sharp tongued but also kind and compassionate you matter xxx,0
it can take a while to find the right meds balance that suits you it took me a couple of years i would highly recommend though you dont stop taking your medication you have a serious mental health condition that can cause you to attempt suicide please go back to your consultant and speak to them as for your boyfriend he may be scared of the consequences of you stopping your meds good luck xx,1

im in liverpool its taken me 15 years for me for anyone to take me seriously i have been constantly mis diagnosed by my gp since 2005 i have been told over and over again i was suffering with post natal depression as i a mother of 6 i knew dam well it wasnt anyway one day i broke down infront of a new gp and begged for help i got a feferal to broad oak mental health hospital i had an assessment there and they knew straight away i had borderline and possible bipolar i thought oh great i will at least be treated now how wrong was i!! i was then told i will have to see a clinic psychologist who could prescribe me mood stabilizers and anti psychotics which i desperately need and that was over 6 weeks ago and i still have had no appointment through to see anyone i was also promised an intensive course of cbt and /or dbt and again  ive heard nothing i have rang every week telling them im desperate and i need my meds now and they just say wait for your appointments to come through its a complete joke!!!! god forbid what could happen in the mean time its virtually impossible to get help in the uk,0
let me first say that i think its awesome that youre reaching out to see how best to handle this situation and the love that shows you have for your fiancee i have been with my husband for 15 years now married for nine of them the best advice he would give is never minimize or make fun of the way shes feeling something bipolar people in general feel things more intensely people in the hypomanic (bipolar 1) spectrum feel things even more deeply we are prone to be more angry fearful and hurtful to those closest to us in my case i would constantly question why anyone would want to be with me do not take this as a personal attack against you it is more indicative of how we feel about ourselves gently make sure she is taking care of herself--meds proper rest proper eating etc when im in a depressive low my husband has to remind to shower read and educate yourself on the disorder triggers and symptoms so you can help see if a cycle is happening even if she gets angry with you do it anyway most importantly remember that she is a person not a mental illness and thats who you fell in love with in the first place good luck to you both ,0
this is a core question many ask in the depths of their illness the curse is that whilst the illness is real for the sufferer the reality of the actual world may not be as desperate it does not help that we are surrounded by such a negative media only reporting the bad stuff of life and the world we live in why do public sector broadcasters in the uk or usa not broadcast positive news the uks biggest supporter of those experiencing suicidal feelings - samaratins - would argue that providing time and space for people with such feelings to talk unjudged and explore them can bring new perspective and outlook to move away from the deepest darkest thoughts unfortunately for a very few no relief can be found and suicide provides the ultimate escape from the pain reducing the stigma and taboo that still persists on brain illness needs to be tackled in the uk the nhs does not provide the necessary preventative public health work because the government will not find in this area which is the biggest single health issue affecting us socially and economically as a populace we remain in denial out of fear to open up about this many face their daily struggles in silence and isolation there are alternatives - dare we fight for them?,0
sleep is a natural response todepression and anxiety - do not feel guilty - just do it,1
i was in that situation before and it took me over a year to get out of it it was tricky because we also worked in the same place until he forced me to quit i constantly was worried he was cheating because he had in the past and things got really bad in the end i eventually just left him in the middle of the night the first few weeks were really hard but after that things did get some better you can do this! if you need someone to talk/vent to im here! ~lost and forgotten,1
im struggling today thank you for this,0
i gained 35 kgs in 6 months also & now i have social anxiety as well,1
thank you jodie my daughter suffers from depression as does my daughter in law my son suffers from schizoaffective/anxiety he is actually looking at getting one also i was diagnosed 7 years ago when i was 42 its been a battle and some days it still is,1
one of my cats is called ember too but people call her amber which is not the same even on her passport it is spelt amber i was too shy to tell them to fix it i call her beenie now,0
sounds like u have a mood disorder of some sorts and anxiety issues bit that can only be diagnosed by a professional so my advice would be to see a psychiatrist no they r not gonna take ur kids away because u suffer from depression and anxiety! that just doesnt happen so dont worry about that seek help from ur local county social services or psychiatric clinic good luck always rememver the setting sun is a promise for tomorrow ,1
the struggle is real! were survivors and fighters to face the mirror and still do what we gotta do,0
i know exactly what you are going through my gf/fiancée of 16 years left me 2 weeks and 1 day ago  the heartache and the hurt is so unbearable that i cant handle it or stand it  i thought for sure i finally found the one that i could be with forever  she will and always be the love of my life i still love her and care about her and worry about  i miss her so much and love her so much that its killing me inside  we both have a mental illness / illnesses  it seems as the days go bye it gets harder and harder to live without her ,0
do you have any medication to take for anxiety? maybe that might help in this circumstance,1
catherine lara so true!! i understand the struggle and i want you to know no matter what youll always have your favorite human by your side! ;) ❤️,0
instead of telling someone that if theyre suicidal they need to seek out help we should actually be aggressively showing these people that we care a truly depressed and suicidal person does not want to ask for help the whole problem is that they feel like a burden the thought of asking for help is out of the question theres too much risk from their perspective no one believed me when i said i was sick when i reached out to people they said i was actually just lazy and selfish and a slob or faking it for attention and in my mind reaching out meant that someone might tell me i was all these things again and in those moments i wasnt strong enough to handle that so it was safer to not ask for help its backwards and thats because depression is not logical or reasonable if you see that someone you care about is suicidal you go out of your way to show them that you care and that you want them there dont tell them your friends and family will be sad tell them you will be sad and want to do anything even something small that might prove that you care go to them physically call them and talk to them leaving it up to them to ask for help wont work,0
im not alone in my ant phobia???,0
there is hope you can change your life but you have to stop believing their world stops because of you although im sure you are important the world will not stop turning because you leave i had a nervous breakdown feeling like this and the reality hit me when while i was hospitalized guess what? my kid survived my husband stepped up and dang if no one starved or died without me we put way more pressure on ourselves boxing ourselves into these roles we create this sense of panic and fear that stems more from our illness than from actual truth learn to say enough is enough and dont be afraid to ask for help their world is better because youre in it but it wont stop if you need your time too,0
i recently completed a 6 week treatment of tms for my depression and has worked wonders i completed the treatments about 2 months ago and havent been on medications except for my anxiety meds since almost the first treatment,1
itll be a struggle every day make sure you give her space when she needs it but not too much show her you care even when it seems like she hates your guts because she doesnt its just her brain making her act that way let her be open with how shes feeling without judgement my ex was able to tell my mood was changing before i did and he would get me to talk about what was going on in my brain and sometimes it would stop or at least make the swing less intense let her know that on bad nights she can wake u up because she needs a hug and to be held and told how strong she is for waking up everyday to do everything over again if shes too depressed to get out of bed to clean or eat bring her food in bed and clean for her little things can mean a lot more than you think when ur swinging back and forth,0
i personally have never struggled with bad acne but ive had friends who have and could never find a solution i love natural products and making my own things ive used it as body wash and a good many of my friends use it and love it all different ages and skin types each ingredient has a purpose and ive even shaved my face chest and legs to test it for women and to see how well it worked on freshly shaven faces chests legs etc heres my recipe for a great face wash coffee grounds brown sugar coconut oil baking soda cucumbers oat meal honey tea leaves tea tree oil lemon juice zinc melatonin sea salt cinnamon pm me if you have any questions as to what each thing does or any questions at all bananas,0
im on it as needed only 25mgs it seems to help on days when i feel really anxious i can take it up to 3 times a day and if one 25mg doesnt work i can take another adding up to 50mg and it seems to do the trick,0
omgim so glad you guys are ok or at least still fighting! i was so worried about you i saw your post last week and was terrified for you and your child i felt completely helpless im glad you followed through and did go in like you said you would but i am still very concerned about you please dont give up you have perfect strangers caring about you so you must try to care about yourself you can pm any time you want to talk i know this is the crazy leading the crazy but the crazies are the only ones that understand lol please hang in there also continue to be a good mom continue to take good care of your child you are both special❤,0
googling or webmding will give you pill anxiety if you read to much,1
let them see you at your worst dont worry about how you look unkempt is good let your anxiety show if you feel like crying cry presumably you will be seeing a mental health professional so any diagnosis beyond anxiety and depression can only help your application good luck,1
i completely agree as someone who has made attempts on their own life after suffering for years with depression and a fairly recent diagnoses of bpd  the one thing that winds me up in that situation is how everybody tells you how they would feel if you did it guilt you and tell you they are angry yet the person suffering isnt doing it for nothing they need support,0
2 without a doubt ,0
i get panic attacks while driving some times if its a place i drive to a lot i know places i can pull over to calm myself down try some type of distractions music,0

i have about 7 years of success with zyprexa for bipolar for anxiety for insomnia (to some degree i black out for 5 hours during which im said to be sleeping then up and down almost every hour since going back on the ambien too 10mg of zyprexa isnt touching my insomnia),0
i waited until i was almost 29 to finally try anxiety medication - i really wish i had tried sooner!!! you might want to consider it especially in combination with therapy thats what has helped me so immensely,1
i was given it once and i am well old now so do not judge everyone to need your way out in deep depression you may not be able to accept another to lean on there is many ways and yes people survive other have not arguments like your instigating cause stress so you are causing grief here unnecessary through your misinterpretation the main teenager maybe brighter and more able now enough,1
ashley hazel wallberg snarr please look after urself dont get too stressed things may get better even if you get back together ie if he gets help or changes his mind on things or it cud be fine if you stay separate main thing is look after urself try stay calm do activities exercise things you enjoy try stay positive things change so much in life in a short they get worse then get better x,0
i had really bad anxiety on abilify it also made me have really messed up nightmares,1
latuda had a terrible effect on me i felt shaky but like a zombie at the same time almost like a bouncy ball stuck in a glass cup i couldnt function or let alone drive on it everyone reacts differently though id say try it out for a few weeks if you can and then talk to your doctor i have found that the first few weeks of taking a new medication has always been difficult because of the initial side effects,0
you got this dont be afraid we are here for you and we love you,0
im on efexor xr 375mg i take 150mg in the morning 75mg at lunch and 150mg at night plus im on clonazapam and epilum but we will leave them out for now efexor i have split doses because i get the brain zaps it feels like your brain is being zapped and it kinda travels down your body and feels like your eyes are shaking the split had kinda helped but not really i sweat so bad sometimes that people ask me if im ok at work and wake up in a pool of sweat ive been on it for about 7 years and scared to come off as ive heard its horrible i also get severe gastrointestinal issues ive only really had them since efexor the nausea might be to do with that i have ibs had gallstones and gord (reflux) something to be mindful of i hope it works for you as it does work for a lot of people,0
i woz diagnosed at 47 49 now have been hosp for 8 weeks due to a anxiety and depression,1
i was taking 225mg daily but i hated the side effects especially the excessive sweating! i weaned myself off it eventually but even that was horrible its a very toxic drug in my opinion,0
im currently struggling to sleep because of my anxiety ive tried to distract myself by watching things and when i switch it off to try and sleep my anxiety comes back and hits me in the face any advice??? ,1
even though i have had professionals tell me i am a very strong person i still consider myself weak when im smiling im usually pretending because i dont want to make others uncomfortable i have missed too many events in my families lives to count because i couldnt put that pretend smile on my biggest regret was not being in my nephews lives i do cry in private at times but for the most part the tears wont come and i internalize my hurt i fight many battles that i keep to myself,0
i was dignosed bi polar with bpd 10 years ago now i have not been able to find medication that didnt make me feel like doing self harm i gave up on psychs and therapists and trying to figure out meds i try to manage my mental health myself i struggle on a daily basis i do not recommend this path to anyone,1
i feel for all of you i have had separation anxiety depression and bipolar ii since i was very young of course face in the late 60s 70s and early 80s drs were just figuring out what depression was i have been on every medication that they have come up with i had a fairly good luck with lexapro i have major panic attacks often i now on 20mg of trintelex i do a lot of sleep hypnosis havent been able to work and for some reason i can get ss disability,1
the only problem i have is when im randomly put on a grave yard shift that means i cant take my meds as they make me so tired i have 2 kids and cant just catch up on my sleep and end up with anxiety and not being able to sleep from not taking my meds being able to have a stable and normal shift all week makes my week 100x better than it would have if all shifts were different and there were random graves,1
i fought against meds for so long not really cuz of the stigma but because i get addicted to things very easy and i worried i wouldnt be able to live off them then i started to have massive panic attacks several times a day and my husband begged me to please talk to the doctor about meds so i started zoloft i got damn lucky zoloft worked for me right away i went on zoloft mainly because i was trying to get pregnant and its safe for pregnancy i was very lucky they worked and make me stable,1
im not ashamed of mine however i choose not to talk about it as openly as i have in the past because i believe it scares people & pushes them away learned that the hard way (no true friends) pushed everyone away i only have my immediate family now & im completely fine with that they understand me & actually care someday ill have a friend who truly cares until then im good! ill occasionally mention my mental illnesses but only to empathize with others so they know they are not alone im me thats all i can be no more no less just perfectly me ,0
and when you have anxiety panic attacks recycle complete meltdown looking from the outside-in and nothing you can do about get out of the area and then get calm down the best way you can without hurting yourself or others,1
my daughter has an alarm in her phone i just have mine in my bedside table and it is the first thing i do when i wake up,0
this is so true i have been dreading mornings lately,0
i lost my mum from suicide in march  its the hardest thing ever to deal with  i am still and will be struggling for such a long time  i miss her and wish i could have told her how much she meant to be before she took her own life my heart breaks over and over,0
guilt is such a huge struggle for many of us i carry it around every day and its exhausting but its so hard to let go of i can feel your pain just for reading your post the fact - that you think about it makes you a great mom we just have a hard time forgiving ourselves at least i do,0
yes i am going through this i have gained 100 pounds in just a few months from medications that make me hungry and depression because the pills arent helping me so i dont care what i eat im trying to get control and trying different meds thats one reason mental health problems suck so many drugs they put you on then there are new side effects and its just a never ending circle ive also developed poly neuropathy im sad i let my body go but depression makes you not care you will eventually find something that has less side effects dont be upset about your weight it will come off please stay positive about yourself ,1
it does get easier well not easier but it makes you stronger because you learn to adapt and somewhat control your thoughts and emotions being on medication is not a bad thing this is how i look at it i have to take medication to give me control of some sort that gets me through my day and helps me thats the only person it is ever about!!!! you!!! you can not make anyone happy until you can make you happy! if you have to use medication to give you that but if control thats fine and if you can learn to do it without medication thats fine too find what makes you happy dont wish what others say or think because although i dont know your story and thats fine people who will criticize you or tell you thats not what tou need i can almost guarantee you they dont understand comprehend or have the slightest idea of what you go through everyday nor could they even begin to understand a portion of what goes on each and every day hang in there you are a survivor!!!! good luck and best wishes!!! i hope that i have helped even just a little and i hope you stick it out there and keep pushing and hopefully you will see there is truth to what i am telling you! speak positive on yourself! you have purpose and so many things to live for!! you are young and overwhelmed and tired but your life is really just getting started a career a soul mate kids neices and nephews if you have siblings but most importantly you make it through! you learn control as it goes on im not saying its easy because its not but you have to reach down deep inside yourself and find that fighter that fighter thats going to gain control and stability and someone who is enjoying life instead of being miserable in it! find the good things the things that are important to you! because thats where the healing process starts is with you!!!! good luck! hopefully i see and update from you shortly! you can do this! just believe in your heart that its possibly to get better and feel better! i embrace my mental illnesses because i have done research to learn what i can about them and i am just trying to live my life one day at a time accomplishing something i struggle with to prove to myself i have more control today than i did yesterday!!! i used to be so embarassed for anyone to know that i suffer with bipolar disorder or anxiety or depression or ptsd but this is my life and my life depends on me! my lidenis what i make of it! thus what i am saying to you! it is what you make it! you can overcome this if you want to you can gain control and live a great and prosperous life! its all on what you want from life dont overwhelm yourself though take tiny steps to help you reach your milestones! i am confident that you will make the right decision and at least try you can gain control you just have to want it you have to want a better life and want a way to stop the suicidal ideations the depression the anxiety it will happen!!! just dont give up! because as you get older you will look back on these times and be grateful for the experiences you want through because of the person it makes you! i love what i have been through its not the easiest to talk about not does it make me feel the best but i am thankful for going through what i did because i learned so much and i am proudof the person i am and the person i am becoming i am a mother aunt sister wife of a happy husband daughter granddaughter friend my family doesnt always understand me and thats ok because sometimes i dont understand myself and thats ok too but dont let little things like that bring you down keeep on fighting! keep pushing! dont expect every day to be the same accept the fact you will still have your bad days but hopefully you gain the knowledge to accept the bad days push through them and prepare for a better tomorrow!!!!,0
i smoke cannabis oil and it will help being manic symptoms down like rapid heart beat racing thoughts anxiety the urge to constantly be doing something it really helps prevent manic episodes,1
i hate meds myself and would prefer more natural methods however ive come to realize that not every illness can be managed this way and i need to take pharmaceuticals some meds are necessary in order for us to have even a small quality of life in our day even if we dont want to take them or dont think they help if you dont think they are helping though id definitely consult with your doctor and pharmacist as well about possibly changing them up remember though any changes of meds comes with an adjustment phase that can sometimes be rough i know you are worried about your partner but you need to be a bit selfish and focus on you its very hard to know how much you are dealing with when you are stressed or focused on the concerns of others,0
as many have stated take a deep breath pharmacies can get you in touch with companies that will either get you samples or coupons for discounts if you have a costco in your area they have the best discount program and good prices but check with your state mental health website it should give you links to the counties where you can get free care it will take time to qualify for the aca your area or any state benefits i have been where you are i have slogged through the system and know what to do after 39 years of trial and error it can be very frightening but do not go off your meds!! pm me and i would me happy to walk you through what needs to be done hang in there!!,1
im not afraid to hit an old man,0
best way i have found to remember to take my meds is to get get a box with the am/pm if needed and to put a alarm on your phone something most people keep on them at all times now days that way when you get the alarm you remember to either take your meds if you havent or check to see if you have and since you have the convienant box you know if you have or not,1
wow you sound a lot like the church counselor who told me that the reason i have depression and anxiety and am suicidal is because i was doing things god didnt want me to do fuck off for real,1
id like to say it means he isnt the one i had a relationship like that i felt guilty for wanting to stay home always and didnt want to bore my gf you just gotta find people and friends who take care of those quirks you have regardless of the mental disorder youre a human and have rights to your feelings,0
yes it helps tremendously! however my state oklahoma is extremely rigid with itso i do what anybody else does,1
music does show to help! singing as well! i did so much better when i sung in a choir one thing i have discovered is that silence is a horrible thing for me and music touches my soul,0
i had 9 rounds over 35 weeks two years ago it saved my life i have some trouble recalling words i need when im anxious but other than that i have no negative effects without ect i wouldnt be able to be at university now as bipolar had effected my cognitive ability badly - ect reversed that i will definitely go back for more if i go downhill again research shows that ect has an 80% success rate; that is 80% of patients show significant improvement ultimately it is your decision dont be pushed one way or another only you can decide,0
i am 18 weeks pregnant no meds  great support system and great drs!!!! i def see the difference of no medication and i really cant wait to go back on it i am functioning fine but the struggle is real and with medication i had no fight anymore !! i was on the right amount the right ones !!!,1

set an alarm for the time to take your meds even though its something we do every single day we can still forget,0
my dog helps a lot hes not a registered support animal or anything but he definitely helps ive also found some of the most random things that help like listening to an audiobook of harry potter helps or i found out that fantastic beasts audiobook really helped because for whatever reason the tone of eddie redmaynes voice is incredibly calming to me (who knew that would be a thing ha) but in all seriousness animals are the best for anxiety,1
paranoia has become one of my senses having been paranoid all my life shit even with medication it doesnt even slow down,0
i take gabapentin mainly for bi polar and helps bone spurs in my back thats a plus i would change your time on kolonopin deffinatly can get you a dui if you have to go somewhere take it when you get back if it has a strong effect i take seroquel threw out the day doesnt effect anything cause my anxiety is so high,1
most people think im just faking my bipolar to get attention or as an excuse for my "weakness" its difficult to ignore them even if i try to not care anymore i have to face them at work with family and friends (or "friends") im afraid to become sort of an hermit,0
ive been fired for being in hospital with kidney stones and having a week off ive also been let go for having a panic attack induced by trauma i didnt know i had in both cases the employer didnt care enough to say get yourself better take their concern as a gift and use that gift to work on your mental health,1
omg this has been happening to me too! my dr thought it was part of the anxiety and then it got worse and i was diagnosed with esophagitis,1
bonnie corbin what you said to her is absolutely horrible no two people have the history or personal level of any mental disorder and too suggest otherwise only shows that you truly know nothing or truly dont understand mental illness to say what you insinuated on this page is horrible,0
depression and anxiety is hell to live with sometimes i hope your daughter is doing well with hers it took a good friend of mine a lot of nagging and nudging before i finally sought help :),1
if he treats you and the kids good then dont worry about getting married its how he supports you and the kids that is most important,0
astronomy! thats the word i also get my words confused also good point about not being able to see the stars when theres a storm seemed to have forgotten that too im a mess!,1
my daughter was just on it she is 17 with bpd anxiety depression and adhd this med aggravated the depression and made it worseso she went back on ritalin,1
i would maybe travel so that you can get away from your home stress and relax maybe take a close family member or friend with you it will help clear your mind- plus it sounds like you deserve to treat yourself,1
i have the same - bipolar and pretty bad generalized anxiety disorder i have no idea about a free dbt app but having mint and dark chocolate m&ms with me to eat can help bring me out/keep me from an anxiety attack,1
therapy helps sometimes you may go through a few therapists til you find the right fit for you i only take 20mg of lamictal and 10mg of nortriptyline which im prescribed for a nerve in my face but it also works for depression which i have severely right now it is at bay which im greatful for if you believe in god you can talk to him that has helped me alot but everyone is different i have social anxiety but not taking anything for it right now,1
i used to have severe panic attacks about my mother dying before i was put on meds i wrote down a list of things i wanted to imagine instead: what would my life be like if i had the power to shapeshift? what would i do if i met the avengers and loki? what situation would cause me to meet these people? same as above but with a celebrity i liked if i was a villain what would i be after? what if i had control of fire and ice? imagine owning a team of six sports dogs what breeds and what sports would i like?,0
first: i know exactly what i get i dont need you trying to explain it second: this post specifically says anxiety attacks maybe read first before trying to look down on me,1
well getting in the practice of a mindful life very difficult imo esp for people who struggle w mental illness we tend to feel out of control and over reactive so practicing staying in the present is quite challenging becoming a master self control is daunting least it was for me,0
wow do i understand this i know what its like to be bipolar with manic depression and anger issues that was wrong for him to push you to get to that point after two years he should know that stop means stop not just for your health but because its not good on either one of you for you to get that upset i know when im angry i dont always think through what im saying and have been known to say things that hurt not meaning too im just going to throw this out there if you ever need anyone to talk to message me i will gladly be the ear that you need with nobody else will,0
im currently on zoloft and its also my first medication so far ive noticed it helping my anxiety but having some breakthrough depression (can cry sometimes for no reason) ive had minimal side effects with it so im going to stick with it in hopes it works for me,1
lovely and in prision for what ???? i suffer with depression anxiety but it dont make me do bad things to end up in jail and cry i hav mental illness,1
i definitely find it to alot worse when i start/am unstable i have to clean the house top to bottom and throw out a heap of things it almost feels like a cleansing and it feels like its the only thing left that i have control of im very particular about where things are put in my pantry how my food is cut and cooked how the toilet is cleaned etc however in saying that when things are really bad its only a few of those things that i cant let go of everything else goes to shit because i can barely make it off the couch however my mind is still racing and its difficult to get any real sleep so hard to explain because i cant understand it myself i have bipolar 2 anxiety and ocd lucky me lol,0
go see panic! in concert?,0
a piece of advice i was given by my grandfather that always held true was 99% of what you worry about never happens if you can just try to go by that your thoughts should start to settle down,0
i was worried when i first found out i quit zoloft cold turkey too and they made me go back on it they told me thats the first thing they normally put pregnant women on like i said they watched over me and i had a lot more appointments but she came out happy and healthy!!,0
i understand except with me my best friend is the one with the problems she blames me for everything and lashes out at me and lies all the time she has borderline disorder and schizophrenia so i know its not her fault but it still hurts and people left me because i complained too much and had too many problems as someone who has aspergers anxiety and depression so i understand what you are going through,0
when ever i get into that rage/irritation mode all i can feel is anger i dont feel anything but anger no fear or anything else i plan on staying on my meds just hoping i can get off the depakote i really really dont like the weight i have gained,0
my doctors told me that ssris are bad for my hypomania im on latuda(helps) valium and neurontin for panic/anxiety (helps) and seroquel (hate it) for sleep the seroquel puts me to sleep for maybe 2 hours and then i wake up and eat everything in sight,1
psychosis can manifest in extreme maniatrust me i knowive had a few psychotic episodes where i was extremely paranoid and delusionalhe needs help but he needs to want to get help,1
yep and i truly dont care right now ill be 42 in a few weeks never married no kids but ive decided to only focus on me and having a baby myself (thru an iui with an a anonymous sperm donor) im not giving up on becoming a mom due to not being able to find a "good man" i feel that my bipolar is not to blame the only way in which i can remotely see its role is that i am very "all or nothing" and also i trust nobody and will go to great lengths to make sure my man isnt lying or cheating on me so i can become obsessed with that and am an amazing natural at playing detective i have had tons of past serious relationships but sure enough my instincts were always right on and id catch them in huge lies all the time (and some cheating!!),0
me too i had a hystectomy in 2002 and a full thyroidectomy in 2008 thats a double whammy in the mood department throw in the depression anxiety plus ptsd and some health issuesbut then i got on wellbutrin 300 mg and when my thyroid levels are perfect my boyfriend loves it its like when we met 14 years ago lol my doc says wellbutrin is the "it" med in the right dose for getting the mojo back for some folks,1
im on 15mg of abilify i have higher blood pressure and increased sweating and have gained half a stone in 3 months but its the best one ive had at stabilising me x,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page never assume its only one person that is damaged,1
i am the mother of two adult children emma peetz who has given you wise counsel in her reply is one until tecently the mental illness of my youngest daughter was so debilitating i was her carer for far too many years fortunately emmas bipolar isnt so severe she has ever needed a carer and works and support s herself and cares for her son who is now a teenager i am an advocate for carers and mental illness in sydney and recently addressed a conference on the subjects i will wuote you a couple of relevannt parts of what i had to say as it may help you "medication can usually quickly relieve physical suffering but relieving the suffering of mental illness can take years" during that time she was hospitalized many times and various medications were tried by caring and wonderful clinicians the current medications have worked and at 31 she can actually look forward to a fulfilling life and is now an advocate for the mentally ill i wrote her a poem which said in part "she sank to the depths of despair as her soul surrendered to the gods the demons and the shadow people that lived in the fires of her wounded mind" i can only encourage you to follow the advice of expert clinicians as i was able to finish the poem for my daughter with: "hercgentle spirit endured strong enough to come into her light once morewhe but still tremlinng with fear for she had seen the dark side of the mind " there was an australian poet who suffered from your illness who also wrote a poem which finishes: "and the world my girl is a good world after all"am sure you too can come to that place but it may take many wise minds and no doubt the right meds for you to get to that place,1
ive gone from chronic depression with anxiety to bipolar severe mixed over 28 years my life just seems to get harder and harder hospitalizations legal interventions partial hospitalizations therapy psychiatristsi live the stereotypes and myths of mental illness every single goddamn day and it hurts so badly i have no one left in my life except my loving and accepting sons who keep me going and i love so dearly they are the only positives left everyone else lies to me judges dismisses and wants nothing to do with me i have to fight for everything in my life and i am exhausted and do not trust anyone anymore this is a horrible degrading expensive disease that literally has l ruined me and left me with little hope or happiness im crying now my life is worthless ive never been stable just get worse and worse if people only could feel the hate and indifference that is so intolerable that i want to die,0
go on the internet increases my anxiety,1
zoloft made me have suicidal thoughts and actions my doctor stopped it right away and i felt better almost immediately maybe talk to your doctor about stopping it? from what ive heard from some psychiatrists most individuals with bipolar disorder should not be put on antidepressants because they could make mania worse or trigger lowest of lows but hey im not a doctor that is just what ive hear from doctors whilst in treatment centers also i dont know exactly what your bipolar disorder experience is like its different for all of us right now you have two people to think about your unborn child which god bless him or her needs to be taken care of before and after birth and then there is you the primary part of the puzzle i say the primary part because without you being in right mind mentally it will affect you physically which in turn will god forbid affect that beautiful child as i write this i am trying to hold back tears because although i am not a mother i one day want to be one and what you are now going through i fear i will with my countless amounts of medications and questioning each day if i will be mentally stable enough or if my baby will be affect if i take meds but what you need to have right now and what ill need to have in the future is faith yes talk to your doctor about possibly getting off the zoloft because maybe its causing those bad thoughts and do the technical psychiatric part of the process but like they say there is science and then there is god i encourage you if you are a praying woman to pray on it especially when you get those thoughts he will listen do it for you do it for that blessed child all will be alright i promise you may god bless you both and your family take care love❤️ ,1
i might have to disagree with this one depression is terrible and no one will argue that and until i got my diagnoses medication and subsequently my worst hypomanic episode yet i never would have said this depression taught me exactly what i am afraid of and the mania has me face those "fears" without a second thought i spent so many years hating the world and everything about myself that now i can turn even the worst of things into a joke and rarely let it bother me i even attribute a decent about of my life success to depression all i ever thought was "things have to get better this cant be how life always is" so i just kept moving forward i tell everyone im crazy i have no shame,0
i worry about this too,0
i did not realize i was bp ii until age 40 when full blown hypomania hit me i need mood stablizers for hypomania and anti-depressant for anxietybut i have gotten my life back and may be even become a nicer person in that i am no longer doing mental and emotional gymnastic just do ordinary thingsin the end if you need meds they will likely improve your quality of life,0
in addition people with bpd quite often have a weak self concept they dont always know who they really are deep down inside they may always feel like theres something missing or something wrong with them intrinsically this can cause periods of dissociation and difficulty in maintaining a healthy sense of self esteem they may have a weak value system (or one that is missing entirely) or find that they have a difficult time adhering to whatever value system they do have since theres a real issue with trusting and black/white thinking they dont always trust in their own decisions and may do things to get people to "like" them or not leave them that would be against their value system normally and think that they (themselves) are terrible/bad/evil people for doing it later they often take their mistakes in life much more seriously than other people a "normal" person may make the same mistake and feel bad about it but its unlikely that they will see themselves as terrible/bad/evil for having made the mistake oftentimes a person with bpd would make that mistake and internalize it as a personal failurethat it happened because they (themselves) are awful/bad/wrong this means that their self concept is much more fluid than "normal" people now please keep in mind that not all bpd sufferers have every single one of these symptoms there are definitely other symptoms that can be included in the diagnosis but this is a pretty good start and the most common symptoms sufferers may face people with bpd need intense therapy because they must change how they see themselves and the world around them (having a more mature realistic viewpoint of the world that isnt all black or all white) rebuild value systems and self concepts that may be missing/aberrant build the ability to trust others/self and learn coping mechanisms dbt (dialectic behavioral therapy) was developed for bpd sufferers initially and has shown some positive results for sufferers who adhere to the techniques in their lives heres the thing too its fairly common for bipolar and bpd to be comorbid in a person (meaning they have both at the same time) we dont necessarily know if theres a genetic link between them but we are beginning to think thats possible a person suffering from both at the same time (untreated) would tend to be extremely emotional moody hypersensitive to criticism untrusting self-damaging with highs and lows in behavior that make their lives (and the lives of those who love them) quite difficult they are chaotic because their brain isnt working correctly due to chemical imbalances and at the same time their perception of themselves other people and the world is one based on distrust and fear of being abandoned or rejected they tend to have problems with love relationships friendships family relationships and relationships with coworkers quite often they end up being in the hospital for suicidal ideations or for mania (more often for depression than mania) its not uncommon for them to end up in the system for some time before they get a proper and correct diagnosis (and a good treatment plan) they may get kicked out of the system early with a misdiagnosis which leads to poor management of symptoms and relapsing,0
well i had such a horrible feeling today so anxious but i remembered what you wrote and guess what i feel so much better sure tomorrow will be more positive,0
i cant really tell if its working or not to tell you the truth im on 3 other meds for anxiety i can tell those work,1
ive been on setraline for almost a year and had no side effects when i started but ive recently gone up to 100mg and im getting the worst brain zaps but they are helping so i just work through it i have depression anxiety and traits of borderline personality disorder and they seem to be working for me :),1

thats a shame here in oz you can go through a chemist etc a be hooked up for overnight study at home i have severe apnea and had no choice and had to get a loan for the machine,0
guilt trips make you feel like more of a worthless loser calling me selfish doesnt help,0
cbt has never helped me i have had more positive results from ct/rt or emdr therapy cbt is more or less a "one size fits all" type therapy and is only effective for anxiety and depression (even though it did not help me very much) explore some other therapies and find which one will benefit and address your most prominent mental issues before committing to a therapy,1
yes it does help in small amounts though and only used when expiriencing high levels of anxiety or depression its not good to use it all the time because it will loose its effect after a while and actually do damage and can also create paranoia,1
i know exactly where youre coming from i fight it everyday its a struggle but im fighting it and im going to win so can you good luck,0
also do you exercise ? i found that to help so so much with my anxiety and depression and even my mood swing from my personality disorder i stopped taking meds completely for 13 months due to the seroquel giving me memory loss and a stutter and i felt 100x better than i ever did on meds i started taking a multi vitamin and exercising daily and i was feeling great the only reason im back on mertazapine is to help me sleep because i have really bad insomnia but it also helps majorly with my anxiety so if i feel anxious i wil take a med that day and be better i dont take them every day,1
no zeprexa wont kick the anxiety have you tried busbar? or hydroxyzine? if your anxiety is as bad as mine like "social anxiety" phobias fears not wanting to leave the house due to you just plain freaking out you really need a benzodiazepine,1
would you look at that another phobia to top my existing ones ,0
i take lexapro for my depression/anxiety only side effects i have are the bad days when i forget to take it,1
exactly i fear not being on meds it took many many years to find the right ones but now i know how good i can be with the help of my meds and counseling i never ever want to go back to depression,1
its funny how the mentally ill are on the front lines so to speak to battle the stigma of mental illness isnt it? your comment resonated with me in that sense its definitely a hard struggle to say the least but we must keep on fighting every day,0
you need to prioritize your physical safety give what support you can from a safe distance or with a group of friends mental illness is a reason for his behavior but not an excuse: dont let yourself be injured or threatened,0

it happens to me all the time i shake all over legs hands and head basically head to toe i feel it coming on and then struggle to get it to stop try clearing your mind although i know its hard to then take slow deep breathes and try to relax this has helped me,0
some people though they seem like forever friends really arent they are just those ones who sadly pass through our lives i am horrible at keeping in contact with long distance friends most of the time because i rarely reach out on my own but if someone messages or i manage to call someone we talk for ages life gets hectic but if she wont contact you back then shes not worth it you already did the easy part i understand the fear of abandonment i have severe abandonment and sometimes its hard to really understand that very few people are an actual constant in your life i rely on animals and my immediate family for consistency,0
it do cause digestive problems when i get depressed and anxious i loose appetite i have lost 23 kg in two to three months my meds work just for few days then no effect i also immagine getting worse disease  yesterday was hell,1

im going through the process of trying to get disability because i suffer from bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder ptsd major depression add panic anxiety disorder i havent had my hearing yet so i dont know what the outcome is going to be but my chances look good i find that taking baths is very soothing and helps calm the mind i also use symphony music or some type of relaxation music when i feel an anxiety attack coming on breathing techniques sometimes work in through your nose and out through your mouth very slowly sometimes just taking a walk and changing your atmosphere will change the thoughts in your head to help you get over the anxiety i also have a fear of leaving the house so that its hard for me to do even if its only to go to the corner and back try to get out of the house as much as you can i also suffer from flashbacks and nightmares melatonin is a natural sleep medication that might help you at night time i hope you can get your insurance soon and get to a psychiatrist to prescribed some pharmaceuticals to help you with your symptoms good luck to you if you ever need to talk i will be here to listen talk therapy is also helpful to me,1

i think it depends on your history with driving if you got in a bad accident you may have ptsd due to it (which case therapy would be a good remedy) if you are a new driver it is normal to feel anxious i dont know if people have medications just for driving,0
horrible experience,0
medication doesnt feel fine medication makes you want to go get a rope and go out the back yard its better to live with your insanity and not want to breathe & living with your demons is the lesser evil even though both are misery lol ,0
daylight savings seems to trigger mine or going off my meds i miss it too but am too scared of what will happen,1
like many have already said everyones circumstances are different and we should not judge it is difficult to work if you are constantly having panic attacks cant focus on tasks or on what your boss is saying freezing up when people speak to you etc disability may or may not be a permanent thing but age is not always an indicator of how "ready" or capable someone is of working also with age can come an understanding and growth of coping mechanisms and medication adjustments that could lead to being able to work someday but she needs money in the meantime yeah? just saying just because shes young doesnt mean she is more capable of overcoming her disability and in this case it may actually work against her i do agree she should not give up hope of working someday but acting like she is immature because she struggles with debilitating mental illness is very condescending and shows a lack of empathy and understanding that not everyone is like you and just because you have/had it bad doesnt mean there isnt someone who has it worse,1
im not familiar with that certain type of medication; however your body (eg the neck pain and aches) is going to need time to adjust to the transition i wouldnt worry too much unless your pain persists for more than at least a couple of months the only analogy i can think of is a woman goes through 9 months of pregnancy and her body isnt going to bounce back the day of birth nonetheless hope everything works out,0
i have homicidal ideations when i get extremely agitated or irritated i hear voices when im depressed,0
so many of us on this page do understand the reality is when you suffer with thoughts like this thesethoughts lie to you everything is not falling apart you just feel like its falling apart tomorrow the sun will rise the only secret to continuing on is continuing on dont be afraid to reach out for help we are rooting for you and im praying for you right now tomorrow will be better,0
i take lithium zoloft seroquel valium kilnopin addral i have ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression adhd,1
this is contingent on what the the trigger of the panic attack is if there is one if the source of anxiety is caused by an exisiting phobia there is an establishd and ingrained pattern that is very hard to turn around on the spot without medication i would say just dont diminish the persons concerns and hang in there till its over,1
is ect eclectic therapy? what do u know about it i have severe depression  anxiety  ptsd bpd  bipolar  im starting to get (agoraphobia?) i can barely leave my house without a panic attack im not taking meds atm (i have before but none ever worked so i thought id try more natural methods didnt work and waiting on a referral to try new meds again) i had an aunt get the electric stuff done (i always called it electro shock but its not called that anymore not sure what exactly its called) but anyway my aunt had bad mental health as well and they suggested it so she tried it shes never been the same she cant remember her phone number or bank info n pin numbers  she has bad memory loss and is often delusional about peoples intentions shes extremely paranoid and has very bad self care  this turned me off to the whole treatment and i cant understand why its still used is that not the usual reaction ? id like to know some more information if possible,0
i understand exactly how you feel i would sit and listen to my dr drone on and on about medicine i was taking and the dosage i have been thru a gambit of drugs with no success finally i got angry and told the dr i was not a test dummy to give me something that worked i just wanted to feel better i believe i scared the dr because i yelled so loud i told him i needed him to listen to me because it was my turn to talk my appointment ran over but he got my message im not cured but im doing one hell of a lot better i moved into an apartment 2 years ago and still have unpacked boxes in the kitchen i used to be a bundle of energy now nothing seems to rattle me because i know ill get to it eventually,0
no i am not i do recommend epilim over lithium for high or low blood pressure hawthorne tablets work,1
honestly you are not being dramatic about it your feelings are real you dont have to continue suffering like this there is help for you i know its real hard to ask for it when you are independent i suffered for years without any help from anyone and it got so bad i just had to say something i was on a mood stabiliser and anti depressant before my pregnancy and they were both taken away for the first 12 weeks and then i was allowed my mood stabiliser after 12 weeks but not the anti depressant please see a doctor they will prescribe something to you if the benefits of medication outweigh the cons you really do need to be monitored to make sure you arent going to get any worse and im high risk post natal depression if you talk to your family they can keep an eye on you after the baby is born a doctor can refer you to counselling too you may find it easier to talk about how you really feel with a stranger i wish you all the luck xx,1
what about the teacher bad mouthing first?? he destroyed this girls life and she retaliated by doing the same both to blame im afraid i do not condone anything i have read in this topic but im just saying the damage has been done people know the truth sometimes its just best to let sleeping dogs lie and try to move on from this it could have been worse and it wasnt so you are really lucky there best of luck to you and i hope you manage to forgive yourself because unfortunately you will most likely never forget,0
i am incredibly alone and lonely in my psychiatric illnesses of bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder generalized anxiety disorder and post traumatic stress disorder with permanent short-term memory loss since electroconvulsive therapy in 2002 nobody understands all of what i experience i would not wish any of it on anyone i have researched it all i thus know a considerable amount about such illnesses even borderline personality disorder i identity with you,1
i worry now because i say" like" people yet again see things about m/h,0
i think its always going to be upsetting when you read such personal info on fb before you have been updated its pretty rude but not worth your energy to completely flip out on your sister; you need all the energy you can muster just to deal with your life right now have a chat to hospital staff & see who is down as next of kin - is it you your sister or someone else? blessings,0

honestly my best resource has just been youtube i would start with a video called something like "buddhist monk explains meditation" its a really good place to start bc the video explains exactly what meditation is and isnt if you cant find the video im speaking of let me know and ill find you the link meditation is a deeply personal thing and i think it should be customized to what serves each person best and the great part about it is you can literally do it any time during any activity its more about retraining your brain rather than trying to clear your mind of all thought feel free to add me as a friend and ill help in any way i can i know the struggle and if i can help lighten the load for one person or help them find some hope and peace that would help me as much as them <3 hope you find this helpful,0

depression is not just "feeling down" talk to a professional youve described some of the major symptoms of depressive disorder and an anxiety disorder i wouldnt suggest self diagnosis and i would suggest educating yourself on what major depressive disorder actually is and it is not feeling down or feeling sad as well as anxiety disorders which is where the overthinking worrying and panic seem to be getting to you you should try seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist if possible good luck its a long confusing battle but we can all do it!,1

mental illness is so misunderstood by the average person who does not have it or knows anyone close to them who is dealing with iti hope you are talking with a psychatrist or therapistthey can put u in touch with the right kind of therapysometimes you are the kind of person that can not hold down a job where other ppl are involved with your daily activitiesif your mental health is taking over all your work time and home timei would suggest you should seek out ssdi or ssi benefitsyou need more counseling and therapy for yourselfyou need to work on yourself right nowthe stress of work is maybe to much right nowthe psycharist will help explain why u cut and how to get another outlet instead of harming yourselfif your work is making you turn to doing this you need to stop going therei know its easier said then donetry to work on what i said earlier in this postthe less stress for you would help alotyou cannot change how other ppl perceive you or what they thinkand thats okyou have to take care of yourself right nowyou can though remove yourself from these situations where you wont be mocked or where they just dont understand itif u are living with your momgo to a psycharist at the states financial helpevery state has a program for low income{if u leave your job}i know it will be hard but seems like you need to start with a psycharistdoing what you are doing everyday is not getting u anywheretry something different by the suggestions i would takesorry your mother is not more supportivesome ppl are incapable of understanding it sorry to sayeven familyhope this helpsgod bless!,1
i say try and relax about things focus on your school and where you want to go from there jobs almost always offer little pleasure so dont feel that you need to be in love with your work (it would be better of course but hopefully thatll be fixed after your education is finished) you mentioned enjoying working with children maybe find something that would allow you to continue that interest dont worry about relationships like you said youre 20 i got married at 21 and it was a disaster because i had so little life expirence at the time there is no rush love will happen when it is ready,0
for me meds were a merry-go-round it can take a long time(years even) to find the right combo in my state wa mental health diagnosis is enough to get you on the states medicaid program (aka obamacare) and dshs i look at meds and mental illness like type 2 diabetes the pills initially help get it under control then you focus on a healthy diet and exercise as part of your management plan in addition to your regular check ups - you can eventually go off the diabetes meds if you get your condition under control for me that translated into good sleep hygiene (super important mood swing trigger) a reduction in inflammatory foods abstain from alcohol proper vitamin levels (checked via blood test by my doctor) known to be linked to depression and mental illness (deficiencies in vitamin d b vitamins etc) some sort of exercise like walking or recumbent bike (where you can zone out and practice positive self mantras "i am worth this effort" "i am not my illness and my illness doesnt define who i am") and intensive therapy/counseling 1x/wk which eventually became needed only 1x/mo learn how to handle stress and life events that can trigger an episode i went from rapid cycling to practically stable and medication free took me the better part of 4yrs i struggled all through my childhood (knew something was wrong with me since i was 12) until i hit 30 and decided to take control of my life because i couldnt keep going the way i had been living i struggled all through my 20s with a wrong diagnosis of depression and insomnia and improper meds things changed when i got the right diagnosis another thing to keep in mind bipolar and other mental health disorders usually have co-morbid disorders and components that may not appear until later in life or be hidden by the primary and initial diagnosis,1
first off she is very lucky to have someone who is so supportive so give yourself credit for that! i have bipolar and depression and on my bad days some times my spouse has difficulty handling it or knowing the right things to do so i understand (from how he has explained it) how you are feeling i cant speak for everyone as everyone is different but for me the whole pushing everyone away is somethibg that happens to me a lot especially during episodes i dont want anyone near me i have trouble feeling connected to anything or anyone including my spouse for me what means a lot to me is that he is supportive as well and doesnt give up on me even when i want him to sometimes even if i want to reach out and talk i cant bring myself to do it so i shut everyone out instead when im in that state of mind im certain that i am a burden to everyone and that everyone will give up on me reassurance is something i need a lot i would say just make sure that she knows that you are there with her that she s not alone and that you love her and that you will be there beside her while she gets through this she may try to push you away and i would imagine its not an easy thing to feel but dont take it to heart its her illness talking not her sometimes the illnesses can take control of us i can think of countless times when i am pushing my spouse away or being mean so he will go away but on the inside i want nothing more than to be with him but i cant bring myself to say those words or to drop that wall that i have up being stuck inside yourself is scary you are doing the right thing by being there for her and she will come out of this! ❤,0
i genuinely dont know how else to say this if a person is taking the wrong meds/no meds at all their ability to think clearly and make good decisions can disappear if you let her hit rock bottom- how will she know shes wrong if she cant control her brain? shes the mother of your children she deserves more respect shes always going to be in your life and so is her mental illness think of it this way- if one of your kids develops a mental illness which is possible due to genetics how would you feel if they were clearly not well and making bad decisions and (god forbid) their long time significant other took the kids and ran? i highly doubt youd support or respect that right now your kids see whats going on they might not understand it but they see it no amount of good parenting will hide that do it for them because they deserve a healthy mom,0
paula santana so many cooks in the kitchen! i appreciate that people care but it can all be so muddled if a year or whenever from now you do decide to come off do the 7 a day method: take seven of those tiny beads out of the pill day one & two then 14 the next two then 21you get the idea it was tough but i was able to do it (note: im back on it after trial & error and a horrid hellacious divorce) good luck!,0
thanks sagaren lm so happy that you found the strength to conquer the feelings of insecurity and lack of self worth i pray that through your post above many will see a seed they can plant and are able to implement the three steps to self healing we need our meds perhaps for the rest of our lives but as with diabetes or hypertension our minds may need these too these various chemicals are critical to stabilize the much needed balance and hopefully we find that balance the rest is up to us and even more critical l believe we have to stop all the inward-directed thoughts i have i have i have (sorry everyone) sure we have but with the practice you outline above we can begin to make even one small shift in our minds one small shift of mindset today followed by another small shift next month followed by more and more and bringing some small degree of happiness to ourselves! all by ourselves what an achievement! go tell your doc/psych what youve achieved tell your family - no show them the new you! you have the power it lies within the mind that makes you dwell on the negatives try hard to be kind to yourself learn to love yourself find the happiness and joy that lies within you sending everyone struggling and hurting all my love i shall keep you in my prayers love and showers of blessing film <3 <3,0

i cant really comment as its different here in uk - you cant just check yourself into hospital you really need to be ill and having been an inpatient many times often for long periods its not a good environment but if you feel you really struggling and really not coping with daily life if going into hospital is an option you shouldnt be ashamed or as if you letting people down  care for yourself,0
do you think i dont know what its like? the fact that you assume i didnt understand makes you ignorant i have ptsd anxiety manic bipolar depression and rad im not the one who gets child support you idiot because im their step mother that is taking care of them their mother doesnt get child support and him not wanting to have a job to at least take off his kids was my point there so until you have been in my shoes and can understand what the fuck i am going through with my issues and all of the effort and strength i have put into trying to help us you can kiss my fucking ass i am not giving up on him i cant do it anymore because he is making my illnesses worse and i cant keeping living that way i will always be there for him and those kids and he knows that but we can not be together anymore and that was a mutual decision not like i owe you a fucking explanation you ignorant twat ive been suicidal since i was 12! you think i dont think about it every fucking day!,0
i worry about the consequences of asking for help,1
ive lost a lot of jobs due to my bipolar disorder and very bad horrible anixety right now im working one on one with clients in a health care setting and im thriving even able to work overtime just have to find the right field of nursing for you i know youll be able to do it with the right combo of meds and some time,1
that is pretty universal for at least part of the experience after a while being out of control can be very terrifying,0
i hate having both anxiety is a constant for me and it always has been depression comes and goes but when i have them both at the same time i feel like a walking contradiction desperate for connection yet i want to be alone and not talk to anyone my body is tired but my mind is tangled with everything that i didnt do and how badly i might have messed up what i did do having both is truly what nightmares are made of,0
he might have wothdrawal like symptoms because his anxiety is rising over the lack of med and upset caused by the doctors lack of care seek out a new doctor if possible and report this one,1
my parents are still in denial my mom understands something is wrong but not exactly what it is and my dad just tells me "its all in my head" i mean duh it is lol but he doesnt mean it like that i was diagnosed with depression at 15 bipolar and bpd at 23 im 30 now and they are still telling me this haha it frustrates me and makes me kind of upset when people dont understand or make an effort to understand but still feel the need to put their 2 cents in  im not religious so when people give me that i get even more upset,0
and antidepressants help with anxiety they took away my panic attacks when i was young,1
i didnt like i only took at night around 7or 8 and id still feel the affects the next day tell around 2 in the afternoon i had the weirdest dreams on it also bad hot sweats felt like a zombie all day long then they gave me something to take for mood stabilizer like wtf smhbeen on ever med for deppession & ocd& anxiety there nothing i havent been on  i used to get kidney stones often also my gallbladder & liver dont function right i had the worse stomach pain every ive been using medical marijuana now for about 8 yrs and juicing fresh fruits & veggies and my life has been given back to me my body & mind feel healed and yes i still have depression but its under control and now im in control and never felt more better in my life herbalism really worked for me,0
i suffer from the same i try to talk myself out of it but it is very difficult i hope you find a way to tackle this i know how terrifying it is,0
anxiety is a hell of a thing :(,0
never a doubt,0
the past is not worth worring about its gone you have no furture if you are living in the past is what got me out of it if you have like a record from your past that always runs in your head write it down you can worry about the future you dont know what it is dont fear it you can write out your plans for the week let it go you can always make goals for the future and write it down i write stuff down cause like you my head was pack with confusing stuff i had no way to change or predict i hope this makes sense sometimes i dont even make sense to myself lol,0
maybe so kayla ive had this al my life and im not going to lie it is a struggle but with the correct medicine ? you can lead a semi normal life one day at a time and the power of positive thinking please keep your chin up ,0
i take buspar 2x a day every day and then i have ativan 3 per day as need at 1mg per pill im also on 4 other meds also since i cant go out in public with out having a panic attack,0
valerie wencka i dont disagree with your opinion but how you spoke it im personally weaning off meds with the help of an amazing husband change in diet and therapy i still have sleep meds and anxiety meds both on an as needed basis im also starting college on monday so that may change,1
your parents have and children that lived sir yes sir i kinda doubt that you so ugly you could be a modern art master peace,0
in general it is not used even in bipolar they try not to use it if they can avoid it because of the way it can beat the kidneys up she didnt say lithium someone in the responses did not sure if it was you or not im happy it works for you its a battle a lot of the time finding what works for each of us i was speaking in overall general terms,1
ill try i said most yes some are so affected by this that they cant function and they become homeless but what is the solution? we have any overwhelmed ss system  i was diagnosed bipolar i work because i have a family and myself to take care of but i feel overwhelmed so much at work i often feel it would be better to be dead,0
everyday is a struggle try not to go to that dark placejust pops up ,0
ive been on it twice in my life both times for about a year but the side effects were horrid didnt ease up much even with time so i took myself of it this time and the withdrawal was horrid and ill never take it again and im sick of hearing drs say this drug doesnt have withdrawals because they were worse then any anti depressant ive ever been on and ive been on a lot of them,0
once you find the right meds it usually takes at least two or three together then you will have a big step forward meds cant take away personal issues in your life but it will allow you to handle tense situations a lot better,1
i get short of breath and heart palpitations i saw the doctor but it was anxiety,1
please discuss the risks of accutane with your doctor before taking it i know multiple people that had terrible side effects,1
well i was diagnosed with bipolar several years ago but the personality thing scares the crap outta me i dont even much about it because im scared to find out,0
its better to be honest i thinksome type of person to guide you is a good idea i think 7 is a fine age as long as you speak 7 year oldthere are many uncomfortable things i had to explain to my kidsand not just about my mental illness im sure youve had to also i was a bit nervous when mental illness was the subjectbut realized it just like explaining other stuff be prepared for tons of questions or none at allya never knowi also found that even with a professional guiding me it was better that i did most of the talking only because if there were more questions they would not feel worried to ask me because the pro wasnt aroundthats just me tho itll be ok ,0
i guess i would if they could talk about it but myself i dont think im ready for one i tried earlier in the year but her attitude to things didnt help i never told her about my own issues but she belittled other peoples that i just never went back to see her i still have a lot of pain from a long term relationship break up she was unfaithful and untruthful accused me of doing what she was actually doing i couldnt go out alone so i always took one of her kids with me they would tell me she asked if i spoke to any ladies while we was out if i went out with friends and she didnt come next day she would be checking pics on the venue or their fb accounts if she didnt see me i was accused of meeting someone and using the friends as excuse (it was what she was doing)! i guess i still have feelings for her even thought shes drove me down into deep depressive state and im now showing symptoms of social anxiety disorder and paranoia would i want to be with someone like it? im really not sure the normal me is non judgemental compassionate understanding and empathic but the current me is struggling with my own issues im not sure i could cope with another with similar or worse issues!,0
when i decided i wanted to get pregnant i weaned myself off my antidepressant first i didnt risk it,0
you need encouragement support n love to help you thru thisdo u like to read?! anger comes from avoidanceinspirational books with scriptures are very helpful n writing in a journal as wellyou are in my thoughts and prayersdont let the devil lie to you by telling you theres no hope n that your defeatedfight back n get your life back! ♡ xoxo,0

nope!! i was impatient hospital 4months and my wife came every single day went to counseling read bipolar and anxiety books had two years doing well then this past year was impatient a week she came every day in sickness and in health! you deserve that and youd do the same for him!! (((hugs))),0
i tried going off meds as i dont like having to rely on all these tablets it was quite honestly the worst decision i have ever made in my life! all was well initially and then things would upset me then smaller things upset me more and so on and so on in the end i ended up in such a bad place i tried to end it all i spent 3 days in icu now i religiously take my medication even when theyre not right for me i keep regular appointments with my psych team and 2 years on although my meds are still not right im in a much better place than i was without them,1
this attitude valerie is one that really upsets me dont you think those of us multiple medications to feel bad enough already,0
you are brave and clearly a fighter i have a son that struggles as well and i understand the struggles keep your head up!,0
this is the most accurate description of anxiety ive ever read,1
it is totally disturbing,0
im not ashamed or apologize for being ill i feel for those who hide through lifei havent hid in over a decade,0
i hear you work is a major stressor for a lot of people with mental health issues what ive learned is stay in the moment and practice mindfulness stay focused at the task at hand if anxiety strikes go to the bathroom to remove yourself from the situation and breathe for a few minutes its hard i understand i work part time and its a problem for me too dealing with anxiety that work triggers  you must tell yourself that you know exactly what you doing you are also a valuable employee  its so difficult feeling with others in the workplace  keep to yourself stay focused and do your best and if you panic in front of others dont worry it wont be the end of the world everyone has anxiety at one time or another but its hard hang in there think of the money and the worse anxiety of being unemployed repeat to yourself this feeling will pass and move on in the moment  xxxx,0
recently i met a woman i really liked adored felt compassion for and respected and the other day she hurt me badly and let me go from my job even by lying to do it i was so hurt for this person was one in a million to me i didnt take her for granted i didnt obsess over her but she was integral in my choice to work there and my happiness there i think we bipolar pick up on certain qualities and characteristics but overlook the reality of how that person can be in the given environment and what we get is not all there is to see we need to be careful,0
all i could say is i feel your pain i am bipolar and general anxiety disorder and depression iv suffering a lot lately my doctor just switched too im not use to my new doctor yet and he took me off my old meds ativan and oxycarbozapine i know ativan is addicting but it worked my anxiety is to bad with out it im now taking seraqual for sleep it makes me sleep nbut with side affects light headed dizzy and nauses and clonzapin for anxiety does not help to well hopefully he gets to no me and knows i dont abuse meds just take as needed and he will put me back on my old meds so i can feel better take care and hang in there,1

you are not alone ive had some very dark lows myself i have c-ptsd with anxiety major depressive disorder and repressed memories ive been to that dark numb place where everything that could harm you reminds you of how much easier it would be but dont give up it may be that you are on a medication that doesnt work well for you or the dosing could be incorrect i went through a dark period for weeks feeling like i just wanted to end it all i was numb and felt empty i didnt have any real good support around i finally got back to my doctor who adjusted my medication and a few weeks later i started to feel better it wasnt perfect fast and believe me i still have really bad days but you are not alone i am here if you ever need to talk,0
same here i am off meds as they are not helping me in anyway i am depressed from last 8 months i am 54 and jobless from last 2 years i left my job thinking my life will be stress free but the depression never goes and i continue to live with bipolar for eternity,1
when you constantly worry about things and feel as if you things are out of control ~sandi~,0
everything you described is systems that we all experience impulsive decisions that arent thought through the biggest issue is when we are going through an episode we dont recognize it serquol has helped me recognize when i am having an episode i have been on it for over 15 years it takes about three months for the medication to really get into your system and not experience the side effects i also have to take sleep aids due to obsessive thoughts nightmares and,1
terri ridlon please explain night terrors i think i have them thanks,0
absolutely there are many who suffer ptsd from traumatic birth particularly those whose children were born premmie or if there were medical complications for mother and baby before and after birth i dont know where you are but there are a few pages specific to women whom suffer from birth trauma here in australia one such page is called panda (perinatal anxiety and depression australia) you may also have other underlying problems from the type of environment you grew up in,1
relationships are hard with my first marriage i had was emotionally abused i thought i would die too but i pushed past that and now i am remarried and happy having suicidal thoughts is normal i have had depression anxiety bipolar you name it i have it however each day i wake up its another day i had fought my demons you need to find what is best for you do not be ashamed of getting help life is hard dealing with mental illness and a lot of ppl cannot figure out how to overcome it just remember even though you suffer everyday you are fighting a battle that can be won it does not define who you are with what you have life has a funny way of of showing that there is hope out there you just have to see it good luck i honor you for going for your dreams in the air force just remember even though you suffer everyday you will survive it is not your time yet,0
i have ptsd anxiety and antisocial personality disorder it took years to get me on the right meds but i seem to have more good days than bad now its hard to manage all 3,1
try to remember when making your appointment that you arent committing to taking anything just by making the appointment you will have time to talk with the prescribing doctor about some of your fears and feelings only after discussing these things will you need to decide if this is the right route for you most likely meds wont be the only recommendation some form of therapy group or individual will be helpful with modifying your thought processes about the best way to take care of you maybe your boyfriend can go with you to help with that conversation then if you decide to take medication please be patient it takes some time to figure out if its the right one (or combo) for you i will say that meds have saved my life in the past i still get cranky sometimes about having to take meds and i get cranky that i still have to work with therapists or groups for my particular illnesses (why cant it just be one or the other??) but these efforts far outweigh how lousy i feel when my illness is in charge of me i hope this helps you best of luck in your journey be well <3,1
if reaching out to me is something you feel may helpim here and ive shut many out on my journey and been so scared its like ill never walk out the door living alone trapped for many monthsso i mean it when i say im here for you,0
i am 6 months pregnant with my first and most of my pregnancy ive been very depressed no idea why ive wanted to be a mom for a long time so sometimes i feel even worse because i beat myself up for feeling like this but i cant control it it just got really bad about 2 months in i literally dont feel normal i just want to stay locked in my bedroom all day and all night and most days i do just that i am on celexa i was on it before i got pregnant but since ive been feeling so bad my ob actually increased my dose a couple months ago i feel like its helped but im still not 100% feeling like myself or "normal" i see my doctor tomorrow and im hoping she can recommend something to help without increasing my dose again because im already nervous about being on medication while pregnant even though my doctor has reassured me over and over again it is safe and the risks are very low i can relate to what youre going through so you can talk to me if it might help today i just started crying and couldnt stop im just so drained from feeling like this i want to be excited and motivated about this pregnancy and i just want to be a good mom i think you should talk to your doctor again soon and i personally think you should try the celexa it could really benefit you it does take about a full month to kick it but in the long run it could totally help you hope you start to feel better soon,0
everyday struggle ,0
i am down to depakote and effexor i have been on them a long time eighteen years and in the past two months was able to decrease them i was on naproxen and allergy meds meds get mixed up together and cause more side effects like depression i had an episode where my liver and kidney enzymes were higher than normal this year and being 61 i am taking that to heart i have alpha 1 antitrypsin enzyme deficiency anyone with liver disease or lung disease of any kind should be tested for this taking the liver damaging medications if you have this condition can kill your liver i was taking tylenol twice a day 1000 mg just to keep going with arthritis this is hard on the kidneys i take it but as needed now i am in pain and i am stiff and some days i cant do much at all but i do not want to die from liver failure or kidney failure these things can happen and they can be silent until the damage is great we cant just pop pills we have to do other stuff to be emotionally healthy we have to stay engaged emotionally and have relationships with people that will help us reality test and ground us this is not to say that we should not make our own decisions we must but others around us can help us make good decisions we cant let our mental illness isolate us or think of ourselves as different because of psych diagnoses we gotta push through the emotions get hurt forgive and learn all we can about what to be like and not be like from our encounters with others also our need for mental health drugs changes over time sometimes we just have to settle down and not allow ourselves to get so upset we have to learn coping and calming strategies we did not learn before no matter what age we are every day is a new day a lot of people advocate for exercise meditation the arts etc i read the bible and pray i seek gods help to live a christian life to be a loving person it is easy to be selfish and grouchy or self centered and depressed we dont have to give in to it for me rest goes a long way getting along with others can be tough if you are a parent you cant always do what you want because of others needs you compromise a lot life goes on you live and learn hopefully you will not need so many meds for a really long time if you need them you need them dont let them rob you of your life god bless,0
many of you seem to be struggling but be advised its a character test some pass some fallout but its very difficult to go it alone stick together united and your odds increase tenfold,0
to be flat out honest with you i used to cope with my anxiety with alcohol i didnt know what was wrong with me i thought the worst i went to the dr and he said "it sounds like anxiety" and i was like ok he prescribed me meds and i felt like a new person dont get me wrong i hate going to the dr and having to pay a lot for my prescription but its worth it!,0
most people suffer in silence; too ashamed to ask for help do not judge a book by its cover,0
suicide i know its a personal struggle for everyone be it the people you leave or you doing the leaving i think if we had a place we could go and everyone we left knew were we where and new we could come back that would be easier but being locked away is not what helps the pain is so excruciating and at its worst you feel like your dying anyway and when your at your pretend best its worse because your playing pretend be more than annoyed at the person whos gone but then imagine them with an illness thats terminal because it is would you except a terminal person committing suicide ???,0
all medications have some kind of side effects but everyones experience is different the medicines information leaflet will list all potential side effects according to severity and how common they are remember any antidepressant will take a good few weeks to produce benefit as you gradually increase dosage i was on venlafaxine xl ( check if that what you have been prescribed as xl means it gradually releases rather than all at once) for many years with no issues but i was prescribed trazadone and had serious reaction to it and ended up having breakdown and in hospital similar to what you described but i that is very rare the withdrawal symptoms of venlafaxine are brutal - even after missing one days dose you will start to feel dreadful so if you are not good at remembering then venlafaxine is not ideal as its best to try and take them at the same time each day you could put reminders on you mobile choose times when you always do something and include taking your tablets,0
i am 31 and lived my whole life with the illness and was diagnosed at 30 as a child i always new i was not fine my emotions were uncontrollable and i did not understand got bad from 25 as a result i almost lost my life attempted suicide thats how i got diagnosed i am taking my meds going to therapy but everyday is a struggle i battle i thought i should be fine by now i have been taking meds for a year and 4 months,0

i have no answer for you but i would like to say that anyone who trys to devalue you and what you are going through are irrelevant ignore them do not let them make you feel bad i know how hard it can get i have my own struggles and it is so hard to work full time while suffering if you need to do this and your are seeking help them good for you do what you need to do to take care of yourself and please do not let anyone who tries to devalue your experience succeed it just show their lack of empathy and character my heart goes out to you and i wish you the best you are worth healing you are worth loving and you are valid,0
sunshine fresh air music i made a conscious decision to put up with the troughs because i love the peaks (although the beta blockers/diazepam get rid of 90% of the associated anxiety) as long as the ptsd doesnt synch up with the more extreme highs/lows then im pretty safe,0
google "deep breathing for anxiety" find a method you like and practice it at least twice each day it will help you to control the anxiety that is closely associated with the depression i hope this helps,1
i am diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and i only experience hypomania -but i tell you what-that list is me all over-except for time being irrelevant ( i am very time obsessive) and having no fear of death oh i also obsess about getting the right amount of sleep i love my sleep and freak out if i dont get enough,1
^thats what i take my psychiatrist took me off klonopin because of how bad the side effects are and what new research about it has shown im also in counseling to help with the anxiety (among other things),1

i have bpd and i find the best thing that has helped me is quetipine when distressed i go up and down all the time also talking and counselling,1
i was feeling hopeless too for quite some time and couldnt get my severe panic and agoraphobia under control finally found a med combo that works i still have a journey ahead of me but im doing much better you will find that too you just have to keep trying different meds and therapy dont know you or your situation but i believe theres hope for us all,1
i understand your pain i just found out a few months ago i have bipolar also i have been all my life i thought i just had ocd panic and anixety attacks but now i find out i have pstd and bipolar too all these years i have been on the wrong meds and it was making my bipolar worse,1
yes im the same if i get out of my daily ruteen and if i got to viset drs i dread it just get paranoyed about people that will be in waiting room,0
i have ptsd bipolar schitsoeffective add i just took myself off off lithium pristique adderall sereqil just because i desperately want to change my dr i found one in the same bldg i like that one he was recommended by my therapist they both had a meeting the other day the one i want to go to said it would be best if i stayed with current dr? i asked why he said to long to answer shouldnt i have the right to change i am petrified of the current dr,0
im definitely guilty of pushing people away and sabotaging relationships,0
i have this problem as well i am also bipolar too but it sounds like you are starting to get panic attacks which is often done by crying i would seek out a dr for anxiety meds to help control the anxiety you have crying is normal most women do it when they get stressed out but if the crying gets worse either go with medication or a counselor it will help stop the crying,1
theres something seriously wrong with a doctor allowing a patient to run out of medication and give no refills there can be horrible side effects and your depression can get worse i would do what someone else said and go to the er-- they will help you and they may even report your physician take your empty bottle of med with you to show when it was filled and therefore also show when it ran out they will contact your doctor and get some answers and help you,1
i took it for a while but had to stop due to it causing headaches but i tell my patients 3 things about it 1 it tastes horrible (even the drug reps say so) 2 it will make your face go numb for a bit and 3 you will make a face the 1st time you try it most of my patients tolerate it ok,0
if i cant sleep i put the light on not because im afraid of the dark but because then i see the real word and not whats rattling around in my head ,0
many youth services organizations have positions that require only a hs diploma or ged you would mentor and plan activities for at risk kids one on one some college or x yrs experience in the field is usually required no degree tho,0
my perspective: i abhor the fact that people still stay that "suicide is selfish" its not it personally irritates me when people say "think of how many people you will hurt" i think these are all comforting cliches that people just use just to use it thats why getting to know people is important  because the cliches i just mentioned i bet a few others feel this way those "comforting cliches " may only hurt more for example those two phrases hurt worse and as a person struggling with suicide ideations right now that those two phrases just made it worse for me  because i was a ward of the state my parents gave me up and i dont know the rest of my family i cant connect with peoplei just feel im socially awkward or an introvert so right now i feel really alonebut to be honestsucide is not right but what do you do when you have given life your all and you have tried to remain positive with such a crappy hand that was dealt especially since day 1 you were told you were a mistake can you say those "comforting cliches" then ? i have bpd depressionptsd and anxietyim not trying to be a debbi downer kinda feel like i need some helpsome people have no idea what is going through a persons mind about suicide lets be mindful of that,0
thuis is goed olanzapine?? also for anxiety?? ,1
be open minded about it i hear theres been great success using emdr for your issues but you need to open to exploring and dont do anything youre uncomfortable with good luck!,1

after months of finding the right dose i feel great! side affect i have is weight gain but i knew that would happen its still easy to lose the weight i just need to exercise more and eat right but mentally i have to have the right dose to feel better i cant remember my dose my mom is the one who controls my pills after a scare she had last year not related to abilify as i wasnt on it back then,0
yes you could very well call the members of this site a community because we all have something in common would you be offended if you were a red sox fan and the announcer referred to you as being part of red sox nation? i highly doubt it,0
having a mental illness means sometimes dosages need to be adjusted or medications need to be changed my exwife struggled for years until she found the right medication and dosage first it was lithium then topamax finally depakote worked the best medications for depression and anxiety are somewhat the same you have to get the medication that works best and the correct dosage for my anxiety clonzapam was the right medication from the start but depression medication is an on going challenge first it was pristiq then lexapro cymbalta amatriptyline and countless others to date i am still searching for the right medication sometimes these take time but dont give up hope you will get it right and you will know it my exwife knew she was on the right medication without anyone telling her so,1
i was a mixture of scared of my own shadow and abesolutely fearlesstwo guess which caused more troublelol,1
i take a couple supplements that are natural that may help these are not in place of the medications your psychiatrist prescribes you these supplements can be purchased from "thorne research" they are not habit forming & you can take them with any medication you may be on my psychiatrist & other drs are aware i take these supplements & are pleased at night i take 3 of the "l-tryptophan" to help me sleep i also add a few capsules of "gaba" as well "gaba" has a calming & relaxing affect "l-tryptophan" is in turkey & naturally aids with sleep im prescribed xanax it is necessary but i try to take it as little as possible since gaba calms & relaxes i try to take gaba in place of xanax when possible especially during the day gaba will relax you but will not make you impaired or fall asleep while driving etc i suffer from social anxiety gaba calms my anxiety without the side effects of benzos xanax is necessary at times yet the less i takethe better oh fyi gaba is also helpful with alcohol & drug withdrawal symptoms i personally take the "pharma gaba 250" they also make gaba 100 most people dont need as much as i take youll have to see what works for you hope this helps good luck to you,1
i learned the same in the hospital it breaks the anxiety cycle but you really must actually do it and it will also help your concentration,1

ive taken for yrs yes if you take it and watch tv or read etc then you end up walking snacking cleaning etc but in my case i had but know what im doing at the time do found ive done nothing out of my character just more obsessed with eating or cleaning! next morning i may have forgotten in morning but do remember with prodding you must go to bed take it close your eyes and go to sleep nothing else my husband swears it wont work unless he takes it 1/2 hour before uuuuggg! ive had to tell him "!go to bed!" hes ate a whole bag of popcycles in bed! or try and hold a conversation with others so as it works for some with no side effects not so hot for others were all different chemically it will effect differently unfortunately i have als i need it to sleep and it works but take it and immediately go to sleep if you have trouble stop!,1
if the doctor and therapist dont know they cant help please let them know my son can be alone but cant sleep in his room upstairs he is 34 he sleeps on the couch to be nearer to us but we can go overnight about twice a year and he says he isnt scared has 2 dogs that is what helps him,0

all the people complaining about this does not understand and are most likely fakers looking for attention this is a real medical condition and judging someone due to having bi-polar sex drive is horrid you need to leave not the people looking for help or information,0
sometimes we need to just be left alone for a minute and thats ok and sometimes we can be misinterpreting good intentions and helpful words either way i think if you feel overwhelmed then its a good time to take a step back from everyone altimtly they are your family and they do love you i can write a book on family drama ive been told as much lol sometimes they dont kno how to love us in the ways we need it so like i said take yourtime off but dont cut them off completely my advice,0

only thing that keeps me going is earning a bit more money and often main reason i dont commit suicide is because i dont want my siblings to inherit my share of the family fortune how sad is that? i cant tolerate anyones opinions i cant get on with "friends" i take everything seriously i dont go to meetings because i get really stressed out with people there i am an artist apparently very good according to a well established art expert and artist who loves my paintings  but i cant stand working with anyone especially other students (i am at college) i fall out with just about everyone then want to be alone i am huge misfit  i had gender reassignment nearly 3 years ago but now feel really depressed about what i did my love life is pretty good i have a lover who looks after me and i am fairly well off plenty spare cash because i am always selling things i dont get on with my father who doesnt understand me or my kids i live on my own with my cat ironically i get really lonely but i cant stand company  yes i did get diagnosed with aspergers/adhd 5 years agoi came of anti depressants in feb and feel better in some ways but i think about killing myself every day even though i am better off than lots of people have a lot of freedom have two cars nice house nice cat only thing i am really good at is art and i hate everyone else in the art world there so full of crap for a woman i am strange as i am obsessed with motor cars i started drinking again after being of alcohol for ten years but dont feel right drinking now as a female as i did when male i hate being transgender very few seem to understand my life is in a relative "state of calm "yet i want to end it maybe i am fueled by disaster and prefer disaster,0
what so ever  i strongly believe that the problem with her is that she have kids without father single parental kids and their father or mother which one is living with them often spend disturb lives,0
having a mental illness sucks its impossible for others to understand unless youre showing physical signs it is no different than cancer heart disease diabetes etc all these conditions require medication in order to get better the mental anguish we go through is hell its frustrating not to be understood or express ourselves i take it one day at a time i cant predict whats going to happen tomorrow or how im going to feel i know how you feel ive been there and live with the fear of being there again in the meantime you do you screw everybody else you come first your mental well being comes first you are important to us and we care about you or we wouldnt be replying find something that makes you happy each daydont worry about tomorrow hugs,0
ive got it bad it overwhelms me wont wish it on anyone,0
someone offended me at work when i was able to keep a job at 10 am in the morning i was in a manic episode till 2 am the following morning shaking with pure (irrational) hatred,1
i take 75mg for depression which works really well for me i also take quetiapine at night (or through day for anxiety) and they work well for me,1
i take xanax and honestly its very helpful for me i dont do well with the energies of many people so whenever i an forced to go shopping i take 5mg and sometimes take another if the anxiety is intense im prescribed 3 max per day definitely consider it i havent noticed any withdrawal as i only use it when necessary also not sure if youre on other medicine but this is combined with paxil which is taken daily,1
i am on gabopentin for anxiety and it knocks me out i sleep all night i have never been able to do that with any other med,1
im addicted to the high after sex so if i dont get it frequently i feel angry and upset that gets directed at whoever im with i feel unwanted and unloved without that addiction being satisfied having a higher sex drive than a man hits their ego it makes them feel like they arent satisfying me properly i have sexual dreams where i wake up wanting it but they are tired lol aww i get the  im addicted to sex and porn talk  before and then after the reality is they arent i duno how else to explain it its complicated and bloody annoying to live with,0
often times these illnesses go hand in hand so its not uncommon to have multiple diagnoses since there are no tests diagnoses are made based on behavior over a period of time i have bp ii and have been on more meds than i can count over the years i also have thyroid problems but it has nothing to do with the meds it seems to be more related to the bp itself if youre having problems with weight gain tell your doctor to try a different med there are many available that was dont cause weight gain ive learned over the years that you have to be your own advocate do your research research the different meds available nutrition supplements etc and dont hesitate to make suggestions to your doctor if you cant tolerate certain side effects speak up if your doctor doesnt listen to you find a new doctor,1
i can totally empathise it is heartbreaking seeing your child really struggling with life the only advice i can offer is no matter what make sure your lecturer in son knows you love and support him and will be there for him no matter what which is easy to day but not always easy to do my son went through extreme periods of aggression verbal and physical and said some incredibly hurtful things which i really struggled with but i tried to remember it wasnt him things are much better now but i still look out for the tell tale signs its vital that you have good support too,0
i have both bpd and bipolar disorder 1 with psychotic features ptsd and ga i have struggled hard with suicidal ideation my psychiatrist has never told me i will always have those thoughts the last time i had a bad depression i was on the verge of becoming homeless i fought suicidal ideation for two months straight i even wrote a suicide note when i told my psychiatrist he didnt even bat an eye no med adjustment i had gotten through the crisis myself without going to hospital the thing is i completely was suicidal and it all hedged on if i could find a place to live or not i am disabled it was january i had just lost my van in the summer and was not moving by choice i have pets a mobility scooter and my son backed out of sharing a place with me at the last minute (i cant afford a place on my own i live in the third most expensive place to rent a one bedroom in canada) my daughter could only take me for two weeks or lose her rent subsidy and possibly get evicted so that was out i had nowhere to go i had been homeless before and i just didnt have the strength to do it again to lose everything again and end up in a tiny room without my pets was just too much for me i planned it of course the day i was to surrender my dog to a rescue i got the call that my now roommate and i were approved for a place i had planned on not waking up the next morning but i digress your therapist said you will always have those thoughts my psychiatrist never even addressed it and no i cant just get another doc theres a doctor shortage here people dont have doctors and are going to walk in clinics and the hospital because they have no doctor i dont think ill ever get past having those thoughts i just hope i never act on them this january was the closest ive been in several years to it,0
i work at home frequently but although i find the office environment really stressful and on occasion detrimental to my mh i wouldnt want to work at home everyday as i know myself and i wouldnt see anyone,1
i am right there with you  antidepressant + mood stabiliser + night sedation no meds for the anxiety though have to deal with those as and when they come what i have learned over over the last 20 yrs is that the meds keep me stable and safe the therapy makes life worth living,1
i was on the same med combois the effexor xr(long acting) if so try taking it at bedtimeit can make u tired at first so u r in bed at that time if u take at night trazadone is older gen drug with tired as a major side effect although it has a "window" where its easy to fall asleep after tat if u miss your window u can end up a bit anxious and wiredso again take 30 minutes before bed and then get into bed after taking both meds and do something relaxing (cup of chamomile tea reading whatever works 4 u) after i started taking both meds at bedtime i was much more functional during the day one caution300 mg effexor is just over therapeutic upper level i know cause i used to take that doseand it can be hard on the liver which can leave u tired so ask to have liver enzymes monitored regularly this wasnt done 4 me and ive had liver problems because they didnt monitor this properly also u might want to discuss swapping trazadone with remeron soltabs at bedtime talk to your doctor this drug was better at promoting a restful sleep each night which in turn helped me cope with symptoms during the day just my experiencesif anything helps im glad i sure understand the misery when it is a challenge just to get up and go to the damn bathroom!let alone keep on top of anything else that turns us into functional depressive patients,1
this is me alot of the time however i got the courage to see a counsellor and it has helped me not only talking through issues and thoughts you have but she has shown me techniques for coping with my anxiety and depression! i have seen some improvement,1
avoid sudden changes in doseage gradually is better,1
this  when youre scared to close your eyes at night  and when you open them the next morning you think oh shit not again,0
i would never wish my illness "bpd" on my worst enemy! im daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones and once i do tht i feel tht i have given into the negative because now i feel i cant change this spiral but instead have incouraged it my thoughts consume the way i feel on the outside i feel tht im constantly chasing the good days i recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost bpd is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it,0
caitlin summars i dont think i was being biased i was being very understanding to both sides in your first comment you definitely were being one sided considering you yourself struggle with mental illness i cant understand your lack of empathy you stated in your first comment a diabetic illness can take a life unlike a chemical imbalance thats all you said no explanation & i completely disagreed with that & no one should prefer to be labeled crazy ive had family members die of cancer & theyve definitely had more sympathy through their struggle than a person with a mental affliction love & understanding to all i will say no more,0
it comes at night it fallows they were both so terrible it comes at night literally left so many questions unanswered and was just really horribly crafted all together the acting was predictable the story was so broken and seemed like the director had 0 care for the film and it fallows it had not that great of acting and it was not submersible at all the plot was laughable and seemed almost like a joke,0
i used to take 600mg every night i couldnt wake up i couldnt go to school i couldnt remember shit and it gave me horrible restless foot syndrome like to the point im talking asleep but my foot needed to be moving id cry every night i stopped taking that shit its not worth it,0
i work nights cus i cant deal with social situations i have bipolar anxiety complex ptsd and depression and the only thing that keeps me same and gives me a purpose is going to work,1
omg i do that too its scary,0
i had to increase higher every month because i absorb and get used to things fast i felt more anxious at night which didnt help but it makes me fall asleep every night which is amazing for me!! didnt help with anything else though that i wanted it to though but everyone is obviously different!!!,1

suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem im 18 and i have attempted to commit suicide ive had thoughts about it since junior high i was hospitalized 5 months ago and i was hospitalized twice so my first time was november 2016and i was hospitalized in tijuana mexico they are not kind to you over there if you are a teen in the tijuana mental health hospital it sucks cuz i spent my 18th birthday at that hospital then i got released november 16 then a month later i was taken back for aggression so i was there for a month from december 12-january 12 so i spent christmas and new years there ill never get that back and i remember the huge stomach pain of anxiety because i thought my life was over and my family was going to abandon me but eventually the psychiatrist let them visit me and hope was brought back i got out after like a week of that visit and then the second time of getting out of the hospital i felt so much more depressed i was very open and honest about the intrusive thoughts of harming others or killing myself cuz i wanted to go away and the hospital would just tell me to control them and that the medication will work eventually it didnt so for the first time ever i began cutting i began to get threatened by my family and others to get the police called on me cuz of my actions and behavior that i couldnt control i was like this for about two or three months after the hospital i told myself i couldnt die no matter how much i had urges to jump off the bridge as i walked to college or jump infront of a car i just couldnt let myself die no matter how much i wanted too so i kept going through treatment it didnt work the medication or therapy so then in san diego my brother and his girlfriend discovered dbt therapy and at the same time when i started my semester in college again i got help from the school psychologist and then i saw like two different psychiatrist and psychologists until they came to the conclusion that they didnt believe i had bpd like how the hospital diagnosed me with that but that i did have severe ocd like they said so this really great psychiatrist did a med change and i immediately had my thoughts of suicide disappear most of them and they didnt make me freak out anymore if they showed up combined with starting dbt two months ago it worked miracles i just finished my first official semester in college and i got all as except one c i had to withdraw my first semester from most classes and get an incomplete for one class so thats why i consider this semester an official one i was really great for 2 months of course not all days will be good but i no longer felt like killing myself up until last week where i was very emotionally overwhelmed by all that had happened to me in my past and i dwelled on it and my mom is a very toxic person on me so i had a crisis and my impulse was to grab a knife and slice my throat i couldnt because i was scared and the knife wasnt sharp enough just big and then so a few days later for the same thing of being emotionally overwhelmed i impulsively cut myself two days but i talked about it in dbt therapy and i used the skills they have taught me and i got very productive i promised myself i was going to practice my guitar every day starting this week and i already learned two songs i write a lot of poetry that help express what i feel and i actually made a page because i want to make it into music and i have many designs to make clothing and i want to be recognized in the future by my writing and clothing and i want to be a voice of inspiration to others who suffer as well so i always keep that in my head that i need to grow and prosper and achieve my dreams and once i get there and if i make a lot of money im gonna fund shit for mental health and keep on trying to be a voice people can relate to or get hope from i want to prove to all the people that bullied me and treated me like shit and caused me trauma that im not just a typical whatever guy i want to be someone big and successful and i know my family isnt completely functional but i cant leave them either i would ruin their lives too so i try to remember all that stuff and even though i dwell on the past a lot and feel so much hatred and anger towards those who hurt me who are a lot of people and all i ever beg for is an apology that ill never get except for one girl i use that as motivation to make sure that im going to prove them wrong one day like muhammad ali "ima show you how great i am!" so even though i did hurt myself this last week my thoughts mostly disappeared i listen to very mellow music that makes me happy i write i play video games i work out and every day i try to achieve a goal no matter how small to feel that i am worth something and closer to growing bigger and closer to the person i dream to be thats how my suicidal thoughts have gone away but i lived hell for years specially 2016 and the beginning of 2017,0
i havent had problems with it it does so much; helps with ocd is the main thing but also with anxiety and lots of others that i dont remember right now!,1
just sick of butterflies and worrying all the time x,0
jesse is correct on the crippling effect anxiety can have a lot of times the simplest gestures to show you care are the ones that help the most,1
ive been running pretty much ever since bipolar first started to get ahold of me when i was 17-18 i go on long runs about 8 miles i built myself up to that over time but it really helps me it helps me with that manic energy it gives me 1-2 hours to also let my mind go and run through the restless thoughts afterwards the endorphins that we naturally produce from a good workout help me feel much better and accomplished running was originally my own form of self harm with the thought of if i collapse and die then thatd be a way out and ran to the point of exhaustion and muscle cramps but over time what was an unhealthy habit of self harm turned into a super positive daily routine of using that time and energy to focus my thoughts and emotions in a productive way to start my days it keeps me in good shape and has been a cornerstone of my mental health and overall well being the last 6 years ive also done things such as rock climbing hot yoga biking anything active that requires you to be in tune with your whole body really really helps me,1
im so glad i read this article i plan to subscribe to the magazine also i related to all 20 & a have a few more i have always been told that i am so negative since i was young i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of taking meds i decided to take myself of them i didnt like the way my brain felt it was almost numbing which i called zombietized i feel much better off those medications i would not recommend that others follow & copy this method when i find myself feeling like mood is hanging out to long i usually avoid socializing altogether,1
you can do this being pregnant intensifys every thing emotionally ect your scared because it sounds the father of the baby is no support to you find the people who care an love you an talk to them its scary being a first time mother but your child is a blessing an you child can change you entire world for the better keep your head up,0
i didnt work for 3 months now did very little over that period but fortunately back over past fortnight be kinder to yourself it is what it is and its horrid but it can pass sometimes it is very little victories listening to a mediation doing a childs crossword listening to your favourite comedy be kind to yourself,1
crazy irrational anti social angry impulsive hurtful flakey prone to fabricating situations in the mind based off of very little evidence and although we know the situation is not real the feelings associated with them are but yeah im nice and funny and social sometimes,0
so true derek seroquel is a two-faced monster blissful oblivion and a foggy zombie-like "life" i have to quit it too but the other neuroleptica stuff have disturbing effects too its a drag :/,0
hey-- i mean i mentioned it once to my parents because i genuinely felt i should never get better but they adamantly refused and told me i would get better i still struggle a lot in terms of mood swings (borderline personality disorder) anxiety and depression but if you make your mental health your top priority in your life you will see a drastic improvement engage in group and individual therapy be compliant with medications and dont be afraid to look for other therapy and psychiatrists sometimes it takes a while to find a good fit and thats okay!,1
bipolar heightens your senses especially hearing if you cant turn those things off get some ear plugs and go to a quiet room sometimes the noise bothering me is the first symptom i have of a hypomanic phase i know its awful try asking regular doctor for a referral of someone to go to sometimes they know who the good ones are its nothing to be scared of and youll be helping yourself and will feel so much better once youre on medication good luck and hang in there,0
its hard im struggling too the best i can say is hang in there - they keep telling me itll get better good luck (and yes i have a psychiatrist and psychologist),0
i run my families life cuz i carnt be on my own in the house or out cuz of panic attacks c,0
wow that was my first thought and the rest of my thoughts revolve around the pain i have been dealing with for more than 20 years (major depression panic attacks anxiety bipolar borderline personality disorder chronic pain suicidal thoughts) i can see how hard it is to lose someone to suicide; i too have lost people it isnt easy on either side if you havent been forced to live with these debilitating diseases/illnesses you cant possibly understand you (& others like you) who call people who commit suicide selfish can you possibly see how you are being selfish?,0
theres nothing selfish about suicide by: katie hurley "i experienced a range of emotions before making peace with the loss but one thought that never ever (not even for one second) crossed my mind was this ill-informed opinion that suicide is selfish suicide is a lot of things but selfish isn’t one of them suicide is a decision made out of desperation hopelessness isolation and loneliness the black hole that is clinical depression is all-consuming feeling like a burden to loved ones feeling like there is no way out feeling trapped and feeling isolated are all common among people who suffer from depression people who say that suicide is selfish always reference the survivors it’s selfish to leave children spouses and other family members behind so they say they’re not thinking about the survivors or so they would have us believe what they don’t know is that those very loved ones are the reason many people hang on for just one more day they do think about the survivors probably up until the very last moment in many cases but the soul-crushing depression that envelops them leaves them feeling like there is no alternative like the only way to get out is to opt out and that is a devastating thought to endure until you’ve stared down that level of depression until you’ve lost your soul to a sea of emptiness and darkness you don’t get to make those judgments you might not understand it and you are certainly entitled to your own feelings but making those judgments and spreading that kind of negativity won’t help the next person in fact it will only hurt others as the world mourns the loss of robin williams people everywhere are left feeling helpless and confused how could someone who appeared so happy in actuality be so very depressed? the truth is that many many people face the very same struggle each and every day some will commit suicide some will attempt and some will hang on for dear life most won’t be able to ask for the help that they need to overcome their mental illness",0
60mg all the way down to none i had constant anxiety,1
sure!! this website is for anyone if you have questions or if you struggle with issues or know someone who is we all have been there and we are all here for each other!!!,0
two points: 1 dont bring him to america 2 a hospital stay can only help dont fear the unknown- its all trial and error,1
i was very afraid to share this most people didnt know to the extreme i went or even that i was suffering i felt stigmatized but then i realized that there are so many out there that feel all alone like i did and a guiding hand or a shoulder to cry on could help i want to be that person it was therapeutic to share my story i cried in relief after i wrote this so much weight was lifted i pray others can have strength to keep fighting like the warriors they are,0

valerie wencka do you even know what it is to have anxiety? some peoples is worse than others and requires medication not all holistic stuff works i have bad anxiety and take 40mg of celexa and 2mg of klonopin daily the klonopin does not make me sleepy though do not see why you can not drive,1
latuda was horrible for me and listen to your body how you feel only you know,0
i believe this is true because substance abuse comes in all kinds of forms its not just drugs it can be tobacco shopping gambling drinking porno anything a person can turn into an addiction to try to mask the pain of this diseaseand i believe bi polar disease goes hand in hand with stress our society over taxes our bodies with more stress than ever before,0
try not to put to much pressure on yourself these dark times sometimes take a bit to get through you will comeout the other side baby steps dont set huge goals work towards being g m3d if that is something you are able to do you are strong,1
i wish i didnt have social anxiety even something as simple as going over for a fire and good times makes me hyperventilate and break down its so stupid,0

has anyone noticed that most people have these feelings based on a situation but due to illness have these ugly emotions of no reason at all? its horrible when they all come together for a meeting i want it all to go away,0

their are a lot of coping skills you can use for anxiety and panic attacks that work you may want to try that route first i refuse to take anti-anxiety meds i take my other meds cause i had scans done on my brain amd we got to the root of my problem its a lot of work finding what works and doesnt i will never just "trust" a doctors choice for me i research your concerns are valid,1

i have bipolar 2 and my husband doesnt its hard for him i try but its hard for me to control it sometimes i feel guilty for marrying him sometimes but he tells me he cant imagine life without me i would think it over specially if you are not fully committed yet its harder on my love ones then me at times thats why i always tell him that if it gets to be too much let me go self help comes first no matter what side your on read about it research go to a meeting called nami for info then only you can make that decision it is not easy but its worth the love ❤️ ,0
i have a number of mental health issues sever ones ones im not willing to admit publicly but i will say they impact my life greatly and the relationships i have i have sever anxiety amongst them how do i cope? truth is sometimes i cant but i have a beautiful little boy whos face lights up the moment he sees me and runs into my arms who says daddy 300 times an afternoon just because i have him that day just because his with me i live for that i fight all my problems for that i use my little one as my grounding source whenever i get too bad i think if him or look through my pictures of him remind myself life isnt all bad theyre are little things that make it all worth while my son is mine what is yours?,0

im on 50 mg now i started zoloft to help my anxiety and panic attacks and i was trying to get pregnant so zoloft was all i could safely take im 33 weeks pregnant still on it it helped me a ton ive had maybe 1 panic attack since starting it my anxiety is calmed even my depression is less im not getting as many nightmares and flashbacks now im more likely to go out of the house and do stuff now im hoping being on it now will help stave off post partum depression but my doctor is prepared just in case it still happens,1
i didnt see any symptoms at all of schizophrenia hearing voices in common with major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety,1
just remember things get better it takes time dont put too much pressure on urself try exercise if u feel up to it healthy eating think bout ur new course which will keep you busy i know it must be hard most of us been in v bad situations but it will pass try praying to god x,0
lithium made me a zombie when i took it but to let you know you are not beyond help theres other medications that help have you tried lamical? it has calmed my nerves down more than my klonopin it is for mood swings but it helps for anxiety too ask your doctor to give you a drug test that pinpoints what medication you can and cannot take that will help with what is out there it is only $20 and it will determine what you need  dont ever let anyone tell you that you are beyond help theres a lot of good in you and it brings you down to here that even if you have another dr dont get discouraged  also trying therapy will help too it will make you feel more relieved to know an unbiased person can talk to you and bring your anxiety down i hope this helps good luck,1
i am also on medication to be taken twice a day the best method i have found to help me remember is to take them at the same times everyday i take mine at noon and midnight i took effexor 150 mg it didnt help me it caused me to experience extreme anxiety and irritability these side effects were so severe that i almost lost my job hope this advice helps!,1
they used to call it manic depression when i was young and didnt understand it well i have a foster nephew who is aggressive and he has been diagnosed as bp4 its a horrible disease and can be crippling for young people it is so hard when your friends dont "get" your moods i hope you find your safe place and coping mechanisms writing is one of mine and i have 4 cats and 4 dogs they help me on my down times bless you sweety you have a struggle ahead but we have people who will listen xxx,0

when i was on it i felt the same way like a constant state of zombieness i ended up getting off of it because it made my anxiety bad but i took half of what he prescribed me it still helped me fall asleep but i didnt feel like the walking dead the next day,0
death is death whether the person dies of a heart attack stroke or suicide its still death just because a person wants to end their pain we should react differently? any time a loved one passes away its going to be difficult its going to hurt regardless most who mourn suicide struggle with their own guilt because they feel they could have helped suicide/assisted suicide is not black and white and it is not selfish- its very calculated if you have never faced death you wouldnt know the pain,0
also have mixed states and rapid cycling i am bipolar 1 my manic episodes manifest in extreme itritability and uncontrollable aggression and rage following on its heels deep depression last few months seldom normal episodes keep getting up and down,1
yup and let me second that kids are extremely hard they arent going to validate you or make your life better they can be great for couples but for many couples they cause strain med changes & adjustments? no luxury for that with kidsyou dont even go to the bathroom by yourself for a couple of years if you dont have a very understanding partner to raise the kids then youre screwed i dont know this couples exact situation but better he bring it up now rather than 5 years and two babies down the road after post partum hits hard and both are angry and sad: him from resentment and her from pain (which we all sympathize with of course thats why were here!) im hoping his text was for an open loving talk i hope the best for her-for both of them getting that text must have been so heart wrenching and im so sorry but i cant knock him for at least trying to have the discussion about his fears,0
lorasapam is a weak drug  they give xanax for that type of anxiety hun  each nerve pill or drug like that is for different things  zanax is a powerful sensitive and do not ever just stop taking it because this drug can kill you if you withdraw suddenly from it talk to your doctor it takes that anxiety right away,1
they wonder why every high profile massacre has a person with a mental disease no one listens to us they have no idea what a panic attack is on top of withdrawal feels like they could not imagine learned recently if i miss 3 appts with my doc he will not see me any more sad,0
you need to call her psych & tell them you need an emergency appt although im in australia most psychs will keep time aside for emergencies i know mine does because ive had my own appt delayed due to an emergency also if you cant get her in early enough take her to your local er for immediate mental health unit evaluation in the meantime i dont want to frighten you but with the symptoms youve described she needs immediate care does she have someone who can care for her & be with her all the time? i truly hope you find the help you need as soon as possible,0
maggots and grubs the way they move i have helminthephobia which is the fear of being eaten alive by worms,0
♡ thats my biggest fear it affecting my kids more in the long run!,0
dont do nothing for me or my anxiety 400 mg 3 times a day im start to only use it once with my xanax when i have a bad panic attack just because,1
my daughter has a reminder alarm set on her phone,0
i will admit though that breathing exercises did help when i was having an anxiety attack in jail and of course they didnt care so i didnt get any treatment i had no other way of getting any relief,1
first you talk about contributing to the conflict then you talk about being betrayed its a little contradictory its a little hard to give advice because it allows for too much speculation and assuming but this is my point of view i have ptsd anxiety and depression mental illnesses run in my family my younger sister has the same issues but also has schizophrenia and borderline personality she is always using her illness as an excuse but she may not realize it i try to give her the benefit of the doubt but i have cut her out of my life she is abusive emotionally and physically and believes that people should accept her just the way she is because thats how she was born i personally think that she should take an assessment of how she is and quit expecting people to put up with being hurt because thats just who she is im not saying this case is like that but without more information i can only go off my own experience it isnt just about others accepting you its about you accepting them as well doing things that push people away is self centered and it may be time to take an internal inventory if you want to be a part of life if you want loved ones around dont use your issus as an excuse to treat people poorly get on meds get into therapy actually care about people instead of only focusing on yourself and how you feel my husband and i have a lot of mental issues and fight constantly i know how youre feeling please understand that im not try to be a jerk just speaking from the experience of someone who has absolutely zero friends,0
welcome to the group i am bipolar have social anxiety ptsd and last week was diagnosed with stomach cancer i am scared too but keep the faith this is a good group to talk to my meds make me sick too so i keep trying new ones i have been bipolar since i was in my teens so i understand you just plz keep your faith that you will get better i do and take your meds and when you need to talk post on this page,1

im 22 the mother of 2 autistic kids under the age of 7 and i have bpd bipolar and clinical depression i wasnt forced on leave but i am on medical leave right now and honestly its the best thing thats helped me so far if you feel the need to go out and work id look around for cash jobs like yard maintenance or stuff like that and if you find yourself on a day you cant get out of bed well stay in bed guilt free dont stress about not being at work (i know its hard as fuck) but try and take it as a break from reality and responsibilities and focus your energy on healing yourself,1
slow down a little breathe dont panic understand that your fights effect your mental status talk yell cry to your therapist dont jump back in to the frying pan at least for awhile are you on meds?? with bipolar and anxiety disorders sounds like you are if not you might want to consider it with your dr now some meds can make you feel numb did for me anyway i too have bipolar and anxiety disorders along with others been on many many different med combos and have had the numbness talk with your dr/therapist let them guide you have also been in abusive relationships whether it be physical emotional or being abused mentally they all mess with your disorders clear your head before making any major decision in regards to hooking back up with him is it worth it?? you need to take care of you!! talk to yourselfask yourself questions answer yourself yes there will always be good times comforting times but keep in mind the rocky times and again ask yourself if its worth all that how much can you take?? but like i suggested talk with your dr and therapist it helps to get as much input as you can so you can choose what works for you!! i finally came to the point of saving myself from breakdown and that was after a plan of suicide good luck to you!! i hope you get alot of feedback here also youre in my prayers!! god bless!!,1
if it were that easy none of us would have anxiety disorders!,1
it would be a horror film,0
self-awareness is extremely important when fighting mental illness you can get through this cycle and you know it ride it out and think twice at every turn avoid regret you can do it!,0
this is a good option asking yourself "whats the worst that can happen?" and "so what if this happens?" until you cant produce any more issues can help you just have to make sure you do it in a safe place and have a safety plan as if you dont have practice it can lead to further panic,1
if you cant do some exercise but have you tube go on there and find jason stephenson guided meditation to anxiety go and lie down close your eyes and take some deep breaths in through your nose for say the count of four and breath out through your mouth for the count of six letting go of all that anxiety good luck phone your doctor if you need to,1
me myself the self journal helps alot this works on my spin downs keeping busy with even small projects keeps my mind contrasted off lifes coursemind games seem to work when im hipper inside im just learning this candy crush works  also i have been doing a lot of research on different ways of help i am on medications and in therapy of 14 yrs now soi could go on and on anxiety with burst of energy can be used wisely your in the right dirrectionmost wait to long to ask for advice good luck you got this ,1
i doubt that you could be med-free & fully functional long term with an illness like bipolar me i rattle like a bottle of pills when i walk and i still struggle a huge amount being off meds can cause a more severe relapse but at the same time if you are med free and coping well because you have made significant changes in your life / lifestyle to work around bipolar then there is the potential that it could work for a select few,1
i have all those same probs n i havemt taken a pill in 3+yrs my husband knows i have good n bad days but he still supports me in whatever i have to deal with if u dont like pills go natural there are tons of herbs n tinctures u can use i managed to find a few things that help without the meds its trial n error start small and try diff things till u find something that eases most of ur symptoms its ur personal choiceur life if u dont wanna take meds then dont but dont let ur bf pressure u into takin them jst cus half the meds they give u for this crap are ssris i recommend doing some research as for the rest of u ppl that keep telling her to take her meds fck u its her fckin choice uf she wants to take them or not u dont need pharmaceuticals to combat mental illnesses there are many other options she can use,1
truly didnt realize how horrible bi polar is i dont have it but my ex does good news is last i heard shes with a great guy stay healthy kat love always x,0
yes it happened to me i always worked full time two jobs single mom of the year and then like a strike of lighteningit was like the flood gates opened and my whole life fell into my lap at once i have bipolar 1 ptsd anxiety and borderline personality disorder i started medicines that seemed to help then i lost my jobs because of my irrational behavior and tardiness that was last june i literally went from being wonder woman to a shell of wonder woman i still want all those things job money social life friends and family but im crippled with irrational fears and anxieties i stay home with my kids now i try to stay busy so i dont feel so worthless i craft i force myself to make 1 phone call a day so that im not completely alone i try to make the best whats right here in my comfort zone,0
going through the exact thing right now im fortunate enough to have a dr who is really patient with me and willing to run any health test to reassure me that im ok i take it one day at a time i take deep breaths keep taking my meds talking to a mental health professional and reminding myself im not alone hang in there the one thing that has been helping me a lot lately is reminding myself that my true sickness is my anxiety disorder everything else is just false and my irrational thinking comes from my anxiety and if i am sick its normal people get sick all the time it doesnt mean youre going to die,0
i know im on rispedidol for hallucinations the comes with the depression but im not on anything for anxiety,0
when bipolar goes from paranoid state into psychosis the usual hallucinations type stuff rolls i doubt your diagnosis is going to change as youre presenting with bipolar 1 manic traits and instability of mood keep working with your doctors things will settle down soon enough,1
most teens are able to take meds and they are safe for them they dont put them on stuff like xanax because thats short term anxiety relief and can have substance abuse and dependency issues most children and teens with anxiety are put on antidepressants and they are long term and super effective ive been taking antidepressants since i was twelve (im 17 now) and they help a lot you have to figure out which medication works best and doesnt have side effects for him  im on wellbutrin  but there are other types of meds out there hope this helps ,1
it is so truelam constantly told to stop worrying about everything but they have no insight into the powerlessness of anxietyl guess thats why l work hard using the skills lve been taught and do a "workout" twice a day using my pacifica app and a great app called smiling mind they give practical helps to give me some empowerment over damm anxiety,1
hi rachel how are you?i am struggling with the terms that i have an illness as a matter of fact i hate the stereotypeas soon as the subject comes up people dont want anything to do with ya ,0
i was diagnosed younger than that with depression placed on so many different types of meds over the years went to a therapeutic boarding school that was abusive so many rehabs and other insane life events now im 32 no contact with my family the docs tell me anti depressants are bad for me i have raging bipolar type 1 w psychosis then are changing the diagnosis again now i think doctors forget that we are all individuals and cant be treated the same way the human psyche is to complex to mass diagnose every jackass doctor has a different opinion and prescription currently i self medicate by microdosing marijuana i say wtf is on my mind to anyone i talk about my feelings/problems and if people dont like it kick rocks i get where your coming from with your depression and overload of responsibilities and others n ot understanding i was there one day i just said fuck it and felt alot of anxiety go away i also eat very differently now more of a vegetarian non processed food thing going its supposed to help also idk if that helps but that thats the advice i wish i got at 21 i dont talk to anyone i did back then not sure why i cared what people thought abt me so much for whoever can message me if you ever need to talk i dont judge people,0
the seroquel gave me severe anxiety and odd dreams been off of it for 4 years and still suffer with anxiety and depression,1
i got a lot of help with anxiety and quieting the endless thinking from a book by eckhart tolle called the power of now it made a lot of sense to me and helps me to stay in the present and not worry about the future or let the past hold me back it takes some practice but for me it works good luck to everyone,1
lithium cause me to have an extreme break out and weight gain but its the only medication that i have suffered major anxiety attacks on sometimes i feel like im ugly and other days i feel pretty ive gotten to the point that i try not to look in the mirror it mostly depresses me,0
i have never been in a long term love relationship and im 37 they just last a few weeks and they cant handle the darkness so i just completely stopped looking for a partner and without any real friends around i started focusing on what i can do on my own i started on a healthy diet cooking good healthy food i go for walks every other day down by the seaside with some dark (not sad) music the sight of big waves crashing violently on the rocks calms me down as for a relationship i think it might come my way maybe not i believe stressing about it wont help me but it will drag me further deep into depression i hope my short story helped good luck ,0
i def think its way too much but you have to know your own body and by the fact yiur asking you must think so i would talk to my dr and if he wont adjust to your wants then get another we are here to live lofe not be tied and chained to meds and drs! i understand about the sleeping when i got off my meds 2 years ago that was my fear buti researched and tried other thibgs and i now sleep 5-7 hrs a night w nothing! its a daily task but i fewl so much better without all those meds their side effects and staying stressed having to remember to take them throughout the day now life is enjoyable im not just going thru the motions good luck ❤️,0
i learned that sometimes the worse places make the best jumping points it drives us to do better and be better being alone will not make your feelings and self harm disappear proper treatment will you need to use this scary places as something to drive you as you are clearly strong as fuck,0
i have autism spectrum disorder whatever that means anymore i hardly talk to many people about it because the main symptom of it is adhd which everyone seems to have these days but the big one im dealing with right now is depression and anxiety that i have had for years and years,1
i have the same issues not wanting to shower and my house is a mess i want to shower and clean but i just cant today i slept most of the afternoon like i have for the last few days i also have a 6 yr son i was trying to explain to my bf about my illness bipolar stage 2 ocd panic attacks anxiety attacks possible ptsd and he was like i dont care i dont have to deal with it,1
yes if its often enough the child us feeling fear and distress then it absolutely is traumatizing her but there are solutions and ways to repair things,0
its common to have multiple diagnosis until you get one that actually fits essentially if the treatment is working go with it i was diagnosed with depression borderline then finally bipolar and anxiety once i got my final diagnosis my meds and therapy helped things fall into place,1
akathisia a feeling of muscle quivering restlessness and inability to sit still sometimes a side effect of antipsychotic or antidepressant medication,0
im the fourth generation to have bp no children for me im afraid i have borderline personality disorder too so doubly bad it wouldnt have been fair on the kids or my husband he has enough to deal with but we just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary im sure the pressure would have blown us apart i borrow other peoples children and spend all my money on us! its great!!! go with your instinctsyoure an intelligent person ,0
but do a lot of research on strains because just like pharma meds certain strains can make life worse heres a handy website on strain info leaflycom,1
depression is not situational dependent - depression is a mental illness that can hit anyone at any age at any time there can be certain personality traits that are more susceptible or often connected to depression - however this does not mean that those without these indicators are not at risk for this illness,1
been on it for about 2 years now works well for my anxiety makes me very tired so i take it at night and let it help me get a good nights rest i do wake up feeling groggy i just give myself more time in the morning than i used to to be up and ready,1
once you come off your meds it can stay in the system for a bit im currently going without but thats because i moved and only just got round to changing doctors 5 months later! i do get very low moments and get a bit worried but im picking myself up i have found ive seperated myself from people more just want my kids around me and family im seeing a ne doctor next week though i guess you just need to be so aware of yourself and any mood change meds are not a quick fix and take a while to get into the system xxx,0
the rash is the main thing i got it but was also lowering off epilim while starting lamactil which shouldnt be mixed a while down the track im back on lamactil/lamotrogine and no rash just make sure they go very slow in raising doses it helps my mood ( im bp2) the irritability and swings but i also take zoloft for depressioni found for me it was one that didnt stack on the weight im now on 400mg 200 night and 200 morning,1
im sure that must often be the case with mental illness be it anxiety or depression or other illnesses it is really good that you can take note of the signs and use them as a warning i think people who are in a period of recovery and have learnt how to notice signs of decline triggers if you like and can then engage preventative measures to make sure you dont continue to spiral downwards but this might only be possible for people who have spent years and months working thorough all of this im trying to remember all the physical symptoms i remember of severe depression i constantly had this almost sore throat it wasnt sore but i was always aware of this unpleasant sensation a tightness all to do with the anxiety of feeling depressed and not being able to escape the nausea tightness in my chest unsettled stomach lethargy no appetite some of these things you could almost argue were not actually physical but psychological but felt physicalweird! the first time i had a panic attack i honestly thought i was having a heart attack and im no way a drama queen or a hypochondriac! yes whether it be a mental physical symptom they can be so closely linked and often chicken and egg one can lead to another and vice versa but yes i think stress in general can cause so many physical symptoms most very unpleasant thats why alone its so important to look after yourselves eat well sit in the sunshine and to do some light exercise if you can xx,0
i did miss a a dose once and it was horrible i could handle it to an extent my doctor tries to help me but sometimes i think shes tired of trying especially since im still suffering a lot from things like lack of good quality sleep extreme fatigue even though my moods are more stable she said once my moods were more stable the rest would get better and its not,0
oh dear unfortunately yes that was the reason i started to go to counselling to try and escape the numbness it was a horrid but worth while journey i have slipped many times since counselling finished but ifeel i can now manage the dark days that come along there is help out there please access it x,0
well if you have friends and theyre not supporting you in your struggles then theyre not your friends,0
im diagnosed bipolar 2 and yeah that seems pretty consistent with my days keep a journal try to keep details such as how long youre feeling a certain way how those feelings are and things you do (much like this post) the days/weeks i consider my "up" days (symptoms of mania showing) i try to channel that energy into positive things (going on a run getting school work done yard work chores piano etc) and days that im down i just acknowledge that im ok its just the disorder messing with me and mentally get myself encouraged enough to go for my run even if it turns into more of a walk or a short jog normally at least getting moving and outside kickstart my days really well and gets me over that depression hump but most importantly keep in contact with your doctor the reason bipolar is so dangerous is the "mixed" episodes that can begin to occur where you have thoughts/feelings of depression and anxiety but the energy/drive of a manic episode which turns into a combination that leads to self harm for that reason its super important to try and stay a step ahead of the disorder and work with your doc to stay as clear headed as possible during my stay in a psych hospital and therapy learning as much as i could about cognitive behavioral therapy has helped me every single day and helps me be much more independent,0
he definitely needs professional care so hospitalization may be best he is clearly not capable of taking care of himself and while its good of you to worry and obviously try to help it is beyond your ability especially if he resorts to violence putting yourself in harms way to try to protect him is doing no one any benefit,1
finding the right meds and dosages is a trial and error that everyone had to go through it can be hard and this is the phase where people sometimes give up and swear off meds all together dont give up! you will find the right ones that work for you please keep trying youre on the right track your doctor may need to perscribe a seperate anxiety medication definantly keep in contact with your doctor over the issue and keep trying things out the only real thing i can recomend from expirence is it often takes at least 1-2 weeks on any medication to see a diffrence unless the side effects are dibilitating please try and give it 2 weeks before deciding things arent working and moving on,1
this describe me i struggle but never give up!,0
when anxiety goes untreated and gets worse the next stage is paranoia you seem to be exhibiting some signs get into a psychiatrist quickly and get treatment honey,1

i was on 800mg and i felt a lot better but i did gain weight! that got me down so i came off them wasnt good so put bk on them but now on 400mg still struggle with the weight but i can now function as a human being,0
ive been off an on medications over the yrs it totally depends on my stress level at the time i never pushed my son into taking meds eitherits definitely a personal choice my son asked to try meds a year ago at the age of 16 and it was his decision and it has been helpfulhe even made the 40 honor roll for the first time even with a learning disability i have also managed a youth mental health group home for the last 13 yrs and our clients have a says in their medication management as well ♡,1
omg my periods used to be a nightmare i was an angry anxious emotional mess until i got the mirena iud it took about 6 months and then my periods stopped and i only have a little spotting sometimes its works by keeping the blood from lining in your uterus the best part is it only releases hormones into your uterus and not thru your bloodstream i used to become suicidal on any other birth control i also tried the copper iud but it made me bleed so bad they had to take it out at the er,1
tw i you are worthy no matter what your struggles are; you are worthy our society tell us to look at the big contribution that an individual makes but i suggest that you look at the small ones you very presences lights up somebodies day; makes them feel like going on yes you are worthy and beautiful,0
change is uncomfortable even if its for the best i had to learn that when staying hurts more than leaving then youre ready to go even when you question yourself good luck to you,0
they have to have one of their doctors verify and confirm the full extent of ur mental illness and to what degree everything appears ie:slightmildacute average moderate duel purpose diagnosis severe extreme when u go to eval be completely honest no adlibs no over/under exaggerated dont leave anything to their interpretation take meds as prescribed on day of eval find some self moderation exercises that actually works use affirmations to alleviate anxious/fear relax be urself dont think about things too much or too little if u dont understand a question ask for clarification before answering take ur time its not good to rush this eval say a prayer to ur higher power of u have one to help u stay calm cool and collected dont stress too much remember this is only one step to self reliance keep up the fight and u will succeed #breakthestigmaofmentalillness,1

weekly therapy proper medication can improve depression dramtically(no shame in medsdont let anyone tell you this theyve saved my life) i am recovering cutter too ive actually at my worst cut the word alone into my arm because ive felt very much like you my coping me hanism is i take a sharpie and write messages to myself on my arm such asstay strong or have hope i also wear two bracelets that i never take off that say hope and warriorknow youre not alone i dropped all religion when in phsch ward best thing i ever did if it makes you feel bad about yourself it needs to gojob family religion etc its not easy to do trust me i know dont speak to parents andrecently gave up good paying job to flip burgers but guess what my old manager was a an asshat who insulted me daily and now im both free and happier its a lifelong struggle andtheyll always be bad days but it does get better with proper treatment and medication you are loved and matter to me even though i dont know you i understand,0
that sucks cause same thing happened to me was on the 30mg for less than 2 weeks ans i couldnt even tolerate itrage agitation and worse anxiety:( wasnt sure whether the dose was too small or just it plain didnt agree for mein the past pristiq and effexor worked ok so thought this one would too,1
i have it started off ok but as it just stops the physical symptoms i found it was no longer working for me may have given me depression as a side effect the dr said i could choose whether to continue or not so now just take it when a panic attack comes on works pretty quickly to stop them,1
coming from where he is i would say practice self love for yourself! if you two are meant to be then time will tell at some point you have to decide if giving your all is healthy for you he needs now support but it comes from medical professionals he is unable to make life decisions and he may push you away b/c he feels like letting you go is loving you i know thats why i did with so many in my past he is doing what he needs for himself right now and i understand all the investment you have made for your relationship but you must also decide if giving is best for you! you must self love first then love someone else i have pushed my husband so many times to divorce me b/c i felt sorry for him he is now learning self love and my guilt has lessen when i see him caring for not just me but himself its still a struggle most days but i do put him first at times to even our relationship no co-dependency anymore i hope this helps god bless you for your ❤️ and for loving him now its time to love yourself and that will help you decide whats best for you too not just him,0
im on a constant roller coaster im glad i have a boyfriend who loves me and is very understanding he just went through the first episode with me yesterday of a bad anxiety attack i took my meds but i needed to be outside of course it was raining but i had to get away there were to many people in the house and i was feeling closed in when i thought i was feeling better i went to set with him and i wasnt feeling better he had everybody leave he just held me and talked me through it and well the rest of the night was amazing he is the best i love him so much i couldnt ask for anyone better,0
seroquel=weight gain for me it meant lots of weight gain i gained a little over 100 lbs in a little over a year stopped gaining as soon as they took me off but now stuck with 100 unwanted pounds that im struggling to lose sad part is that seroquel is the only med that ive felt actually helped :-(,0
im so sorry you feel that way no one should live with constant fear and anxiety counseling helps i hope you can get the help you need,1
they use drugs like limictil and tegratol which are anti seizure meds but for mood stabilizer they slow down the brain enough it stabilizes mood so it doesnt matter if you have one or two im on tegratol and it has saved my life nothing else has ever worked so well if youre doing well i wouldnt worry about it,1

first of all if you can you need to go and fight this out at your pharmacy and have them correct the problem this has happened to me before but the pharmacy will be shaken by you confronting them about you going cold turkey off your meds you cant and shouldnt do thus it is very dangerous if its there screw up they need to fix it but deal with them face to face good luck,1
its very important especially wth bi-polar with panic attacks/anxiety and depression that you take your medication that works right for you do never throw yr meds away and stop you will eventually go worse till its very serious situation stay well and take your medication without fail,1
i am on cilift it makes my hair fall out and puck up wight but it helps me deal with my depression and anxiety so its really minor issues,1
i worry pro-actively things that i know are never going to happen get a fair amount of my "black dog"  obsessive anxietywhatever youd like to call it,0
i would talk to your dr about an adjustment if you are already out of your medication either you need a higher dose or something else because while some anxiety meds are "as needed" antidepressants are taken regularly at the same time same time every day to be effective either way please talk to your dr because you dont have to suffer!,1
you cannot i stress cannot be held responsible for the actions of somebody else her self harm is her choice you didnt make her do it you need to be strong for you not her,0
meds will affect people in different ways it is a great idea to keep a journal when you start a new med to chart what is happening that way you can let your doctor know of any severe side effects and as i have stated before google effexor and get all the info you can as well as all the info on all your meds keeping track of what has and hasnt worked is very important as well as why you stopped a medication i started effexor in november and no one told me about the night sweats i also got a cool med dispenser from amazon that allows me to set up my meds for the week but has individual containers labeled for each day the container has little compartments for morning noon evening and bedtime meds i adjusted it for when i need to take my meds and set an alarm on my phone and it has worked out perfect almost no missed meds,1
i was diagnosed with bipolar ii about a year ago i have been on meds since i was a teenager but i have never been on the right combo of meds my psychiatrist is in the process of switching up my meds right now i am thankful that i have been able to be on medication i had such horrible depression anxiety mania and anger before medications it is totally worth it to be on the right meds! the only downside is finding the right combination of meds it takes 2-3 months for the meds to kick in completely hope you can get the right combo of meds!,1
loester 24 i have the least amount of hormonal swings and have no side effects bipolar anxiety and depression is what im treated for the nuvaring also worked well,1
im glad you made this statement i always wonder if meds are good for me or not i think it depends on the severity of your illness some people are born with it and really just have to learn to cope therapy and medication help those individuals but my mother believes in trying to better your state of mind naturally whether its waking up early amd starting a routine cleaning exercise arts and crafts changing your lifestyle to where you are a little more productive can make a big positive change in your life when im active im happier when im not i se to dwell on negitivity for me its jist a battle of staying active staying positive i tale meds no therapy but i do lots of arts and crafts,0
same here and im literally still shaking my legs my mom used to put her hand on my knee to help me stop but i couldnt all my boyfriends notice it when ee are in bed i attempted suicide on it as well due to ither circumstances at yhe time also but i actually went through with b yhe attempt still have the scar my impulse control was null and void and i was agitated all the time school was next to impossible to deal with and im still lost as ever,0
prudence lowe benjamin its pretty safe as far as any research ive done on it for adults anywaysim 85 months pregnant and my obgyn told me the only real risk was cleft palate and a minuscule risk of a heart murmur but nothing to worry about i still didnt like the idea of the risks and weaned myself off asap but it was too late and my daughter has to be born at a special hospital because she has 6 severe heart defects and two organs are in the wrong place i did more research on my lamictal and effexor with pregnancy effects and sure enough effexor is a lot worse than they said it was can even cause part of the babys skull and brain to be completely missing or formed outside of the body its horrible for babies but so far still seems pretty safe for adults,0
ooo i should know better we are all entitled to our own experience and that is mine i am not the only one who does this every single day regardless of what my bipolar tells me im capable of the bipolar is not the boss of me im the boss of it i dont allow myself to stay in bed no matter how much i want to i keep my irrational temper to myself because i know intellectually im being irrational i very clearly see what the bipolar is doing to me and i fight it tooth and nail every second of every day and when i get tired and want to give up i put on my big boy pants and move on so go ahead and judge me,0

im in sydney australia and your experiences are all too familiar i presented to er and i waited in their interview room for over 18 days only to be told if im asking for help im not at risk of suicide i told them not to do a home visit because i didnt want to upset my father and well 10 days later they arrived on the doorstep on a day that i dragged myself to work in the hope of trying to drag myself out of my depression they told my father everything breaking confidentiality and told him i was an attention seeker years later i called again because my psychiatrist was overseas for 8 weeks and i was told if i could afford psychiatrist i didnt need the public system and that was it im now lucky to have a bipolar i diagnosis im medicated correctly and im able to hold down a job which means i can afford private health insurance meaning im covered for a psych unit people say our system is great and sure everyone is covered but there arent enough resources to go around and the people running them dont have a clue i really dont know what to say except i have some understanding my suggestion is to find a new dr if you can i understand your social phobia may stop that what about a dr that visits your home? we have those in sydney also ring the acute care again and say that you need to have a case worker and a referral to a psychologist they might be happy to transfer you to case management gets you off their books i really hope you can get some help soon you are doing the best you can and that is all kids need to know,0
its really hard for people to understand also specially men when they dont have what we have i just realized now 41 years old why i can stay stay when a relationship and its because no one understand and mens try to control my life when they see me those days really depressed or without motivation they take advantage and situations that we pass like anxiety so i realize that its better to be by myself right now that im not ready anymore to people try to control my life i feel like i own my own self and if someone is not happy with me and im not happy with that person i appreciate to be by myself and keep it moving forward i feel like i know how to control my emotions better when im alone then when i have someone i get very exciting when i meet people and at the end of the day everything is going away so why try again im happy right now when i have a man i get very depressed i feel they demand for too much and i dont like when people start criticizing me you can do this you could do that that they said i had to be in bed you dont even know me it can be like today a beautiful day but i feel a little drowsy i would love to be sleeping right now but i can have to do responsibility but right now no one is telling me not to do my responsibility if i wanted to i dont have to do it i dont do it but if i would have a man he would be in top of me bothering my head and i really dont want to do that anymore my life i prefer to taking care of my son 11 my dog and continue looking for god thats what i want,0
i wont i already trird that and it didnt work and im afraid if i do ill lose him as a friend,0
i was told years ago that i was too sensitive; they have no idea that she permanently did damage to a fragile mind it ultimately helped induce the paranoia /ptsd i now have to fight against everyday no i havent forgotten  ill never forget all of it,0

im in the houston tx area where we have hurricane harvey i talked to my drs office yesterday before they closed at noon because one of meds i dont have enough to get me through this mess because its a free clinic thats where i also get my meds from their pharmacy but the pharmacy is already closed so there is no access until this hurricane is over and that could be for days im in this apt with a disabled vet who also has ptsd weve had some interesting times of his ptsd mixed with my bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd mostly we are able to laugh and joke  but if you could please keep us in your prayers im a little nutty right now!,1
listen to everyone on here who tells you they go through this/have gone through this too theyre not lying and look how many there are!! youll find your place i was so alone at 17 too only in my 30s did i meet my "tribe" of true friends until then i desperately tried to make people like me and made terrible relationship choices i wish id just spent that alone time being glorious "me" hang in there,0
it destroyed my appetite for the first month or so otherwise ive had no side effects and it seems to be helping im back to enjoying little things in life and my hobbies i dont know about its effect on anxiety bc i take other stuff for that also i have less back pain which the doctor said could be from this medicine the downside i guess is that if i forget a dose then i start to feel very uncomfortable about 12 hours after the missed dose it feels like electric currents are discharging in my head and face but ive had this happen with several antidepressants ive been on antidepressants since i had an eating disorder in high school over ten years ago and this medicine seems to be the best yet or at least a close second pristiq was good too but sooooooo expensive if your insurance isnt great then check the good rx website they have like coupons and stuff for all sorts of meds,0
puppies are great! one would help with stress youre used taking care of someone trust me i know how it feels so sorry for your loss and may god bless you,1

your boss is a jerk who needs to be educated about depression and anxiety there are good people who understand you and can help please dont give up ,1
its so awkward sometimes to forget little things,0
im sorry you had such a bad experience mine was different staff was fantastic i went home on fewer meds than i went in with they didnt want us on phones so that we would be present in the healing process - it was a way to sever ties with outside stressors and provide a safe space the food was decent we had appointments with a nurse a social worker and a psychiatrist daily as well as group we wore street clothes not hospital gowns (laces and strings in hoodies removed no belts or scarves) but we didnt get fresh air if anyone besides kalissa reads this please know that experiences differ by hospital and it may not be an awful experience each program is different i actually miss my time there,0
i am on prazosine for my ptsd it is helping but stress does work against me what i need to do is start a bed routine where i take my meds about 2 hours before i needs to go to sleep then no tv or stressful or mind activities like games on my phone or tv quiet music and reading and snuggles with my kitty are perfect meditation with 4 - 7 - 8 breathing is one i am working on stopping watching tv is a hard one for me though i know it is tough to shut our minds off mine will not without medication sometimes i will think of a story to tell myself and then just work on it night after night it usually relaxes me and puts me to sleep,1

so simple and so cheapcelestial seasoning sleepy time tea im not exaggerating it works as well as any sleeping pill ive taken without any side effects i was most recently on restoril and it worked but it was literally making me sick so i decided to stop taking it i was terrified of not being able to sleep and my psychiatrist asked me to just give the tea a try with my regular night time meds it knocked me out all night i woke the next morning completely shocked that i had sleptwith no nightmares i couldnt remember anything just deep warm relaxed sleep and i had no morning migraine or nausea like every other day on restoril its amazing but i guarantee you 999% docs are not going to suggest it cost $398 for a box of 20 worth twenty times that! good luck ,1
i worked in mental health care for 10 years and was very good at my job but between mental illness job stress and events in my life i was rendered a mess that can barely take care of himself yet alone others im disabled now all i can advise is to get a support network of friends and family and get meds and therapy and try to work through this i havent lost hope that i will get back to where i used to be,0
im so sorry that your feeling this way it must be exstreamily overwhelming i hope that you start to feel better in this tough time and realise that you and your life is more precious than you think keep going stay strong ,0

i was om almost the same cocktail and when they introduced latuda for my attitudea i didnt want to live i walk from room to room confused feeling so uncomfortable in my skin and thinking if this was life i dont want it no latuda for me and the seroquel gave me night terrors if i stayed awake too long,0
same i dont really get angry tho more like overwhelmed when its really bad for me i feel like it also just sucks the life out of everyone around me and i feel like such a monster that i want to run and hide from everyone the emptiness and depressed feeling can be so crazy when i get into that wanting to end it all state of mind its not that i actually want to end it all i just wish my feelings and thoughts would silence themselves for once ,0
hmmi doubt itll work in my case,1
my daughter started on fepakote at age 16 she did ok but when she started lithium things changed for the better even she recognized the change and gets upset if a dr wants to take her off lithium everyone and every md is different,1
yeah if you wanna get pregnantthatll sure change tomorrow no doubt,1
it is never ok ever the family/friends left behind will be scarred for life suicide is a selfish act there are resources reach out to them not every day is a good day not every day is a bad one either the struggle is real the fight is hard find your resources and keep going it might be exhausting but keep going anyway do not ever be afraid to ask for help keep going right ciara mary voelker?,0

that is a lot of pressure to be under looking for a new job is extremely stressful what you are going through is normally very challenging to someone not on meds you should talk to your dr about adjusting your meds and get to a therapist so you can talk through what is going on in your life,0
i was suffering depression and anxiety was at the point of a breakdown it did take a while to work though,1
seroquel makes my restless leg syndrome unbearable and i also have an anxiety disorderthinkin about whether i can get some sleep makes it worse ,1
very hard to deal with makes you feel ashamed cause you come on too strong and then that gives you a reputation and so that turns you into a recluse or an outcast of sorts who still has good in your heart but instead of wasting anyones time or being put through the ridicule of it all again and again youre left alone to face youre bi-polarizing thoughts all that time and youre sexual urges which leads to chronic masturbation best thing is find a sex addict program which isnt easy people are really hard on those of us who have this and while it is a part of bi-polar it can co-develop from childhood abuse too or you can be born very hypersexually activemeaning having the sensuals of it at a very young age and not really knowing why or what to do with them they have medication if you look it up also and have doctors to speak with,0
its the truth some days i have to fight myself to be there for my kids its a struggle but i have back up plans when there is a need for help,0
remember everyone has a different response to medication we all are biologically different thats why different medications are made i have read the posts below that said effexor was horrible for them for me it saved my life no side effects i am 48 and am bipolar i have taken it around 7 years the important thing if you are bipolar is that you must also take a mood stabilizer such as lithium or lamictal with it or you will go manic taking any antidepressants by itself best of luck!,1
so true it sucks and its miserable my mind works against me its hopeless,1
sometimes depression causes anxiety so maybe starting on an antidepressant would be best just tell them all your symptoms your feelings your questions and your concerns tell them what your treatment goals are too,1
yeah i mean i was on it years before this but i had the xr version and i think its better if you have that one but the regular seroquel is scary! gave me panic attacks! and dude thats really scary im sorry that happened to you glad your mom was there to help!,0
seratonin syndrome put me in the hospitali felt horrible and had terrible side effects,0
unfortunately some times its the only way chin up things will get better talk about ptsd meds there a blood pressure med helps sometimes,1
i too am struggling and i know its scary no one understands and you feel yourself slipping medication is scary scary to need it scary side effects scary that you might not be able to function without it once established but i can tell you this i struggle with my damn meds every day but without them i wouldnt be here as for counseling or therapy it does not make you crazy or weak or any thing other than aware you need someone to talk to! your mother comes from a different generation with a different spin ignore her get the help you need,0
if you have tried every way you can think of to inform this person of what your condition is about (i find the memes and such can be an easy and helpful way to explain things sometimes) and they just refuse to understand or believe you then to me they would be toxic and i would remove them from my life if down the road they have educated themselves and want to be a positive impact on my life i would start out slowly rebuilding that relationship i have lost a lot of "friends" and most of my family because they dont believe what bipolar disorder/depression and anxiety are it is my opinion that those who truly love and care for you will make the effort to learn about the condition how to treat you and support you with your condition just as they would with anybody that has an invisible condition like heart disease lung disease etc having a "broken brain" as i call it is serious and you dont need toxic people in your life life is too short and being stable is a hard place to get to you want to enjoy being stable and having a life again you cant do that with toxic people in your life just my opinion,0
i have bipolar and my husband was in the army 23 years i totally know where youre coming from i do suggest anxiety medicine take it day by day hour by hour and minute by minute you can do this,0
50 mg is usually starting dose def talk w dr go to psychiatrist not family dr also try to find dr who is updated on newest research on bipolar spectrum the latest diagnosis in new dsm5 is major depression w mixed episode which means mood swings basically important cuz lots of people get diagnosed w depression/anxiety for yrs b4 a dr sees that its really a mood disorder which medicstion is different that just an anti depressant usually a mood stabilizer is added and works wonders but if this is first time on meds u prob on way too low dose of zoloft,1
if you only get to see the doc for 15 minutes id say that isnt acceptable it takes some time to listen to your symptoms and see if you are doing better i am not a doc either but checked with a pharmacist friend he feels its definitely possible you are being overmedicated and your doc is just throwing more meds at you instead of better meds that work ask that doc exactly what each of them is for ritalin? it rarely works to stop racing thoughts and anxiety find out what each is for tell doc that the combo isnt working for you and ask about alternatives do your own research too look up each of the meds and empower yourself with knowledge,1
how can i sleep though when all my anxious thoughts come rushing back at bed time ttatt,0
i suffer from anxiety and depression its a everyday struggle to put on a fake smile! pretend to be a little happy so no one says wow shes a b:t($ bc most days thats how i feel like a grade a (b) bc im so done with people and their ways,0

when things get bad i write every thought downno matter how cluttered or irrational getting it all out really helps sometimes ill write more than 20 pages in my journal one sentence after another not thinking about what im writing but writing what im thinking i ended up finally having the confidence of reading some to my shrink so she would understand how my head was working during issues after about 6 months i started being able to cope a lit better because i wasnt holding anything in anymore which made it possible to process and move forward,0
dont give us a placebo give us a fucking cureive tried so many medications nothing relieve s the pressure in my head,1
its a great medication here and there side effects and yes i have gained almost 40 pounds myself  it helps with schizophrenia anxiety  helps you sleep kinda for me and helps with depression  etc ive been on it for a year im on 400 mg  also im on other differ types of mental illness meds i am still struggling best of luck to you,1
last time i had a massive panic attack there was nothing around me to cause it my husband and i were watching disney movies on the couch and i was browsing pintrest for diabetic friendly recipes for dinner with my grandparents it was a nice quiet night the panic attack slammed into for no reason my husband was sound asleep at the time but im sure he heard the panic in my voice all i said was his name not even loud just normal volume which usually he wakes up for nothing i could tap dance on his head and he wouldnt wake up but he heard me say his name was instantly awake and getting up i said i needed him to hold me and instantly he was next to me holding me tight while i clung to him didnt say a word til i started to let go of the death grip i had on his shirt which meant i was starting to calm down and then all he asked was what caused it im grateful he will always help me and i can calm down just with him holding me,0
doesnt sound like its worth sticking around you need someone one who loves you for who you are what you go through and how hard it is to function im in the same boat with you and am at the point where id be better off alone just havent figured out how to be brave enough to do 8 no love no compassion no empathy i already feel like im living by myself just with a stranger in the house im lonely and scared good luck to you and god!!,0
