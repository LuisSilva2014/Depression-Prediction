i have bipolar one borderline personality disorder temporal lobe epilepsy adhd ptsd and ocd at the moment the docs are only treating my epilepsy as i have had a spike of bad seizures that we cant get under control so they have stopped my bipolar meds im coping okay just not sleeping so im really touchy and grumpy im struggling with routine as i am studying and cant seem to get my head in the game when it comes to sitting down and hitting the books but i will keep trying and always keep fighting i hope things come right for you just have faith faith that you will overcome because life says that you should never be ashamed of your scars because they show that you were stronger than whatever tried to hurt you be strong,0
much the same as that plus fear and desperation,0
its very common to struggle with work im not a great employee it doesnt take much to tap out,0
it could but the horror of it all is that you carry this darkness around all the time and there are many moments when all of that stuff doesnt matter to you anymore i understand everyone has some type of problem in life but i would honestly rather be homeless and starving than deal with the shit that goes on inside my mind 24/7,0
dont feel shame that only allows the illness to win if it bugs you say something!,0
i carry the weight for 2 of my friends the first one talked to me that night and was explaining some of the problems going on in his family  and was saying his sister wanted to commit suicide he went home after taking me home and hung himself i feel like i could of done more knowing he was feeling that way i would of never left him my second friend had some issues he called me the day before and asked me if i could give him a reason to live and we were entertaining the idea of a relationship but he was hung up on some one else and couldnt move on he wanted me to want him and i pushed him away and he killed hisself im drowning in the guilt i dont know how to stop blaming myself,0
when my psychologist suggested i should go to a clinic for bipolar depression and anxiety i was sceptical at first but things just got worst for me to the point where i would impulsively think of ways to kill myself but i went and it was the best thing i ever did you have to do it for yourself because you cant be a good mother for your kids if you dont children are resilient they bounce back quicker than you thinkbeing sick is not your fault and you need to get to grips with that and youll get the assistance and proper medication you need to live a fuller life i was ashamed about my sickness until i realised its not my fault today i have the courage to tell people about my sickness and it doesnt bother them as much as i thought it would they are more surprised and want to know more about it,0
are you having any other symptoms it could be anxiety,1
ps ive had severe anxiety depression sociophobia and very severe insomnia for several years (reason private) having a lot of professionals involved in my case a wonderful support worker amazing support from one special friend who shopped cooked and cleaned for me as well as 4 surgeries 18 months ago and was almost successful with a suicide attempt about 6 weeks ago heigh-ho :/,1
effexor can give u adrenaline rushes i was put on neulactal to stop them just get regular blood pressure check ups,1
i totally relate to what you are feeling there is no easy solution at least that im aware of im still fighting through a depression and anxiety that has left me disabled the best advice i can give you is to stay close to those few that understand and really try to build a support network that helps lift you up when you cant walk on your own and try to believe that one day you are going to feel better,0
i have no one to stay with me im scared for myself,0
i have rapid cycling bipolar i think everyone with bipolar has the chance of a sudden rapid cycling (circumstances environment moon phase time of year hormones) if its not normal for you then makes someone close to you aware of whats happening its hard to keep track and you will not see the shift yourself its okay just breathe if thats all you can do concentrate on that and the loud fast rushing will get quieter if you havnt experienced it before it is very frightening try writing whenever you can then when your well sift through it all you will remember the days and maybe be able to start identifying sign and your own red flag behaviours that signal a change i hope someone close is helping you through try and keep people in your loop take care l x,1
youll get through it itll take some time but youll get through it its not meant to be easy talk to your psych and see if he/she can give you anything for the panic attacks each session gets "easier" as you work through things and talk to your boss and let him know what youre dealing with when i finished my last in-patient time and had to go to php i came home the same way you described and it was hell and that was seven days a week so no breaks at all it sucked but it got easier as time went on (not trying to compare my situation to yours just trying to say i know where youre coming from),0
nicole i would love a life without meds but my life was not what i wanted it to be without meds i have come to accept that i will always be on meds the depression would eat me alive i dont try to push just letting people know my experience on the meds im on or have been on i have biplor ii the irritability and rage was too much for me to handle on my own good luck to you whichever road you choose ,0
i know what its like to wake up every morning wishing you hadnt nobody understands unless they go through it it was my little boy that kept me going i could never have left him and the thought of what it would do to him he would have been the one to find me as im divorced and we live alone but i can promise you that it will get better once youve got on the right medication things will change just hang in there and focus on your little one he/she is worth living for like the other lady said  if you feel that you will be a threat to yourself go to a&e your little one needs you and so does everyone else we can beat bipolar and we will!! x,0
hi there ive been on them for depression there an ok tablet not on anything at the moment  it helps me to keep stress out of my life x,1
i left my job because i was just to tired in the morningits not like i sleep late or sleep to littleeven with 8 hours of sleep waking up for me is dreadful,1
i used to suffer multiple suicidal thoughts every single day for over 30years and sometimes i would act on them i am also borderline and bipolar with adhd since being on seroquel (quetiapine) i can go months without the thoughts and when i do get them they are only fleeting it has been pure bliss not having that daily struggle i still hate me but seroquel has been a godsend for alleviating those thoughts i also started lithium 4 months ago to help alleviate the ups n downs of bipolarso far so good,1
but nobody ever talks about hypersexuality as a symptom mostly out of shame,0
2! some days im great and my ocd kicks in and others im going crazy cuz my ocd kicks in but my bpd episode of the day wont let do anything anxiety on top of depression,0
call the drug companies they quite often have a plan that will work for you if nothing else they will reduce the cost of your meds then go to the state and stay there until someone listens to you!!! withdrawals are horrible and if it gets too bad head for the er their social workers usually have someone or something that will work for you god bless my friend ill be thinking of you,1
never be scared to tell them i told my boyfriend before we even started dating that i have severe anxiety disorder and depression,1
doesnt sound like its you in this situation if he has a girlfriend but is not s cheater he probably shouldnt be hanging around you if hes got feelings anyhow when im in an episode i talk super fast but then start to stutter i get very irritated by that but that makes it worse i end up doing s mental breathing moment and it gets a little better you could say to your friend that not everyone has the same life experiences just breathe a little,0
would probably say number 3 i do find it hard to concentrate feel tired sometimes and suffer with anxiety if i need to do something different or have to attend something that i am not comfortable with,0
1 without question or hesitation anxiety and chronic nerve joint and back pain keeps me from getting decent sleep most of the time,1
tell them trust me it was the hardest but best thing i ever did was to ask for help and accept that i am the way i am i still struggle but i have some support now i still have days i wish people didnt know as i am paranoid that people will talk about me and think im weak but they cant help if they dont know we are fighters not failures and you can do this doesnt matter if it happens now or after a break if you need time to rebalance it should be treated no different to if you broke your arm or had a physical illness xx,0
im so sick of closed minded people who have no idea what it is to suffer from mental issues nobody asks for this n if your not a person with a illnesses or a doctor youll never understand my heart has become hardened to this world i suffer from bipolar depression anxiety and have border line personality disorder and a schitso affective i spell horribly sorry my point is i have become very blunt n honest i tell ppl this upfront cuz i dont care what you think of me im me n cant change that if you cant deal with it theres the fn door n get out of my life dont be ashamed for who you are and remember you are not alone n although we dont know each other personally i am allways here to listen to someone who is struggling mentally best of luck,0
ive never really "dated" so i dont know how that works ive never been in a relationship with someone who wasnt a friend first even if there had always been a romantic intent from the beginning (by my own choosing i feel more confident in a person if i know them as a friend) therefore my previous partners all knew about my mental health issues a long time before they stepped into a romantic relationship with me what you need to be prepared for is that sometimes even the most well intentioned people will not understand the truth of how these issues will effect both of you and your relationship you can give full and honest disclosure yet the rose coloured blur of new love will sometimes cloud a new partners judgement making them think that "love conquers all" and then when the dark and honest truth unveils itself it comes as a shock or a nasty scare dont blame yourself for that allow both you and your partner everything you need to learn how to deal with it together and how to look after yourselves through the ups and downs x,0
i also do the gagging and throwing up when i have anxiety i try to ground myself and think of the positive stop it youre in my thoughts and prayers hugs peace ✌️,1
hell no! im in australia the uks treatment of the clinically insane scares me,0
funny and scary - body jumper make sure u have subtitles,0
wow so fucking truewhy do we do this? is there treatment for it without meds? or naturally? if not can i ask what meds are prescribed? sorry for all the questionsmeds from big pharma scare me to death,1
this is me i also talk out loud when i dont mean to mostly when im upset,0
i hate these scare tactics,0
damn i wish that nobody had mental or emotional illnesses! i understand you guys! its so difficult to deal with bipolar disorder and with depression on a day to day basis! i just wish that nobody would suffer from that! its just horrible!,0
propranolol is fab - it saved my life simple it just stops my blood pressure rising which prevents my anxiety from getting out of control  it just  stops its like flicking a switch  bliss i take one every morning and it gets rid of  conservatively speaking - at least half my anxiety symptoms on a normal day i experience almost no noticeable symptoms whatsoever of course some days are more stressful than others and some situations are more stressful than others - so if i know i am going somewhere that im not going to like very much then a very low dose of diazepam takes care of most of the other symptoms i can work i can play i can have a life i teach  i can stand up in front of a class  when i was at my worst i could barely leave the house propranolol brought me back im a fan[caveat: my anxiety is related to the bp2 and combat-related ptsd so advice may vary according to circumstances however the propranolol helps nicely with the hypomania from the bp2 *and* the hyper-vigilance of the ptsd],1
unfortunately yes it is a struggle every day to get myself to believe i am worthy and doing ok and this is on my meds before i found this combo of drugs i felt exactly the same as you  and it doesnt matter how many people tell me i am special i hate myself and the last time i was sick i had to quit a job i had worked hard to get and had worked towards for over 10 years  which now i regret and wish i had been able to cope and be normal then so i could keep working there now i dont have a job we barely scrape by and i feel so guilty that my illness caused this anyway so sorry you are feeling this way i understand completely where you are coming from so i am not going to tell you to buck up as i know you cant  i am just going to say i understand and i care <3,0
remember things get better we all had similar experiences try doing a little more each day things that u like try see positives each day stay away from stress pray to god x,0
i have a daughter 2 granddaughters 1 adhd grandson 5 nieces we are all bipolar its so very hard to live a life of bipolar illness no one understands what you go through each day as a bipolar person i do not know what to expect from myself each day i wake up i hide my feelings most of the time so no one worried about me id go to take a shower so i could hide my feelings so many other things i do! if everyone could just try to understand who i really am! no matter how much im loved i feel unloved most of the time!,0
funny you should mention that currently im on epilim for ptsd but found its shot my vision however i was trialled on ritalin once by my old psychiatrist but couldnt get my script refilled so far (due to having to change psychiatrists and this one preferring epilim) but when i did try it short term it both fixed my fatigue and apathy massively and slowed down my bpd and ptsd thought processes (including flashbacks) and forced me to be in the moment and mindful; so it definitely helped me massively now its just a struggle as my psychiatrist has advised me ill need to see a private psych on the side to get my benzos and ritalin managed because they arent allowed to (nor comfortable with) prescribing either same goes for my gp,0
ive been living with bipolar disorder chronic depression extreme anxiety adhd insomnia ocd bpd ptsd and self harm since i was 5 i am now about to turn 34 i have no memories of a "normal" life because i was born this way and it showed up early in my life i have been on every medication i have had unsuccessful ect i have been hospitalized a few times and seen countless therapists and psychiatrists the side effects of meds have almost driven me insane i used to be embarrassed about my mental illnesses but am trying to become and advocate for it i am resistant to all treatments i havent found much of anything that helps but i have seen people get help and i have seen people be able to cope with it! be as honest as you can with the friends and family you do have i have been torn down by so many people i love but i am choosing to be a warrior and fight this damn battle until one of us is dead! its scary cause even as i write this i am suicidal and have a razor in my lap ready to make some more scars i know that sounded not hopefully but its meant to show i have a long way to go but look how far i have come!!! everyday is different and a struggle and honestly just plain hell panic attacks always feel like your dying no matter how many you have! medications can be helpful you just need to find the right combo for you specifically its a challenge but hang in there see your psychiatrist regularly and keep a journal of how you feel everyday not just oh good or bad rate your anxiety from 1-10 and your depression etc then you can see what maybe is working and maybe what is not see a therapist often especially in the beginning talk about any and everything no matter how dumb or insignificant or embarrassing it might be you can learn some coping skills to help aid the meds i believe in you! you can do this! if i can you can! it seems to me the people with mental illnesses are strong they just need to find that strength within them!! hang in there recovery is a process not and event!,0
it must feel terrible and very overwhelming keep communicating how you are feeling and be kind to yourself if you a struggling seek professional help xxx,0
or the time i had sex in the living room with a marine and all of a sudden the lights came on and i realized he was filming it ive never been so worried in my life and that was nearly 30 years ago,0
i use cannibis for my bad days i dont smoke it i eat it cook it into stuff that i can munch on with out going nuts it helps so much especially since i dont use it to get high just to help sleep or take care of the bad days i have depression anxiety and bipolar,1
i took it and it made my hypomania worse i was evil ive had sleep paralysis in the past and its terrifying,1
i am fearfully and wonderfuly made i am me and god loves me,0
all i can say that bye losing a girlfriend recently dont worry she didnt die she simply left me since that time including your truly heartbreaking story i now understand so much more believe me when i say to you thankyou and bless you,0
my weight gain was minimal to the point of non mentionable but the breast changes were awful led to a serious breast infection and cancer scare :( otherwise though it was a great fit drug wise,1
i know the gym has been mentioned i gone to the gym for 19 years it the best angry release start off slow if you cant join a gym youcan always take long walks you can adjust your diet too it makes a big difference try meditating it will be hard a first but your mind will get used to itput on some relaxing music it well calm the mind take baths cover your head with a beany  they say that some mental illness are due to some abnormal swelling in the head go in side a sana or steam room try taking coconut oil ginger  sperilina omega to help with the swelling of the head if you can get accupuntureor massage to reduce the tension  yoga  steraching journaling has help me track my triggers i just send my self text message to track my triggers and talk about it with a therapist aroma therapy essential​ oils to calm the mind,1
i had a similar reaction to all the meds i was given i came off all meds about a year agoit was really hard as it made me really ill even with doctors supervision since then i have cbt cognitive behavioural therapy i make fruit smoothies with as many antioxidants frits as i can i also add protein powder on top of that i walk 2/3 hours a day eat small amounts of red meat lots of veggies i have regular blood tests to make sure my body has enough vitamin dc and ion ext i have never felt so good i know its still early days but i find the more natural i keep my diet it really helps my moods the walking is very important other exercises would also help but i find the exercise in the outdoors is best for me i stopped drinking alcohol as this effect my moods and anxiety a lot im also trying to learn meditation to do before bed then put on relaxing music to fall to sleep with no voice just relaxing sounds this together with the above has been more successful for me than any mesds  it is just as important to do this daily as you would take your meds  i have bipolar 2 and suffer with anxiety i hope this information is useful please never come off any medication with at consulting you doctor some doctors think only mesds will work but i disagree for me i also have the ability to use my bipolar mind which is my favourite part to achieve amazing things meds block that part ❤️,1
eyes wide shut my ex showed it to me horrible i already hate tom cruise and nicole kidman but that just topped it off,0
please find out if you are bipolar this is very common behavior for someone with bipolar if you have bipolar you can work on a plan to address this behavior you may not have bipolar but if you do you should be addressing it properly instead of treating depression and anxiety exclusively,1
this is a tough situation but not uncommon i was diagnosed with bp ii more than 25 years ago and still struggle with taking meds most if not all of the meds used have side effects and some are worse than the bipolar itself the only thing you can control in this situation is you but you can continue to encourage him to take the meds there are many meds available and everyone responds differently to them he can tell his psych he wants to try something different because he cant tolerate the side effects i have also found that supplements magnesium and vitamin d help me tremendously you may want to suggest something like that as well keep in mind that you cant force someone to do something and threatening typically doesnt help focus on you and taking care of yourself and let the rest work itself out,1
i think your being to hard on yourself stay in treatment and keep trying w the meds focus on you and your recovery stop worrying about everything and everyone else take a deep breath exercise get out of bed for awhile you can always go back to bed but i fins if i shower and get ready for the day i feel much betterjust take some me time your worth it hang in there i know first hand its not easy but u can only change you,0
very well said  i have to deal with depression anxiety and multiply split personality disorder & what u say there is bank on 100%  deep breaths n happy thoughts,1
i didnt even know it was thought to be ok to continue psych meds while pregnant so when i decided to get pregnant i weaned myself off before i even started trying i wasnt going to risk something going wrong with my baby because of my meds,0
some have supportive families i am one that does not i have 4 chikdren and of the four only 2 speak to me and tney are unable to helpme in any way the other two well one is an addict and the older is embarrased of me as her mother i was forced tolive with my oldet sister this past feb and ahe just dont understand what is going on with me and has no interest in learning she is verbally abusive and i feel very enslaved in her home im not allowed to have a bad day and its getting harder to fake being happy in her home my stress level is through the roof thank god for a good therapist and a even better psychiatrist that is steadily getting my meds increased to a threuaputic level my highlight daily is checking the mail awaiting word from social security to hear about my disabilty please pray that i get out of this situation soon!!! and god bless the writer of this post for coming out of your darkness!!!,0
thats shameful of yr hubby to speak to you this way love to you ,0
youre supposed to start on the lowest dose and slowly start to go up to avoid the rain it is a symptom that makes you basically allergic to your own skin your doctor should have informed you of this and told you to send him a picture of the rain immediately when it appeared to determine if it was from the medication you did the right thing to stop it if you stopped it soon enough it should subside,1
personally i think it is irresponsible to not take meds if your doctor gave them to you what happened to grown up self disciple? i take mine if not for me then for the people who have to deal with me it isnt fair to them for me to refuse my meds and then expect them to understand when i have bad day or i am acting up or in depressive slump i love the people in my life and would rather spare them the hardship of living with me unnecessarily because i choose not to swallow a few pills i have ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar 1,1
latuda caused me to get akithesia (severe restlessness to the point i couldnt stand sit or lie down for even a few minutes at a time) and i tried it twice as it had started to help my moods going on 2+ years and still cant find a med to stabilize my bipolar,1
hi i was put on zoloft 300mgs i feel they dont work that much but everyone is different & i do have alot of stress in my life atm which doesnt help,1
i feel like you really need to tell your psychiatrist this because they can change up your medicine to help you especially ask for something for anxiety i dont know how well itd work on you but xanax has helped the best for me i havent had an anxiety attack or mental break down since taking it,1
hehecharlie brown actually calms my anxietyiguess he worries for me,1
ask your psychiatrist hearing voices alone is common with mdd and severe anxiety,0
i have the start also xanax and for me is a big thing because me and medication are not big friends but i have to because my anxiety is high but i go to work but i am in a rollercoaster from my emotion so,1
yeah my husband said he is running out of excuses for why i dont do the family get togethersi told him to tell the truth i am not ashamed i just want to be the old mei would be happy with half of the old me,0
that was really good thats like a lesson to learn all my family never want to deal with me my bipolar 2 we major depression when my mother died i was just 11 and a half so that my living hell nah my two children has the same thing and me and my daughter can live together shes 21 its really hard and painful my son has autism we bipolar right now hes at the hospital he got days he cant control himself but every one thing that i dont have nothing in my community because i dont act aggressive the days i dont feel good i stay home or i go right away to my psychiatric increase or remove medicine then im working for me and they give me new medications ive been like that all my life also i used to have adhd right now is getting to me like today i have surgery my hands and i dont even hear the phone ringing my daughter say how you doing how is the surgery i only got a couple friends not too many anymore and they alway from this country but they got me support and that whats up and a lot of people my community my doctors and i really appreciate that but lately ive been thinking about what im doing this were leaving with this illness i feel guilty like i did something wrong my life and then i start thinking i never been bad in my life im always do the right thing and always help others and im a happy person we others make everyone happy and im the last what am i doing wrong why i have this newness and now my two children thats so sometimes say i want to jump in a river or something so my diet be helpful lately im getting tired about this world,0
i was super panicked all of the sudden this morning but it passed quickly i have been depressed the last week so maybe its a sign of new light coming at least i hope so,0
i do risky behaviors when im manic the goal is to have less manic episodes but u gotta find a medicine that wirks,0
if it were high blood pressure and you changed you diet and exercise and still suffered wouldnt you then talk with your dr about a low dose medicine to help you feel better?,0
i also have bipolar anxiety and panic attacks i think reading the messages triggers you because its a constant talk of the disorders,1
i was on medication for years but it just made me very tired and gain weight ive been off since may i can get really anxious sometimes but i try to go for a walk or listen to music and it will usually pass im hoping exercise will help too,1
i was on the same combo but i couldnt handle the weight gain from abilify i was on effexor and trazodone only for many years until earlier this year at that point i needed more help i had a lot of suicides (friends) and just knew i couldnt take any more loss i began remeron but have noticed the weight gain again im just trying to get better at this point so weight gain is the least of my worries good luck to you and hope you can find something to work and if nothing else peace,1
if i have an infection in my body antibiotics will in fact cure me of that infection resting will help me feel better faster but that isnt what will heal me people do help if it wasnt for my friends and family being there by my side and supporting me i wouldnt be able to make it through life yes i have to do the hard work myself but anything that helps me without hurting me is much needed in surviving a mental illness the things that dont help is just trying to "hold my head up" and "stay strong and move on" if it was that simple nobody would have anxiety or ptsd or depression or any other mental illness im not trying to give you a hard time but telling someone that is swiftly sinking into the pit of darkness that nobody can help them is fucking bullshit! nobody can do the work for me but they can help me from falling too far and thats an important thing to remember sometimes it really does take more than "strategic planning" and hoping for the best,0
you were doing well with your anxiety because of your meds why go off them,1
absolutely horrible spent nearly a month in bed worst medication i ve ever been on - nearly killed me!!!,1
not everyone is comfortable with talking about how they will with others all the time who is telling you that you are not showing the right response i dont think there are any its natural to be worried especially if you are a sensitive person you are also quite young and having a baby is a big responsibility its normal to be excited and looking forward to something yet at the same time be worried about things it probably would help to find someone to talk to but not because someone is saying you are not behaving how they think you should but to reassure yourself,0
for me right now it is like i am having a dream after so many years of my life waking up every day to nightmares there is hope i am living proof i have my life back after being diagnosed with bipolar anxiety and ptsd 20 years ago i try to enjoy my life everyday while i have been stable these past 5 years and not take my life for granted i now work as peer support specialist at kings view for the oakwellness center and use my life journey with mental illness to inspire mentor and empower others and let them know there is hope we are so much stronger than we think,0
are all you guys mostly based in america - its real hard getting medication off the drs here in england he put me on sertraline (200mg daily - off the books) and all it does is stop the hysterical crying i still have anxiety attacks i still go into mad rages still have days where i just want to be a million miles away from everyone still have the crazy dreams and i still have so much going on in life that i have to get through,0
its a catch 22 sometimes youre so fetup you want to end it all then you are obsessed with the thought of dying this can swirl for ever in my head,0
i find it really hard to work with other humans lol tried to get back in to the work place but peoples attitudes and boundaries made my mh worse so i now volunteer from home for an animal rescue far less pressure and the freedom to have bad days without losing wages or feeling bad when needing time out,0
im trying so hard to stay strong and to get through this best as i can but with little to no support i just feel defeated everyone always leaves and nobody understands its harder than what people think im sorry to anyone who feels the same as me heart breaks easily and it hurts to the point my muscles do tense up for days i do sleep too much i binge eat and participate in risky activity im just sad because i feel like if i never would have started taking bi polar meds i wouldnt be bi polar but it was all to get out of an abusive situation now im stuck,0
after reading this ive realised ive being doing all of that over the last couple of weeks now im worried ,0
i use seroquel as a sedative cause i have sleeping issues (insomnia) and i have lexapro (an antidepressant) to counter act the depressive side effect of seroquel and to help me w my anxiety and depression it works fine w me i take 150mgs every night 9:30pm and id be asleep by 11 i used to take only 50mgs and it kinda makes u immune to the sleeping effect so my dosage got higher haha hope this helps also seroquel made me lose a lot of weight idk why,1
sounds very much like depression & anxiety 2gether it can be debilitating see yr gp & try & get on to a psychologist or decent councillorluv to you as a fellow sufferer ,1
my dr says its anxiety but i feel more like is have agoraphobia too its hard to figure out,0
i didnt realise this was to high a dose my psychiatrist didnt say anything to me his even said i can take more if it continues not to work properly i have manic depression anxiety bipolar panick attacks any small incident can have me feeling really sad at times especially if someone is nasty to me as i was mentally abused my whole life,1
every time i came off of seroquel with the permission of my psychiatrist i felt like i had a horrible case of the flu now the first time another psychiatrist that should not be practicing took me off 400mg in two weeks and i went into a mixed episode one of the worst experiences ive gone through i was on medical leave for three months the other two times it was a gradual decrease and i did not experience mania or mixed this is just my experience though,0
i had art therapy sessions in rehab and out patient it only made me stress more i never got how coloring is stress relief,0
messed my blood pressure up bad passed out more than once,1
look up the buddhist term "tonglen"in a nutshell its the recognition that all humans suffer-yes even the horrible ones who cause us pain i have to see the person who caused my ptsd a lot as well hes my childrens father & we share custody (though id rather not) but i sit and look at him and try to breathe in his suffering and breathe out that he finds peace (and maybe remorse toosigh) it helps it really does,1
only a doctor knows what they should be you and you really i used to be on depakote and it did the exact same thing to me very irritable but it also made me very angry when i would take it so i stopped on my own taking it and it seems like yes i still have to deal with depression and anxiety and being bipolar at times but i would rather do with the sad and lonely in my heart and in my mind my soul and everything i do being judged unaccepted id rather just die honestly im so tired of this life because everytime i try to do right it seems that i never cared or its never good enough for anyone not for my family my brothers my sisters my girlfriend her friends anybody i dont care any more myself or maybe i do care too much and i just dont know how to express it so im giving up,0
your rightcause i dontand hope i wont !!!!!that scares me ,1
agreed debbie and tarnya i have off the chart severe anxiety panic disorder severe depression type 2 bipolar borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder my bro and i live with one another and when im just about to drift off i swear to god i hear my brother saying "aye candy candy??" but the thing is hes in his room snoring after my mum passed i would hear her too calling my name now i hear bro im not nuts am i???,0
heather morrissey i dont recommend lithium its terribly dangerous ruins your kidneys and is so terrifying to be on god forbid you are in the sun too long or dont drink enough and it can kill you it does terrible things and i found that lamictal helped just as much so i asked to be taken off lithium,1
i have bpd depression anxiety and an eating disorder and i am not willing to get married nor have children im still 20 but if i cant be stable all alone how can i ever have a stable relationship with a partner or children? i will personally pass however everyone is different and you gotta choose what feels best for you ❤,0
let your family n friends know how you are feeling but also know its okay to feel how you are feeling but also know that you are not guilty or defeated even though you feel that way you can get through this its okay to have friends or family help perhaps you might let them know how you are feeling sometimes it just helps to have someone there things that can relax you can be walks i suggest daytime to take on vitamin d also a nice bubble bath with some upbeat music some find also to like meditation yoga exercise or even cooking as relaxing also take one day at a time you can do this just take it slow you can get through this it just takes time be patient with yourself,0

when the person is miserable and there is no hope of recovery this almost never applies to mental illness although we may think so sometimes,0
sometimes all a person can do is battle with suicide on a minute by minute bases with each passing minute there is hope within that help my be foundits lack of hope that kills its such a disgrace that so many service personnel are used to defend the country they love and sent to do what the political elite have not the stomach for but on their return when they suffer with so much trauma physically and mentally they are now of no further use to such political elite they find themselves discarded like one puts out the trashworthless and throw away  a real democratic society is judged by how it treats is disabled and vulnerable i guess a lot of so called democratic societies should really now start to look at how the genuinely really do treat their citizens in time of need,1

welcome to my day the only difference is my only thoughts during the day (especially at a job i hatebut with no transportation to get another one)i am indecisive on the best way to make the pain end came to the realization the other day that no matter which method i deal withits going to hurt as much or worse than what ive been going through all my life i dont have an answerbut with the way it looks like the shtf with healthcare/safety neteven this may not have an answer for the pain question,0
who can i talk to that i can discuss options with to treat my severe anxiety and severe depression? do i need to be referred by a primary care physician to see any specialist?,1
i went through the exact same thing i still have the clutter but i dont stress about it in a way it reminds me how i was when i was manic and to be more cautious about spending also reading the bible and prayer have been a lot of help along with meds,1
i just started it a week ago im taking it for bad anxiety i really hope it wirks,1
you blame me for my sickness and you create intense stress to keep me sicker,1
currently in hospital if you think that you desperately need the help and cant cope then go to the hospital and seek help,1
the following things i have done to help me over the years 1 i wear a hair band or rubber band on my wrist and snap it when feeling the urge 2 rub an ice cube on my forearm or inner thigh when feeling the urge it helps with the numbing 3 i trimmed down my nails also i see a therapist weekly and im in a bipolar/depression/anxiety therapy group every sat morning i havent had the urges in a few years but i have learned to recognize my triggers and how to de-escalate before it goes beyond my control i had to set limits in my life and cut people and things out of my life (triggers),0
talk to your doctor? i doubt any of us are medically qualified to give proper advice,1
seroquel helped me so much with my anxiety its the only thing that ever helped me get off benzos as well it has most definitely saved my life,1
probably why i cant remember shit cause i was stressed my whole pregnancy ,1
i look at my children and my husband and everyone that cares about me and think about how not having me in their lives would affect their future sometimes finding strength is hard but you have to push those thoughts aside they too shall pass they are temporary go for a walk or look into medical cannabis surround yourself with something you love please tell someone you are feeling this way call a hotline or tell your doctor there will be better days but please please tell someone if you are overwhelmed by these thoughts good luck to you you are worth it ,0
sorry for sounding thick neil sandy but if you cant walk how do you answer the door you know i am a carer for my partner who has bipolar and i suffer with severe depression and on my worst days wont even get out of bed for days or feed us as i do all the cooking my partner cant cook and she is a danger to herself if she tried to cook anything eg: she put a tin of soup in the microwave to heat it i wont speak to anyone and so how would i be able to portray that my partner has no maths skills and cannot budget for anything i pay all the bills do the shopping in fact i do everything tbh when that day arrives which is coming soon i have bought my rope and will leave this life as the stress of all this is slowly killing me anyway to be plunged into debt because my esa and partners dla is stopped i cant do this at all sorry if this has detracted from original post really i am,0

julie barron this i remember my mother persistently saying it was selfish and id fall further down the rabbit hole my brother on the other hand would say "no heres something you can live for why dont we wait until this moment and then see how you feel then" and his approach was far more helpful than guilt was,0
i took it back when my anxiety was way worse it helped but made me really sleepy,1

yes i am 59 and am having a horrible mixed episode which quite seriously scares me- i had a side effect from my go to mood stabilizer and ever since life is quite the roller coaster- finally i pursuaded them to let me try it again and see if my sodium goes to low again i eat salt all day long now,0
your feelings are definately valid good on you for trying again sometimes it takes a few therapists until you find someone you click with it can be difficult and scary to open up but a good therapist will never judge you and they understand its not easy let us know how it goes xxx,0
oh honey its a shame you dont have your parents support speak to a doctor trusting adult relative you are certainly not alone and there is nothing to be ashamed of we are all here helping each other xxx,1
i too am diagnosed with bp2 i am currently taking medication its constantly an on and off cycle for me ive also noticed if i track my nutrients such as b vitamins folate and magnesium specifically in my diet i can maintain a more stable mood its hard because for 10 years ive tried to figure out patterns nowadays i know if i wake up with a bunch of energy and i start organizing or cleaning or trying to do everything at once i know im in a manic moment its an every day struggle but for me tracking my moods and what nutrients i am in taking have really helped i use cronometer for nutrient tracking n i journal for mood patterns information and structured routine is key for me also its very difficult to meditate but i try to because that also puts me in a much better mood afterwards,1

you could also use certain alarm clocks on your phone that wont stop remembering you until you scanned the barcode of the packaging the medication comes with or a photo of the packaging you need to get up grab it and scan/take a picture of it so you cant accidentally snooze it again and again and then forget of you just stopped the alarm or actually took the medicine while doing that,1
i just keep telling myself "i will come back" i have rapid cycling bipolar 2 that for years and years has been untreated as its polar extremes where not so damaging i could fit in and survive without anyone really knowing all those years i got to know myself and my disorder then just over three months ago bam my depressive episode came and stayed it is darker and more destructive than anything i had felt before all of my worst days were not in fact my worst i can at times by not sleeping eating and taking un prescribed med induce a high/mania but hell if i thought my new low pole was badmy new high is just scary so iv reached out and am now properly medicated almost a month on medication now no real change yet but no ones got the phone in hand calling the white bus so i think i must be doing okay my disorder has changed instantly for what appears to be no reason i think my rapid cycling days are over im in for long standing mood shifts that stay like seasons all the time i disliked my disorder i now want it back we are still here underneath all the cloudy turmoil on the surface you will come back we need to conserve the energy for calmer waters and then swim fast when we are able not doing anything doesnt feel right i know and waiting for everyone else to catch up when you have asked for help is just crushing hang in there you will come back i feel that if i give up now going through these real bad times then all the other times i survived become worthless i thought they were the nightmare they were not maybe this isnt either i am a soul inside a body with a mind that doesnt function properly i am here i will come back to the surface just as soon as i can so can you if you can pick up a pen writewrite it all though dont read it back always a trigger keep it safe till your better able to understand it take something from it all later if all it does is get it out and onto paper thats ok if you can share it with your closest friend ask them to quietly write back find little ways to reach out when you can you have survived so much already fellow warrior do not despair! you will be back x,0

wow! youve come a long way you just dont realize it i think that is i think that you dont realize it; i know that you have come a long way obviously i am also bipolar so please let me try to explain it in 500 words or less lol what i see is a sensitive strong caring woman who has despite the odds; found the diagnosis because she refused to quit searching for it i also have a little secret for you there are a lot of very successful and famous because of it people who were just where you are in life careerwise until one day   walt disney einstein bill gates and more google them in fact google everything it will tell you the same thing im about to tell you your mental illness is caused by brain chemical imbalances that is what causes bipolar disorder and depression; and thats physical so maybe your mother can relate to that and maybe she cant but its your problem and i dont think that you can count on much help from anyone around you right now and obviously you know that something has to change before it just keeps getting worse day in and day out i could be wrong about all this but i dont think so because i experienced the same things all of them doesnt it make you mad that we make ourselves hurt physically? and doesnt it make you mad that all we want to do sometimes is sleep? and doesnt it really make you mad that your not one of those people who get motivated when they get mad? at least not long enough to get where you want to be "me too!" i just get mad well i am going to tell you what has made differences in my life and maybe or maybe not you can try them and see if they help you #1 dont ever give up on god or think that god has given up on you you are wonderfully and fearfully made psalm 139 in his image genesis 1 (later im going to tell you about a daily devotional i came accross in sam"s club of all places it has changed my life) #2 i said earlier that this is your problem not because i dont know how you have tried and tried to deal with it but dealing with things or i guess i should say not being able to deal with things is a symptom a symptom of your illness; not a personality trait when people are experiencing symptoms mental or physical that they are unable to get relief from they need assistance with this there are lots of places and people that are willing to help you with the process of recovery from total disfunction you might try to google or search your yellow pages under counseling or something similar ask whoever answers a phone for assistance on where to go if not there who to call if not them your school might even have resources through the academic counseling office #3 when you do find who is right for you; if you still are out of school and work apply for social security disability you are entitled to receive assistance with this to provide you with health insurance and financial support this is always a timely grueling process and you will automatically be denied several times everyone always is get an attorney right away to help you file and appeal there are ones who specialize in assisting us and they dont want any money from you unless and until you win your case dont feel like your above this or that you dont deserve the assistance thats your illness and people who are not experiencing what you are talking i think your family loves you dearly but they truly dont understand not a lot of people do; in fact it wasnt that long ago that they just diagnosed us nuts instead of chemically imbalanced thank god for science #4 you already do this never give up i promise to be praying for you and when you can get this book ill send you some example pages i swear its like it was written for us its like jesus talking right to me about exactly what i need to hear when i need to hear it its called "jesus calling" experiencing peace in his presence by sarah young,0
yes and the weepingand hypochondria john carli and jessica? do you suffer from hypochondria? and always tired its so sad really and i want to be alone and then i get depressed and anxious because i am alonesuch a mess,0
there are things that have happened in my life which im positive are memories but when ive asked others that were supposedly there they say no some of these "false memories" are so vivid that im positive that i experienced them but its amazing what the mind can convince you of it makes you question your memory on anything and everything its horrible,0
i am not a professional and dont know the exacts of your situation but i will speak as someone who similar to your friend pushed everyone away with the intention to die alone he is not thinking straight while sick and desperately needs you and needs help even if he is mad at you now if he can get better hell understand and youll be closer for it he is hurting you to push you away not because he is actualy mad staying in his life is a start though may not be enough if you are able to contact his therapist or doctor please do so and let them know what is going on and ask what you can do to help more try and find a way to ease his isolation as best you can try to get him to engage in activities with you there is also a program in many areas refered to as a baker act i recomend it only as a last ditch effort if he is showing signs of self harm or immediate danger it is drastic and harsh but if it saves his life it is worth it,0
ive taken it for years def helps me i cant manage my anxiety without it ,1
i thought i have outgrown my anxiety but i guess i was wrong,1
i battle depression and anxiety a day bipolar i have my good days and i have my bad days its hard to battle mental disorders,0
unfortunately it is a real issue idk if its caused by a hormones fluctuation due to chemical changes when we hit a manic phase or what exactly but its like you crave sex like youre in heat and get a euphoric physical and emotional high off of it then in depressive phases we usually dont crave sex as much and want a more emotionally nurturing relationship it can lead to issues such as risky sexual behavior putting yourself in potentially dangerous situations you normally wouldnt such as one night stands or not using a condom and even put you in a position to seek emotional sexual validation from someone besides your partner or even actually physically cheat on your partner even if youre not the "cheating type" sometimes emotional sexual validation is enough such as your partner telling you how beautiful/sexy you are and being flirty other times if youre feeling more emotionally distant you may feel the need to get down and dirty multiple times before you can feel satisfied for the time being its also not uncommon to desire more "primal" rough meaningless sex during these phases and feel left wanting if you are normally they type who enjoys more gentle love making without communication it can lead to frustration in the bedroom with good communication you partner can learn to read you signs of manic state and be able to adjust their approach to sex accordingly but first they have to be able to understand why youre feeling this way and what they can do to help what to avoid and so on sorry i may have had one too many conversations w my psychiatrist concerning sex as some of my issues disturbed me until i found out they were pretty normal for ppl w my diagnosis learning that there was not anything "wrong" w me its just how my brain works definitely made it easier to talk to my husband about without feeling ashamed feel free to pm me if youd like to ask any questions in private,0
i feel lazy but it is a war with various sized battles every day my wife supports me and the kids i havent been able to hold a jobever the longest i held a job was 6 months that was as a cashier at chevron but we both hated that and so i quit that one i actually did find a nice job that paid less than minimum wagebut they closed up shop and moved on ive tried various pills and such and ive tried talking to people but ive not found anything that works and im afraid to try anything else since the side effects have been (so far) permanent and not fun and because the people that i talk to that are supposed to help dont care im just a paycheck to the ones ive met so far i dunno what to do but im draining my wife of energy and i dont want to do that she has worked so hard for the last ten years to support me she would be much better off financially without me she assures me she wouldnt be as happy without me but i think she could do much better and be much happier and all i feel like i do anymore is whine about my issues,0

its not as easy as a lot of people think even ex-cutters some people dont have as much as a daily struggle as certain other people i know for myself and quite a few others i have met it is almost an addiction like alcholism or drugs for various other reasons but it can cause similar symptoms when it comes to withdrawal etc what you need to realize is this may make it harder for the next few weeks to hell even months of getting back on the horse of no longer doing it but dont stop trying just breathe pick yourself up and start running after that damned train that left you behind theres no reason you cant be amazing and great at the moment just shoot for something a bit simple shoot for not cutting for a week every week you dont cut allow yourself a treat you dont often get whether its chocolate special coffee something really simple and cheap once you hit that month mark buy yourself a dinner out tell someone whether its someone who personally knows you or not tell someone who knows how hard it is so they can correctly celebrate with you once you hit that six months i do something like alcoholics do i buy myself a token of some sort to mark the day then i buy a different one for a year and so on i usually do something really geeky because i am a geek and do something with pokemon and evolutions just remember every time you feel the desire there are other ways to get the release may if it will help write down your other coping strategies where you keep your cutting tool? if you want feel free to message me on facebook i will happily be that person to celebrate a no-cutting week with you ^^,0
i got my pet therapy note from my phsyciatrist and gave it to my landloard as my apt company doesnt allow pets but i live in maine so the rules might different where you live :) i dont know what i would do without my lexi!! she definately helps with my anxiety bipolar and ptsd,1

unimaginable and invisiblei dont know if this can be counted as a mental illness or maybe the symptoms of depression and anxiety that i have but i bought a new phone very expensive a 2 month worth of my salaryi loved the cyan one i bought is it board and hard fried after 5 hours of use then i returned ans they told me there is no cyan color on the market anymore you have to buy the black one! all the excitement that i had for the cyan one when i was looking at it and the faint happiness that it gave me is now turned to anger hate and disgust and even a mental pain when i am looking and holding the black one in my handi cry and cry when i have to use my phone it may seem ridiculous to everyone but the pain i feel is very real sadly and there is nothing i can do i want to accept and move on but this pain has already chained and nailed me down to the ground really hardwhy it has to be this way? i always have wondered,0
self harm is something we learn to do to cope with a "pain" or trauma that we either cant face or wont face ( sometimes we dont even know what it is weve blocked it) it can actually release endorphins ( the bodys own natural pain killer like morphine ) so even tho we feel a little pain from the cut we might actually feel good from the endorphins! so in a strange way we use it as a poor form of therapy it helps us avoid a larger "pain" and it makes us feel better the trick is to develop better coping techniques to help us feel better and to find someone safe that we can divulge ( or discover) what the real problems are and then get better!,0
what a great service i hate making phone calls in fact it sends me into a panic so texting is great for me shame this isnt in australia,0
you mite try lexapro for depression alprazolam for anxiety and seroquel at a low dose for the bipolari have panic attacks all my life ( its inherited ) but there is nothing better than having a liltalk with jesus if ur a christian or whom ever ur higher power is i choose god,1
after reading this ian like this but my doc say i only have anxiety and depression i have highs and think nothing of doing anything and feel fab then the low when i dont want to speak to anyone and shut myself away i get in trouble at work and beacuse i do i think people are talking about me,0
i agree none of their bussiness till after a few dates and you feel you can trust them not to take advantage of you till then if you feel the funk coming on and they want to see you just avoid it i have experianced when someone knows right off the bat it has not turned out well been taken advantage of played games with my head like i had to question my actions run for the hills and the guys i waited to tell have said i never notice the nice ones i would say really i am bat shit crazy the whole time i would be with them i would fight the head chatters and seroquel i could not take or i would take a nap but now i just figure its to much a pain i attract toxic people so if some nice man comes my way great if not o well,0
i spent years lashing out at the people i love desperately looking for someone or something to blame for my bipolar disorder and desperately projecting my fear anger and confusion onto others in vain efforts to dissipate or lessen the pain i felt in time i learned that peoples patience however much they love you has to be finite for their sake and their emotional wellbeing mental illness always has collateral damage and its those closest to us who suffer when we do now i have a baby daughter i have made a choice that i will always work to protect her from any potential ills my condition brings that primarily involves being active in my wellbeing taking responsibility for my behaviour and owning my mind again its far from easy it often takes greater effort than i am able to give but for her sake and for those i love i keep going good luck to you both x,0
you are afraid because you grew up afraid when parents put fear in their children they are scared to do anythingeven breathe you also may be scared of hurting them but if they are hurting you you need to go its the first step in a new beginning do whats best for you you have to take care of yourself because nobody else will,1
i have bipolar and am going through exactly to a tee everything you have just said its amazed me actually i felt like i wrote that i had to take a double take that it wasnt my profile !!! your def bipolar and its not uncommon to have adhd or ocd and especially anxiety with bipolar  im on lithium  epival  lorazepam combo right now you need some sort of medication for sure for it just have to find the right one pm me if you want to chat we have so much in common regarding mental health it would be good to talk to someone like you ,1
i had 3 horrible dreams last night which woke me up so abruptly i just want to feel the most like"myself" as i can,0
idk but try searching about paranoid personality disorder and maybe when you know more about it you can comfortably discuss it to your doctor or therapist,1
i have a nephew like this he has thrown stuff hit us his grandmother included wrapped his hands around our throats till finally we had to literally choose did we want to live in fear of what he could or would do to us and/or others after battling years and him physically attacking a police officer the courts understood our plea and put him in a mental institution its never the ideal situation,0
im a sufferer of depression and anxietyi always have to say to myself i am not alonebuild your wall around you dont let anyone or anything breakthrough it lots of ❤ xx,0
april please resist the urge it may feel like a release at the time but in the long run it doesnt heal the pain and the scars never heal please dont do it i will worry about you all night now,0
i think hospitalization might help the most right now if youre able to do it the length of time probably would be determined by the doctors/medical staff because of what youre experiencing right now and i know that might be scary; it would be for me i really encourage you to go immediately i dont want you to hurt yourself anymore; its not fair for you to be hurting this much im really proud of you for reaching out like this youre better than this pain; you deserve so much more ill be thinking about you and sending good/warm thoughts your way go now sweetheart im keeping you in my ,0
thank you sometimes its my way of closure but sometimes it can be my down fall my major problem is that it keeps on working all the time so many thoughts and no breaks within my mind im always thinking my mind is never silent and its always about things that most in the world dont think about nor worry about thus making me feel like i am slowly going insane i feel like i am stuck in a world of people that are unaware of the hidden dangers amongst the many i so rarely find people that think the same as me and view things truly open minded i am self aware of my own faults as well as others its a blessing and a curse all together,0
oh your not alone at all  im sorry your suffering but you pretty much took this out of my brain  and theres a a few things u mentioned i will also look into  thank you for sharing <3 helps me feel not so alone  yeah find a new therapist doctor whatever  i do suggest trying marijuana and finding the right strain for you and theres also dif products that dont get u stoned if u needed to work  i really hope you find something and some one to help  iknow how scary and fucking frustrating it is take care if you cant take it one day at a time try to takw it hour by hour xo,1
it helps me with anxiety,1
omg thats definitely me all day every day  its a daily struggle,0
in australia prescription medication isnt allowed to be advertised only the over the counter stuff it would annoy me using actors although a person with anxiety and/or depression might be too anxious or depressed to actually do an ad what would be good is if they consulted with people that are affected by the illness and maybe had people say what its really like so am actor had a small understanding of what its like,0
i think fear of the unknownmyths and stigma has a lot to answer for,0
to me i would get your medication adjusted ive been through the same with depression and anxiety i really hope you make it through!!,1
wanna explain why this is disturbing ??,0
come on i myself have had this darn bi polar depression anxiety n stress all my 51 years on this planet and if an ol bugger like me can still do my best to kick the demon down and keep it at bay im sure you can be strong and do pretty much the same paige*,1
each person responds differently to meds so keep that in mind ive been on it for nearing 2 years when first taking it i felt miserable from the side effects but it didnt last long,1
hydroxyzineit is not a strong drug but works for anxiety serequil is hard core and hard to get off hydroxyzine is also used for itching basically its a benadryl on steroids,1
i am bit scared the take medication for it,1
hello i have been where you are i am 38 and wasnt diagnosed until i was 33 with bi-polar 1 anxiety and borderline i can tell you it caused a lot of issue for me relationship wise and i wish i would of had someone back then to help me before i was placed on my meds i was pretty unstable  anger  moods all over the place and very impulsive it even lead me into some legal issues the downward spiral you are having right now is due to not being able to process the emotions at the moment correctly and that is because you are inconsistent with your meds your bf threat to leave is a understandable reason for this spiral but speaking from having been thru a similar thing before its because he wants to see you mentally healthy if you two have been together over 5 years i am sure he has seen you at your best and your worse my suggestion to you is to look into if you have a stabilization center near you i have had to do it a couple times in the past you can check yourself in as a walk in  average stay is 3-5 days if you truly want to help yourself then becoming stable should be your priority and once you do this you will see the talk from him of leaving was just his way of trying to get you to realize you need the help,1
i used to be on lamictal but was taken off because of bad side effects but dont remember what and ive been on for quite some time propranolol which is actually a high blood pressure med i believe but not for anxiety or bipolar im on lithium for the bipolar which has given me permanent hand tremors and the propranolol is to combat them and im just so so lucky (sarcasm) that the lithium doesnt help the bipolar and the propranolol doesnt help the tremors sorry im of no help,1
bp1/panic disorder/ ptsd i got ssi my first try at the age of 28 i think my case maybe a little different because i was diagnosed at 17 with hospitals stays in between the time i got on ssi medical paperwork is very important for your case,1
the medication abilify 5 or 10mg changed my life it helps with paranoia i know i am a very paranoid bi polar patient after taking if for a month i was able to work through the emotions that i internalize and bottled but but what doesnt help is a partner who is not supportive,1
right now i am more depressed than i think i have ever beenmy mood swings are ridiculous i either have insomnia or sleep for hours on end i have a lot of other health issues and other things that i am dealing with right now that have me stressed out,1
i developed a lot of anxiety over the years which is harder to live with than the rest,1
i have been shaking all day and not feeling my normal self dont know why no med changes but having trouble sleeping like i do when there is a new change this shaking is awful nothing seems to help this is definitely not in my normal realm of ups and downs,1
the struggle is so real,0
i took it for a while 300mg i would take it and within 15 mins i was knocked out asleep i would take it at sleepovers and my friends would make fun of me bc id start babbling incorrectly and pass out id sleep with no minimum of 9 hours and getting off of it was a bitch withdrawal and irritability were making my life hell then but as a medication for mood stability it worked very well probably one of the best ive taken faitige is the main down fall,1
oh wow i know all about these feelings as described above each and every one of them they used to hound me every minute of every day until i lived in this awful vacuum that was slowly sucking me in and sucking my life out suicide seemed the only way to escape the pain the frustration the black clouds surrounding me the black pit that was my life threatened to drown me in its slime my daughter had by now completely rejected me but i can understand why there was so much hurt from emotional abuse ld suffered from the men in my life (l was unable to be all l should have been in my marriages because of the awful love/hate l felt for my verbally abusive dad) diagnosed bp ii in 2008 after a severe head injury and full left hemiplegia motorcycle accident 75 l struggled to keep going but the anger and rage poured out on my elderly late husband every night ( dangerously stressful job with severe discrimination harassment and sexual harassment for ten years ) i was severely suicidal and told my very wise and wonderful sister of all my problems i was shocked stunned ive never seen her like that she told me that shed wanted to tell me for a long time she said "stop feeling sorry for yourself!! youre healthy physically you have eyes ears and all four limbs stop being a martyr stop all the me me me me me and get a life!!! think about all you have start being grateful she loves joyce meyer and loves her popular phrase "stinkinthinkin get rid of it!! find something youre passionate about and do it whatever it is help others less fortunate than yourself climb out of yourself start being kind to yourself start loving yourself spoil yourself stay on your meds change your life only you can well thanks very much missy lm older than you how dare you speak to me like that??? but you want to know something? today l live a wonderful positive peaceful and happy life whenever negative thoughts try to creep in l say out loud move back on out l wont allow you to destroy me again speak to god he is right there to help you and he will we screwed up in paradise and that is why we have illnesses to try us but through the lord we can and will overcome may god bless you in your new mindset love felicity,0
lamictal made me nervous and jittery unable to focus or sit still,0
hopeless sounds like low energy and at minimum mild depression by now you may have self confidence and self esteem issues as well and thus some social anxiety are you in counseling? are you in a bp support group? do you get a little exercise? have you considered a pet? have you evaluated your meds with your doctor because its not normal for you to be suffering,1
oh yes it is fair i think she should walk the path of shame this time because sh denied her family once again for this kind of life and meher mom was the only one there for her 100% 24hr and he was off living in the streets not worrying about finding a place for her to go to or supporting her to stay clean just bringing her back down after a year of soberity,0
one of my favorite psychologists was in a rural setting the rural life can do wonders for mental health be proactive and seek support but dont be afraid of this change! it can truly be wonderful,0
and me maybe we start to think thst we arr letting people make us feel guilty or that we make ouselvrs feel guilty?? eeasier said than done though!!!,0
you need to see a dr to get referred to a psychiatrist and therapist you cant deal with this all on your own look up mindfulness it is great for dealing with anxiety although you will probably have trouble doing it yourself to start with but it might be worth checking if out while you wait to see your specialist,1
we might not know each other but please dont hesitate to send me a message if you need more advice or just an outlet to talk to ❤️ ,1
that drug was my worst nightmare made me drool and not know it made my eyesight go i couldnt see and no-one would believe me of my symptoms it was the most horrible time in my life except for being in a straight jacket in a padded cell,0
totally understand everyday is a battle i have the same here a party to go to people i dearly want to see invites to dinner all lovely things with lovely people but its a battle just thinking about going let alone actually going do try if you can i try and when people dont understand me i simply say thank goodness i hope they never have to at the moment i have had my medication changed and its sent my head into a turmoil worrying and overthinking them its all these things that are catastrophized by us but are small things to others good luck i hope you can muster up the energy xx,0
40 years bipolar polypharmacy and 15 years ect 20 hospital admissions  25 years as gp doctor primarily practicing psychological medicine 20 years personal psychotherapy the best advice for you diet wt loss exercise resistance bands at home and join gym 90 circuits in 90/days cheap make exercise something you do everyday and reduce alcohol consumption preferably cease alcohol pathway to lower anxiety symptom load low anxiety essential to sense of well being,1

i have ptsd chronic depression anxiety and bipolar your symptoms qualifie you for social security disability im on it took me a year to get you need a disability lawyer otherwise you will never get it,1
i didnt realize until i was installing fb on my mothers smart phone plastered across the top of her feed read "bond michele bond commented in the group bipolar/depression/anxiety" people can see what we write if they go looking but is it necessary to advertise?,1
yes! thank you! bipolar/depression/anxiety open page please try to post these larger versions of these pics moving forward!,1
it was terrible for me caused me to be very irritable at the time i was on it a few years ago i had been misdiagnosed with bipolar i quickly took myself off of it years later this year turns out i actually have bpd/ major depression/ anxiety im on paxil and xanax now and its helped wonders just keep in mind different medicines react differently with each individual,1
my husband has bad anxiety and is seriously insecure and he also has depression but hes still an amazing husband and father hes kind and funny and sweet and loving and compassionate he never lets me go a day without making sure i know he loves me,0
you sound an aweful lot like me i was diagnosed with bipolar 16 some years ago and went through a really bad depression/high anxiety bout about a year and a half ago ive been treated like a guinea pig over the years with one med after the other which has made me very hesitant to change i also deal with low sex drive and my husband was (and still is) my biggest supporter but i finally found the right combination of medication therapy and ive become a facilitator for dbsa where i can help others who are still struggling i know changing meds can be scary but you owe it to yourself to be 100% the person you can be,1
its taken me 16 years to find the right doctor and right combination im on prestiq and rexulti both of which i couldnt afford without the medication program through the pharmacy at the mental health clinic i go to i have severe anxiety and depression and since being on this combo i finally feel normal after many years of struggling you will get there just dont give up,1
i feel you i finished cosmetology school last year and ive had one job then was fired after a month since then ive been spiraling almost to the point of wanting to see a psychiatrist again ive been med free 8 years and too scared to go back i wanna get an evaluation done and go through my medical records and see if my diagnosis is still the same of if theres anything new im finding it hard to call places back that i apply to and i find it hard to even get my career going i cant live at home with my parents supporting me forever im a damn trainwreck and somehow i manage i still wanna live even if its exhausting,0
because i dont know who i am anymore ive been rejected made fun of put down and hurt so many times and the ones who claim they care are the first ones who are the first ones to leave or give up no im not happy with my life yes im trying to change that but the thing i want so desperately bad keeps getting held in front of me and just when i think it is finally going to happen it is yanked away again and again like its some kind of joke,0
hi ive been where you are right now when people dont understand they are afraid of all the stupid stigmas about us there are support groups they are really helpful and some communities have casual drop in places and you will see that others there are great people,0
i started on 50mg and then 75mg after 3 weeks anxiety is definately much better ive been on sertraline for along time and lithium and both suit me well,1
its so hard not to feel guilty on trying to help other people it feels like madness ,0
admitted to myself that i had a problem in my 3rd trimester of my second pregnancy and my doctor prescribed zoloft i had much better days no problems withdrawls or defects with my little one breastfeeding was not a problem either i wasnt diagnosed as bipolar 2 until a few months ago so idk how other meds may affect pregnancy your doctor will weigh the risks and benifits hope this helps ❤,1
i also feel this sometimes though like of course im grateful to have these medications but i occasionally get angry and bitter that i cant function without them it seems unfair to have to try so much harder than most just to feel like a person its not that i dislike taking the medicine but rather i am bitter that i even have this problem in the first place and if something ever happens to my medicine i would be a total wreck within a few hours it makes me feel weak and vulnerable idk if maybe this is along the lines of what you were feeling?,0
take care of you dont let anyone guilt you into doing anything that will make you more sick when you are stronger and healthier talk to your family with the helpful of a therapist to educate them you are beautiful you are amazing dont let anyone tell you different,0
you have every right to be upset i assume your sister was just visiting from out of town as much as i would i dont recommend flipping out on her but do leg it be know how you feel i also have a question why dont you have medical power of attorney over your father so if this happens again the hospital has to contact you,0
i have info on natural healing both spiritualy and holistic to reverse the symptoms and ilness itself and get u off medications and living a happy and successful life! ptsd bipolar anxiety depression and all other diseases!!!,1
let her know that there are several people in this world who care for their loved ones  she/ he just needs to open up about herself to them and i m pretty much sure that they will be patient listenre and they will listen to watever that person has to say and i say so because a month ago i had met someone with same thing i wont say it as a disorder because it seems like a disease but i feel it is not so everyone has flaws and no one is perfect and their is someoe to accept u in that way  i m someone who is filled with completely trust issues and i dont trust even myself but i m trying to change just because of that one person who came in my life as achange i wanted to be around with her everytime but i lost her cause she found someone else  and the only reason i lost her was because someone else was a better listener and compassionate towards her if u r having this anxiety depression then let me tell u accept it as a fact and wear it like an armour so that no one in this world could hurt u again and agin by saying that u have a disease its a rare thing to have  i have only came across one person and she is almost as close to me as like my mother  but i believe she is unique as she makes people feel special and so i believe u r asweel  people are there to care for u and talk to  its 2 o clock in the night and i m still awake i havent slept in last 4 days  and it always happens to me that i suffer from insomnia after every fortnight  i have lost my lullaby so if u have someone who loves u and cares for u then just dont loose them and talk to them cause u cant bear the pain of loosing the only lullaby,0
hi julie i have bipolar ll and anxiety i am currently on 450mgs effexor in the morning and 10mgs olanzapine (zyprexor) at night after years of different medications olanzapine has been the best one for my anxiety good luck,1
i feel the same way i have a big paranoia that past relationships were better than having me and easier and happier than being with me i feel too crazy i feel mean at times when i snap but cant change it and i always think theres someone else it sucks and the hard thing is trying to figure out if its our head thinking up crap again or if it really is how youre thinking it is however in saying all that im a strong believer that theres someone for everyone to love,0
i have heard horrible experiences,0
3 always panic attacks so strong i almost fainttightness of the chest a mix of ptsd large groups or new situations with large groups is overwhelming,0
im sure many of us as children looked at other parents and thought they were far cooler than our own i guess its human nature to think the grass is always greener unfortunately mental illness isnt nice for any loved ones to deal with especially for a child to understand children unfortunately can be very selfish its not until a lot later that they learn to become selfless some unfortunately never learn but im sure thats not the case for you and your daughter im sure that however hard it is for her now she will learn to accept understand and as she matures im sure she will become a far more tolerant and caring person because of it as others have suggested im sure what she really means is that she wished you were better that you didnt have to suffer and that she didnt have to see you suffer im sure she loves you very much but it must be so hard for her to understand and comprehend why you cant get better we as sufferers dont often understand it because it usually doesnt make sense so how can a child? children can at times be insensitive and hurtful but it can simply be because they dont have the maturity or insight to know otherwise im sure you have come across many adults who can be far more intolerant and insensitive my husband didnt get it but then again i dont think he wanted to your daughter is a young girl she has an excuse bless her im sure its not easy for you im sure probably another day she will completely forget that flippant remark and tell you how much she loves you you are doing all the right things to get better try not to dwell on this xx,0
i have the same problems im thinking its worse when anxiety is high and meds im taking seraquel it seems to be making me sick with nausea and light headed and dizzyness gonna have the doctor take me off on the next appointment scared to just stop on my own and scared its somthing else wrong,1
maybe i should see if i can go back on it used it before for bladder shyness,1
great idea i vote for medals instead to be placed around the neck of the recipient by the stigma doubter that hassled them,0
it is a horrible horrible disease for the afflicted and their loved ones i sit here one of the collateral damaged but i know for my mom the afflicted with manic depression it was a greater hell she was in than mine,0
i was never a fan of linkin park but i am disgusted by all of the negative posts ive been seeing concerning his suicide its indicative of how little people understand about depression anxiety and suicidal thoughts,0
if i was healthy and didnt have ties here i would move in a heartbeat i dont share the same ideals as our "president" nor do i believe stripping the health insurance from 23 million of americas most vulnerable citizens to give americas most wealthy a giant tax break is in the least bit humane or acceptable it would be more humane to line the sick and elderly up against the wall and shoot them,0
no big emphatic no there is no way when i plunge to low that i could possibly follow this advice not a true representation of how depression/anxiety/bipolar works at all!!!!!!,1
i have some of the same issues when i get to anxious i get really sick the stress eats my inside i have gerd now which is acid reflex due to my anxiety i also experience constipation a lot i know its very hard and people dont understand why or how we go through what we have but you are not alone you should seek out a gastrointestinal doctor to prescribe you anti acids they have helped for me a loti also take once in awhile amitza which helps constipation i hope that helps good luck!,1
i have been panicking as shit and struggling to get up from bed but its because i now drive in a big city go to two colleges and for an 18 year old i never expected having so much independence would be so difficult so i guess it freaked me out but usually the first day of school doesnt freak me out and its my second year of college im sure it does have some effect cuz i have never felt so panicky about where my life was going i mean before ive been suicidal and i always thought it was going to be over soon but i felt ok with that and my thoughts and actions made me cry but it isnt the same as that panic ive been feeling,0
hi i take lamactil (as lamotrigine) 200 mg a day - in one dose instead of 100 night and morning as a mood stabiliser and 225 mg or 300 mg of efexor for depression and/or anxiety top up when not stable with 5 mg of olanzapine (as zyprexa) at night works in together well only downside is (in aust anyway) they lamictal isnt on the pbs (pharmaceutical benefits scheme) and the olanzapine leads usually to lots of weight gain,1
well think of bipolar as a rollar coaster you have high and low peaks where your mood can either rapidly alternate up and down or have the longwr lasting shifts ups that last for days ect depression and anger are two of the most common now as for borderline personality  its more like a tilt a wirl your moods can go secerap directions and rapidly  impulsivness is a major part of it as well not making sound judgement and just doing not to mention reations to situations that are commonly deemed inappropriate i myself suffer from both and it took me along time to become stable and somedays i still struggle with it,0
what utter bollocks when anxiety strikes u just dont think of any of these things and this is the problem anxiety isnt funny its a real serious issue these are like telling someone who needs crutches oh if you do x y or z you wont need them so stop telling people how to control anxiety im totally pissed off with this and now removing this post and your page,0
well thats a shame because the forbidden topic is the only thing that has effectively treated either my depression or my hypomania too bad we cant gain support for the overturn of unjust laws that keep medicine from people who need it,0
in the last "42" years i have had two therapist that i felt close to connected with and trusted they save me more than once from self harm or worse it helped to be able to talk to them i no longer have them and i can definitely relate to being disconnected and feeling isolated it is a horrible feeling that no one would ever understand unless they have experienced it i now realize after all of these years that i will just have to except that i am alone in this respect and continue to be thankful for the blessings i do have,0
didnt know this was visible to all my facebook friends really testing this "no shame" thing lol thanks dad love you,0
all else being equal with your mental health issues something happens to a large majority of people when they approach or hit 40 its almost like a mid-life awakening of sorts where you start to really dive in and process some of the shit that has lead you up to this point i am bipolar ll also borderline personality disorder has come up more than once with my current psych also it is what it is flow with it and continue on with the process try not to overthink it and dont stop until you find something that works for you i take lithium which i was told was the gold standard first line treatment for bp2 and it works very well for me take a deep breath and talk to your wife when you arent in the midst of a crisis and ask her to take the lead for you and dont beat her (figuratively) up if you can at all avoid it we all need someone in our corner stay the course for you and the kids you are not alone,1
ive often thought that having a mental illness separates someone from the rest of the world i feel its as though you live almost alongside people but almost in a bubble or a parallel existence never really gelling or fitting in im trying to find the words to describe how it actually feels as im wondering if that is kinda how you might feel its almost as though the rest of society is bubbling along and the sufferer is almost on the outside looking in trying desperately to belong and be accepted but never achieving this its exhausting and sad at the same time as we feel cut off and lonely as well as different and misunderstood finding people who really understand are few and far between i think only those who are suffering or who have suffered in the past truly understand although of course those others who are really struggling have to put their energies into their own survival unfortunately society as a whole doesnt get it it is a crying shame that the world has little patience or acceptance of mental health problems or disability these two massive groups of people as still not treated as equals with very little compassion by the masses and governments alike however much society tries to show it understands and is trying to support us consideration and understanding comes far too short of the mark people havent got time everyone has their own problems time management issues and lives in essence it is each man for himself so those who may need extra help are left almost forgotten and left to cope essentially on their own many people just dont understand mental illness at all im not saying that they all dont try because some do but in a way you cant blame them mental health problems dont make logical sense to the sufferer quite often let alone those who cant understand how it works my husband once said to my son; if you want to go to the party why cant you go? ie my son desperately wanted to go but his acute anxiety stopped him so sad for him but equally sad for his father who didnt comprehend why sometimes the only true support can be found from like minded people have you found any support groups you could visit? other sufferers usually understand and dont judge in society we are judged there are still stigmas and we can be regarded as different and therefore difficult but infact it is usually the opposite we are far more thoughtful more in touch with how we tick more insightful caring and understanding it is hard though to find the right people quite often sufferers only end up with a very close circle of family and friends ive lost many over the years partly because people probably find me hard work and partly because i push them away and dont make the effort never instigating social engagements but often the people who stick by you through thick and thin are the ones that really matter do you have any support in other ways such as medication or counselling cbt etc? with regards to the feeling of not wanting to be here that totally makes sense often its the feeling of not fitting in being so lonely and just existing rather than living to escape this unbearable and exhausting drudge day after day which is so awful to escape this in the right sense is to get better i think we all crave contentment and peace but the long road to recovery can seem so far away and it can feel such a mountain to climb but it is possible a better life is realistic but it does take a lot of resilience determination and time small but significant steps are necessary but can only done by putting lots of things in place such as a healthy diet sunshine a little exercise support from a range of people and professionals possible medication meaningful activities but to start with just little and often etc etc its almost like a plan but its not easy but the results are both life changing and necessary take one small step at a time make achievable goals which you can then congratulate yourself on be kind to yourself reach out to those who care it is a sign of strength if you can do that we all deserve to find that inner peace best wishes x,0
im on 200mg of lamictal its the only thing that seems to give me at least a little relief ive not had good luck with antipsychotics in the past so im reluctant to try latuda i google everything about medications before i take them the trick is to stick to and understand the science side of things and give very little weight to the anecdotal side of things it has also been my experience that the vast majority of general practitioners are not up on the latest research and very few like to listen to the patients knowledge and/or research for example my doc had no clue at all that the only 2 mood stabilizers that are truly effective for bipolar depression are lamictal and lithium the rest of them are more effective for mania/hypomania but at least im lucky enough that she realizes i have 30+ years dealing with bipolar and i know more about it than she does,0
christopher l snead they are scary it took my 5 years to find the right now meds ow i have no bad side effects it was worth the trial amd error,1
the thing scared me to death!!,0
i was on a list of medications that would scare people at one point in time i am proud to say that i have been off all psych and epilepsy meds for over four years! there are days i feel like its too much to handle but overall i am dealing better off the meds than i ever could have on them!! it is doable!! and it is worth it!!!,0
jennifer my son was on abilify and insisted it was not helping after a discussion with his psychiatrist he was taken off abilify all together and put on depekote he was also put on lexapro(sp?) for his depression and xanax for the anxiety talk to your dr its seems to be all trial and error my son was diagnosed in february and has had several med changes already this combination seems to be workingfingers crossed good luck to you sweetiegod bless,1
ive tried numerous prescription medications and was more miserable on them than off! i do occasional use cannabis to relax me,1
after 25 plus years of trying this or that cymbalta works for me and the best thing about it is that it takes about 3 days to start working i am so thankful to have found this medicine its unbelievable for me i am now using cbd oil hempworx it is working wonders on my aches pains and anxiety but my depression not so much yeti have faith <3 if anyone wants info on cbd oil shoot me a message thanks~vonda,1
yes thats very true i start therapy again june 1st so hopefully that will help im pretty calm when im not triggered im not a very violent or angry person but i just randomly snap when under pressure and i want to learn how to control myself better i appreciate the support and advice :),0
i was diagnosed bipolar one 10 years ago after having a psychotic episode out of the blue i always had depression/anxiety and had many labels now ive been on 600mg of lithium for 10 years and after so many meds im on 150 lamotragine 150 quitiapine 15mg diazepam and a sleeping tablet im no longer allowed to take anti depressants as it only took 9 years to find out they made me high leading to 8 hospital stays now i stay out of hospital but am very low and feel im not on the right meds but scared to change as ive put on too much weight already now i know its sweets etc dont help but i was never as heavy than when i was put on meds every night i feel im taking poison and right now i have lots of stress and feel like crying a lot going to see gp soon to talk about my mental health im not ashamed to admit to bipolar etc but the term mental freaks me out im convinced i will never recover from this awful illness xx,0

i could write a long story too but im noti just want to say i hate peopleesp familywho think that because youre diagnosed and are taking meds and seeing a psyche and have seen psychologists that you are fucking ok and not going to drop into depression or skyrocket into a psychotic manic episode(i average 4 of these a year even though im on high doses of meds)i try and hide all my symptoms just to make everyone feel better and not worry about me while silently i die inside slowly with them having no ideaim diagnosed bp1 adhd agoraphobia and social anxietyive found someone special who understands me finally after my marriage of 13years disintegratedat last ive found a reason to look forward,0
im 38 and i struggle with this also,0
hello my dear friend realistically you can’t expect to make it through school without having to deal with some kind of stress granted too much stress can be oppressive wise king solomon wrote: “mere oppression may make a wise one act crazy” (ecclesiastes 7:7) but you need not let stress drive you crazy the key is learning how to manage stress effectively and if youre suffering from depression theres help out there please dont give up you have a good whole life ahead of you ❤️ hope youll find beneficial as it did others this timely article im sharing with you ❤️ ,0
i took it but only for the shakes i got from my anxiety it didnt do anything other than stop my tremors,1

yes!im the same but then after woods i feel bad asking and talking and listening etcetc but then i feel very bad and worry about seen the people again!:(,0
yes i do that when my stress and anxiety is really high almost like a feeling of vertigo and then it passes,0
no crap like this isnt needed not everyone needs to get ofd it and those that do some end up back on it take what worka dont avoid a medication that may work because someone else had trouble i was on 380mg a day and come off it just fine twice!!,1
i have bipolar depression anxiety and ptsd,1
yes maybe im manic a little more than others who are bipolar 2 but this has been a long generated problem since before my diagnosis depression and anxiety came long before bipolar 2 i dont really prefer what type of sex it is but there has to be intercourse or its just more depressing and angering 99% of the time if i want someone ill pursue them and im eerily persuasive my sex habits have been nearly deadly but thank god to this day nothing has ever happened or came up positive,0
bipolar= reactions then thoughts most people think things through then react makes the end result a more logical act instead of an oh shit now what! vert poor at choice making have taken anti psych meds anti depression crap everything from zoloft to lithium to capacitance geoden zyprexa you name it depacote zyprexa ( fat pills) i gained so much weight and experienced a whole new level of depression that led to agoraphobia seemed i was just getting worsebipolar is not easy to write a script for there is nothing made for it so they use dris ade for other ailmentsits all hit and miss now i am on latuda ( mood stabilizer) topiramate ( controls seizures which i dont have )propranolol ( high blood pressure meds i dont have high blood pressure but i shake from the other drugs so it helps with that) prazosin (also high blood pressure med but it als controls the nightmares) this cocktail took me 5 years of trial and error but seems to do the trick have patience we are all unique and for each one of us our cocktail will be unique too keep the faith and embrace your ability and outlook on life so different from the norm never a dull moment,1
karla kremer breister me to a t bleh stupid anxiety,1
dont worry you are not the only one going through this all my family does is being me down and husband is worse on friday after sleeping for a week i tryed to see how i can hang myself but i said to myself i am better than this i have to be strong and bring myself up and if you need a friend you have one here anytime ,0
breath dont worry let it all go the safety of the child and your health is first when you fell it getting over welming breath through it just stop and breath a mountain is a mole hill through gods eyes,0
i think its a worry that if you start on it now you may never be off of it most mean well but you also need to remember different age groups and countries hold different values and are expressed as such i will say finding work that you enjoy in a business you are comfortable in as well as a company that is understanding helps alot with the anxiety at work if you know people will understand and be caring and considerate does help i also know thats very hard to find,1
i hear some ofu say be nice to yr self but when the beast enters the room i just get so mad because i see everything through a different lensso much anxiety i feel like my chest wants to blow up,0
no but effexor made me gain a ton of weight and going off it sucks horribly,0
valium is dangerous if not monitored i would go to a new doctor and get new medication you cant live like that and dont be scared to tell him everything i did that before i was so afraid that the doctors would take my kids away but i got over that delusional thought it bothered me terribly but today i discuss every! every! think,1
well then im fucked ive lived in a constant state of stress for over half my life,0
i suffer with depression and severe anxiety i have 3 children i get up for them and care for them are some days harder than others absolutely but i live for them my partner understands and we talk about it i tell him when im down and most of all i share when im scared he is my rock and when i need a moment he steps right up your not incapable he is he wants to add to your insecurities by telling you that your not "solid" solidity between couples is built each one puts their work in you got this girl and the right "solid man" is out there for you,0
because it will not always be agony if you stay strong you will have a day so beautiful it will be worth it i stay strong for those days even though every day is a struggle,0
sweetie get on different medication does your area offer anger management classes or anxiety classes,1
im really afraid that my view of myself is reality and im really that worthless,0
i got stung with that one also he was emotionally abusive but it was my fault because of the bipolar and it drove him to be insecure!,1
i had a lot of help with taking turmeric with black pepper that being said i also had some help talking about my anxiety with someone i have gotten so worked up at my job that im having physical problems now mostly lower gi tract i wont get graphic or explain anymore luckily i have a wife who understands and is supportive i hope you are able to find someone,1
excellent medication i got really tired and drowsy in the first few weeks but wow no anxiety any more,1
proformance anxiety amay be the problem there can be anxiety along with bipolar and when they need to perform in many different areas the anxiety goes sky high and they just cant no matter how much they may want too nothing to do with love,1
cut them off! it is what i had to do with my family they knew knew more than i hospitalized twice in my teens and no one would tell me what was wrong chose instead to demonize me for using drugs (really didnt want to see me without them) knew i was sick yet chose to judge me as a horrible person and dope fiend when i finally found out and that they know all along i cut them off i dont need them,0
i have trouble understanding this (no disrespect) it was explained to me throu a medication drug trial if someone is diabetic and needs to have insulin but doesnt want to cos its medication you would be cross at them their body needs the medication to help their body as it doesnt make the insulin the same goes for depression just a different organ my brain doesnt make enough of the chemicals it needs to get me throu just like a diabetic doesnt make insulin to get them throu i even tried on meds that were to low and i just couldnt keep my head above water but now im settled on the meds that are working for me i have no desire to go back to the horrid struggles dont get me wrong things arent all peachy and good i still have struggles but im much better at managing those times the other thing i learnt was people wait to look to get help people wait 2-3 years before speaking to the doctor and they should be seeing someone after 2-3 weeks i have someone close i spoke to saying if u notice im not good u need to tell me those close know something isnt good and they are the ones that need to say something so u can seek help,0
its horrible isnt it i have all these ideas and thoughts in my head about how i could improve my life and get better but when it comes down to it im stuck and nothing changes,0
research n see if maybe in the next few stops on your route n see if u can get a bed at one of the womens shelters from there u can get resources to either get u home or get you in a place of your own what a horrible experience and i am so sorry youre going thru this stand strong and remember even when its uncomfortable anything is better than being basically held prisoner :( you can do bad all by yourself,0
it could be a medicine or combination of meds that triggering the thoughts i started taking trintellix and now im getting anxiety attacks plus other unpleasant side-effects  my last anxiety attack i forced myself to mentally walk through a place that brings me happiness a place with many happy memories attached to it i had to force myself to remember those happy memories but the attack subsided after about 15 minutes i was still very agitated though and i didnt sleep well for a couple days but even with all that it was better than the anxiety attack,1
it is one of several characteristics of bpd its not saying this is the only symptom of bpd or that only people with bpd experience this just that this is a common to a lot of people with bpd and can be very destructive as well as upsetting for both others and for person with bpd especially as quite often is not based on reality but due to bpd and its effect on individuals ability to process and regulate emotions and interpret other peoples,0
seraqual makes me sick light headed and dizzy and nausea iv only been on it for about two months 100 milagrams i started geting a rash too so i started breaking it half i didnt just want to stop like that scared of withdrawls im waiting to go to the doc so i could stop takeing it but i need something else to take its place it sucks it makes me sleep good but its just too manny side affects,1
uhyeahso sprinkle it with adhd anxiety & ptsdand its like skittles in the braintaste the rainbow,1
arielle oligny gabrielle tremblay ❤,0
thanks for sharing that im in a good place just worried ill ruin it the fact that you kept a job for 18 years gives me hope,0
they moved me because my high levels of absence (not all for anxiety but other linked reasons such as my medication to help me sleep caused me to get migraines etc) made me unreliable and they moved me to a department which could absorb my absence levels better,1
i have horrible insomnia go days without sleep,0
its not a rational decision its a release from the pressure and anxiety and sometimes from the numbing depression its being able to feel something anything when you feel nothing its to validate anxiety and stress when there is no reason for it its an irrational grab for control over anything even pain its almost always regretted as soon as it starts but it rarely even can be stopped and it is almost never for "attention" i understand and you are not alone ,0
i too am bipolar along with schizoeffect anexity and paranoid disorder i am unable to work full time due to the schizoeffect i constantly think someone is watching me or trying to hurt me my support system is my mom brother therapist and psychiatrist i take my meds as prescribed i dont advertise my illness so not too many ppl kno i dont go out often ether but since i live with my family they dont push they ask if i wanna go do something if i say no they dont pressure they ask me if i wanna go somewhere with them no one will ever understand bipolar unless they go through it in my opinion,0
im bipolar2 have border line personality disorder n schizoaffective im on 200mg of lamotrigine 1500mg of depa kote 300mg of wellbutriuin 5mg of valium i take the lamotrigine n wellbutriuin in morning n others at night n suffer horrible insomnia my mind dosent let me sleep or shut down,0
i am bipolar i have been on wellbutrin for years when i first started on it it did not come in extended release i would have break thru anxiety attacks the extended release version does not seem to cause this problem and has put my depression on hold,1
thats one ive never tried is lithium what it is for me i guess im expecting a "cure"now that you say that with the lamotrigine at least i dont want to literally rip my hair out and get very angry im just wondering if i should switch off the celexa with something else but the last time i tried that i almost ended up admitting myself! it was sooo rough! scary,0
the best advice is #1-stay on your meds its when people with our diagnosis start thinking im fine or i hate taking them that they get into trouble #2-stop feeling ashamed or thinking it is sad yes it sucks yes it is a struggle every single day dont let it define you who cares what people think? in fact i am very open about it your journey can help so many people!! ,0
sylvester is looking a bit stressed out! lol,1
lisa ill tell you what i think i think youre very beautiful no bs! you have a great completion and nice features! you have nothing to be ashamed of at all! learn to love yourself! seriously i know its hard because i feel the same way about myself but im working on it and i hope that my perception changes just like i hope it changes with you!!! do you lisa and remember that your heart ❤️ and personality are whats most important!!! i hope this helps!!!,0
another canadian here i found there are resources out there that arent used because no one refers to them check to see if you have a mental health and addictions intake centre or a mental health resource clinic in your area dont be afraid to advocate with your doctor either,1
im so sorry something so horrible happened to you so grateful you didnt succeed in killing yourself and so thankful you are willing to share your story with others dont ever doubt you make a difference in this world ❤️,0
my family is horrible also since my illness diagnosis they have only made things worse is there anyway you can distance yourself from them? getting away from them any way you can might be the best thing right now do not let them or the illness win! battle on because you are worth it even if nobody else seems to know or get it!,0
hi guillermo i have bpd and bipolar 2 with anxiety and ptsd i was fortunate in finding a therapist on the referal of a thrapist i knew socially but i think a google seach may be in order for you google bpd and it may bring up a sub search of therapists in your area,0
it takes time so allow yourself to heal cry uncontrollably scream to the top of you lungs feel sad feel broken but dont allow it to define you you are not unlovable this relationship was a part of you but its not you take this time to reflect on who you are who you want to become and reflect on what you want from a relationship if you get yourself in the right head space the next time around you will be able to bring 110% into the next relationship,0
scariest place ever,0
effexor! i was on lithium for 15 years!!! but after being attacked and not realizing the danger fast enough i realized it was the lithium it puts you in a state where you can feel neither happy or sad you just dont feel anything! not even fear since the change i feel awake!!! still have highs and lows but extreme like they were! also realizing that "all people" will disappoint you because there "people!" i have been on it for 4 years now,0
scary movie argg,0
meds can take normal emotions away it is normal to have some moods this is what i believe we are all sinners and god sent jesus to save us from our sins if we walk with god he walks with us and he challenges us to become like him but he miraculously rescues us out of our sins by daily filling us with himself in the person of the holy spirit when we repent of sin god hears us and helps us a christian live is all about relationship to god through christ a daily life of prayer and viewing our personal life through the what the bible says we can change some meds make us less caring and compassionate they can take our motivation away our mental illnesses can make us irritable and uncaring too what i am doing these days is praying to see people through gods eyes i know that god sees us all through eyes of love and understanding he is for us sometimes we just have to do the right things and trust god to give us the strength and the love to go with it god knows the motivations of the heart give thanks for what you do right feel good about every victory in becoming the person you want to become our hearts long for god and our hearts long for true caring relationships it takes effort these days to be a good neighbor we all live more isolated lives than people did one hundred years ago it takes effort to be outgoing and giving you cant do it all but we each can be giving in some way some people have all they can handle trying to be good to their family,0
yes i am trying that too i started this year went off my meds find out the meds were making me worse decicded to try other things i take a vit for your brain helps with stress memory mood and vit d3 and others also do essential oils there are recipes for all driffrent mental disorders and i found 3 for bipolar were you mix oils together and put them on your back of neck and forhead and wrist seem to help me,1
im with jeanette on this and hate when people think preaching is the answer i am saved for my sins not from pain and struggles he uses our hurts to draw us to a relationship with him but that doesnt mean it is easy; and for those with mental illness well it continues to win on some days and i am tired and dont want to talk with anyone and dont feel like fighting these disorders anymore (i have 3 diagnosis) does that mean i dont have faith? no my faith is what sent me to the hospital because at least i was in a safe place with jesus and couldnt hurt myself and going through that lost everything else - housing family friends job; faith in jesus was all i had now im going to stop having a pity party for myself and get out of this depression thanks for your help even if it took being rebellious jonah turning back to the lord,0
i in now way shape or form devalued her situation or judged her experience i told her that there are ways of living with anxiety and not to give up you dont have to be a victim i think its absolutely absurd that doctors are so quick to tell a young woman who has just admitted shes never even been to therapy that she should just give up on working and go on disability because she has anxiety am i the only one who sees the ridiculousness in this?!? her anxiety will only increase if she gives in to it and deciding not to work before even going through therapy is just ludicrous to me,0
i was a qualified nurse for 35 years with depressionanxiety and bpd but i have had to give it up as my shitty memory and dread od something going wrong did not make me a safe practioner it is knowing when to stop my mental health problems gave me more empathy with all my patients x x,1
just say youd like to try and see how you could get on without tablets and could they help you wean off them im sure you already know you cant just stop tablets and least lowering it slowly is an aim and a goal i have bpd and its rather different to bp but its the similar principle also im in the uk so im unsure how the medical practising works over there if you feel you dont need them just talk to them if youre nervous take someone with you or write a note and give them it so they can understand good luck x,0
often times a lot of ppl go through that so you are not alone i would seek out a counselor to be able to talk to someone it will help you may have to find one you like best but once u do you will find yourself being able to open up more i get paranoid about things sometimes and think someone is going to say something so i keep my mouth closed but therapy has helped me in the past i wish you the best of luck,0
i worried about my memory and my sentence structure but not sure it is just the meds or whether it is our bodies telling us to slow down and steady up i have found i have to plan and prepare now whereas before i could do anything in the blink of an eye but now if its not on the schedule i get a bit lost think its all the overthinking and hard work catching up,1
the number one thing that helped me was becoming a fur - parent i adopted a little silk maltese at 10 months oldhe is my rock ♡ on another note: i take onnit unsure if you would call it natural or not but the mood onnit really helped me out a lot i can actually sleep at night solidly,1
my boy is the same when i have panic attacks i couldnt be without him,0
i think it is hard for others to understand what it really feels like they also are very unsure about what they can do i have been anxious and have had panicky feelings for several days now and i am not sure what helps i breathe count look around the room use mindfulness but it is still present and disturbing if someone else is with me it helps be present with person is very important validating that it must be difficult is also important,0
i also take 25mg of phenergan at night paula but i am worried about weight gaindoes it cause it though?,1
they prescribed me that and prozac two weeks ago to take together and i just didnt trust it im not a pill popper im so scared of pills hell my prozac pills made things worse for me and suicidal!/: the best advice i can try and give you is maybe tylenol that puts me to sleep for some awkward reason or try doing meditation or yoga before bed i wish you much luck,0
i take 40 mg every morning im definitely handling stressful situations a little better,0
not me im afraid! been waiting 10 months for my appointment! not a new fangled mental health issue!!!!! where did that phrase suddenly appear from! it would seem everyone has a mental health problem! does anyone know the cause of this supposed problem! would be interested to know! what nonsense best wishes,0
the struggle with meds is pretty common on/off etc i dont make very good decisions when im manic what hes saying/doing might be symptoms rather than reality im not sure of course i hope things get better ,0
olanzapine? is this for anxiety?,1
if you are scared go i fight myself all the time and wish i would have gone sooner you will be ok there you will be safe dont wait,0
right on point you start doubting your sanity,1
have you seen a doctor? youre anxiety and depression may be clinical looking for relief in a relationship is a recipe for disaster you deserve medical support and a good psycoligistespecially one who understands the college stuff good luck x,1
jo i was wondering the same thing ive always struggled with the right meds for bipolar over 10 years and when i went to the hospital last year they told me i have bpd im still not being treated for it because meds dont treat it and i cant get dbt,0
each medicine can cause severe adverse effects for some paxil made me almost suicidal prozac and zoloft triggered mania rapid cycling after they would have to raise my dosages far higherhuge withdrawal fairly quickly from ssri i get brain zaps and auditory hallucinations shadows when i dont keep in my system and found out the hard way also that ones like wellbutrin are not ssri but dopamine so i had 1000% ssri withdraw and zero help for mental health after 15 years of meds ive found that lamictal is a necessity and adjusting anti depressant sometimes to very low dose when hypo mania just monitor the depths of your lows or side effects and if thats happening then absolutely dont stop with only 1 medicine i hope that you know you are beautiful courageous and strong and reaching out and talking with others that have same diagnosis also helps us release a huge trigger many of is have guilt or shame that we make others lives worse  or that anyone couldnt possibly have moods thoughts traits that we dobeing heard by others that truly understand is such a way to just release a clogged brain #dontstoptalking dont stay silent even just write thinga down and throw away and never read it again if you cant talk about anything take care of yourself #bornthisway,0
michael mueller growing up in a home with parents who both have no mental health education or formal diagnosis i can tell you the symptom that hurts children is pushing them away or causing them to feel as if you dont want them i doubt they even really notice or care that you procrastinate,0
8kg i put on now im fuckd in sweet land shake it off,0
its mealwaysbut decided to keep quiet because afraid if i tell someonethey will think i am crazy ,0
make a fruit smoothy put honey and protein powder in it  i wouldnt put her meds by the bed but take them to her with a large glass of water give the house a good clean as i feel so guilty when i come round and i see all the things ive let go in my home you could always get some relaxing music just sound no voices meditation music you should maybe go and see her docter or therapist for advice you need someone to it will help you feel stronger  depending on how bad you think this is only you will know as you know her best she might need some outside support your amazing shes very lucky to have you and im sure you feel the same about her when she comes round tell her how proud you are of her and how much you love her shell probably feel really guilty and its a very fragile time fresh air and a walk in the peaceful country side is good when shes up to it x,0
if this is how you are feeling right this minute then i suggest you go seek profesional help now not tomorrow i suffer with mixed bpd plus anxiety so i am in no position to advise otherwise good luck in getting the help you need,1
me too you are so not alone we should all​ have an at home awkward party well be together butnot,0
you have to let it go none of us are perfect and dealing with bipolar or any mental issue is such a struggle people that dont have the daily struggle have no idea how hard it can be for us im happy that you have finally found medications to help because sometimes i could take a lifetime but when you find that moment or you feel like yourself its precious dont ever let anybody else diminish your shining light,0
1 without a doubt ,0
i had that for years too but it would not help me sleep they just help with the anxiety and panic attacks i have multiple disorders and believe me i understand everyones situation here and i sympathize with each and every one its no cakewalk,1
well done that is fantastic what youve done you should be proud of yourself that took some guts and courage x i understand what its like its awful im laid awake now worrying about tomorrow and im on holiday its my first night its been a big worry for me to even come i had hoped it would get better when i got here im with some lovely friends were touring scotland it should be exciting but it isnt my anxiety is soring like you say a manic day would be a lovely rest but then it would be spoilt by the depressions afterwards what a lovely life we lead hope you keep up the driving its a big accomplishment x,0
i was a in that place for a lot of years 20+ to be honest but ive pressed the reset button in my head and hate has become peace and acceptance and most of all iove who i am today if i can say anything its this "dont be afraid of change do it dont think it and you will find your way" lucky,0
74 90% depression 90% anxiety; with symptoms of ptsd bipolar and red flag for suicide,1
having a girlfriend with bipolar i see how people act and treat her if you dont know or understand bipolar or any other mental health issues they either dont want to know or take advantage of your good nature this hurts me because people will never know the struggle and pain my girlfriend goes through she is the most wonderful amazing woman i have ever met and would not change anything ever people are uneducated and need to stop watching tv programmes and thinking every one with mental health issues are the same ,0
thank u to everyone who has responded my mothers advice was "to take the high road" and not let it affect my day easier said than done i would love to educate those who use the term so lightly but speaking up is something i have never been good at i have only opened up to a few people about being diagnosed with bipolar2 and bpd i have alienated every friend i have ever made because i could not handle "the pressure" of friendship so now i have made a friend and she uses the term bipolar for anything from her hair to the weather i try to laugh it off as ignorance but deep down it makes me feel imperfect and different from "regular people" i take mood stabilizer s and use cannabis for anxiety but still have those underlying symptoms to struggle with i have family that loves me but they will never understand the battle i am fighting with myself i guess i will have to learn how to love myself before i try to make friends and learn to let the little things go i am thankful that i am not the only one feeling this way but its a rotten feeling to feel ashamed to be me keep on keeping on much love from colorado,0
narcissism is a personality disorder the cause is unknown but believed to be influenced by parenting of a child with biological vulnerabilities is it not chemical,1
you are ill you know you are ill and are trying to get help that in itself is difficult and very brave of you for the first time ever ive been in the same situation and to be honest ive felt shame but that is the illness shaming because you and i have nothing to be ashamed about things get so overwhelming and out of control and for me i self harm to change my focus because im clearly not taking care of myself and it forces me to do that im not sure what your reason is but changing your focus is important but finding a healthy way to do that is even more important especially finding something to keep your focus that you enjoy doing art colouring reading watching tv cooking for friends asking for help dont be afraid to ask for that im not sure what relationship you have with your family but if you are close to them they will understand if not find other avenues of support you need to surround yourself with people who will stick with you and realize how difficult that level of control is or can be if you want them in your life write them a letter or sit down and talk to them tell them what you need and why tell them that you need them that you love them doing that is all you can do and sometimes knowing that you atleast tried is all you can do focus on you and your health i wish the best for you and your struggle ❤️,0
i have an alarm set to remind me to take my meds,1
i had an issue with gagging/dry heaving i dont think it had to do with my anxiety though i just had a habit of making sure i always ate in the morning before takin my meds (lithium) so it wouldnt hurt my stomach as the few times i did make that mistake it wasnt a fun morning for me i think my body just kinda associated me not eating in the morning with my experience of takin meds without food and triggered a response even though i didnt actually take my meds never happens after i eat a good meal in the morning,1
i should add that i have chronic pain from degenitive disc disease i have titanium in c4-c7 i have chronic migraine as well as due to a seizure no left collarbone so exercise is hard for me thats why im doing water therapy its so hard for me to stay active as it really gives me anxiety to be around people,0
ive been on it for what seems like forever only bad thing i noticed was some shaking on a higher dose but fine at lower doses i honestly dont know if it works i always feel like shit! i do know that you have to weened onto it because if you dont you can really sick,0
not depakote but i had to stop taking seroquel because of the restless legs/disturbed sleep i did stop the meds after consulting with my dr though always do that always consult your doctor,1
do not ever give up your medication as this is only complimentry as well as it cant get rid of the chemical imbalance that it is always take meds when its a very serious mental condition it was an horrendous time when some stupid new dr told me to stop taking some tabs and try others but stopping straight away after 20 odd years of taking them all hell broke loose panic attacks every day:( eventually after quite a while tbh they finally found the right mood stabiliser as they said i had been on anti depressents that just made me manic more they never diagnosed bi polar till 11 year ago:(,1
studies show children of women who suffered from depression (part of bipolar) during pregnancy are at risk for learning disabilities and mental health issues,1

please leave what seems important to you now is nowhere near as important as your life he will never understand your ptsd anxiety or depression he will be violent again and it will get worse he will use your issues against you he will blame his behaviors on your symptoms he will make you feel like you are nothing please dont let him have that power over you i have lost 3 homes 4 teeth suffered broken bones and bruises been choked nearly lost my life been abandonded neglected and used in all that pain and confusion you are feeling right now dig deep and find enough love for yourself to save yourself i have been homeless for over a year it sucks to no end but i am still alive and moving forward had i stayed i am confident i would not be here right now hoping with all my heart you leave before forced to endure what i have already survived i dont know your man at all i recognize every detail you gave as i have already lived it free yourself! you will be so glad you did,0
i dont know if you like animals the right now they offering and different states animal for companion i think thats the name they call and if you like animals that would be a good company for you but remember one thing the dog is going to be your company but you also got to taking care of the dog really well and i have a puppy right now and i dont feel alone anymore i used to feel like without people i can leave and now i do not want people around me anymore because i dont like noise it gets me very irritated when people being very loud around me or they arguing and im feeling better i dont miss no one,0
yepits a daily struggle and i can never predict where i will be at,0
i am actually glad i weaned off that medication it had horrible side effects for me call your doctor and leave a voicemail if you have to! i remember once i quit taking zoloft and things didnt go well (wouldnt recommend that particular medication) in the meantime see if you can purchase nerve tonic its an over the counter homeopathic medication that helps with your nerves its sold at drug stores,1
my brother sent me one: do not disturb im disturbed enough already,0

i have those same behaviors with my bipolar ptsd and panic disorder youre not alone each day is new maybe push yourself beyond your limits and not in your comfort zone to do things to help make yourself feel better baby steps small baby steps,0
i truly loved my cymbalta after it got added to my lyrica and lamictal after years of medication merry-go-round that combo was great the two were pretty ok together but after cymbalta got added in it really was a game changer i was on it for near a year with no real side effects other than a little bit of weight from the total combination i only went off to start a family my bipolar migraines fibromyalgia restless leg ptsd and gad were all responding and were in remission and well controlled it was a 3mo fight to get insurance to pay for it at the time though,0
i think the fear and anxiety you feel when thinking about death is its not that your scared of dying but leaving your family and the ones you love most behind thats what i tell myself anyway and it kind of helps a little maybe try keeping yourself busy find a hobby or something and do that when you feel a anxiety attack coming it should help x,0
as long as you are feeling more stable on your meds try not to worry about what other people say or think your are more important it is hard enough coping without their negative input stay strong and keep looking forward ,0
im on 200mg at first i got restless leg really bad on the lower dose and now at 200 they are gone i do get the munchies after i take it and ive gained weight on it but overall it seems to work for me,0

rebecca sokol i never forget about that word that you say if you would have have diabetes i used to have a therapist told me that one day think about you had ibt and if you dont take your meds you will die sounds bad day i got so scared because they told me they can cut any part of my body so for many years now im taking my meds but i still feel bad because my daughter have the same illness and she doesnt want to take her medication and we dont have no more communication she lost all her friends she lost one of her job now shes on another job because she doesnt want to take meds but youre right we need to take our mets and think about we have diabetes god bless you sweetie goodnight,0

sandra bowman benzos r indicated for the treatment of anxiety and no they wont kill u,1
this person wasnt saying to give up!!! this person was struggling themselves and had been given up on and was simply reaching out i believe not in any way saying to give up on her but rather that in his experiences people have just given up he was saying to please stick it out and just give her space( just my opinion on it),0
just got pulled off of it high blood pressure lightning migraine and stroke zone heart symptoms i also experienced a huge increase in rage,1
i have been on lithium for 18 yrs as well as my anxiety meds am 41 i am also 9 months pregnant which meant having to stop all meds while pregnant i am bipolar/manic depressive with severe anxiety i was on my meds so long i didnt and to be honest i still dont know how to function without them its been a total shit of a nightmare without them i have side effects and withdrawals from not taking them my depression has taken over my entire pregnancy and life i have 4 weeks left and counting the days until i can get back on my meds so im not only asking but begging you to not stop taking your meds sorry so long,1
i used to be on lithium  i was thirsty all the time and put on weight  when they got me on the right dose  i felt the wellest i have ever been  it was a shame i had to come off it as i had been diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic and was no longer allowed to take the lithium  i now take lamotrogine and im ok on it but not as good as i was on lithium,1
not for awhille but when i got it out was horrible,0
this year the rules are changing so most people will no longer be awarded money for depression and anxiety you have to be very very bad now and be receiving a lot of treatment and say lost ur kids for not being able to care for them then u will be able to get it otherwise 90% are going to loose benefits best thing u can do it go get help like therapy trust me if u leave work u will feel worse off as their is nothing occupying ur mind its very isolating being at home speak to the wellbeing clinic they are wonderful its all a free service and they can do so much to help so u can feel back in control again its a hard road but u have to just keep going a step at a time i wish u all the best u dont need a dr btw to see wellbeing u can refute urself which is wonderful x,0

i am against meds but it will be the best for you to be reevaluated by a different psychiatrist with a new approach give the "quick release" meds a week or two (you will be sleepy and relaxed) and if you dont feel better i would try a short term hospital stay preferably private room (noise and lots of people might escalate your anxiety) long term meds will kick in in 7 weeks and by then you should feel almost human cognitive therapy is of utmost importance psychiatrist usually work hand and hand with a psychologist 6 months and your a for a way ***i find the holistic approach favorable takes much longer but it works research: scio health4life natural healers associations good luck your not alone you will get better believe in yourself hope love faith,1
seroquel gave me horrible reactions! along with a 25# weight gain puffiness and an attempt at suicide i opted out!,0
i completely understand how you feel it is a struggle to accept that you have no control over your own feelings i have had many similiar experiences it is hurtful not being accepted because of it i have learned to not be ashamed that i have these illnesses but i still try to protect myself from shallow people,0
i have the exact same problem mate go to a doctor the should prescribe you some pills and/or cream the strong cream is called skinoren and the pills are called lymocycline they really help me and as for the people in your school just ignore them if it gets too far dont hesitate to get help if they harm you thats a completely different issue and im not gonna suggest you do what i did but good luck x,1
colleen ill listen to you ive struggled for 20 years and girl ive survived you can too!!!,0
glad to hear you are going back to therapy that is the first step you may also want to concider medications if you are not already; they have helped me a lot (diagnosed at 8 as well) in the meantimeif you feel a mood swing take a step back remove yourself from the situation and breath slowly concentrate on your body limb by limb slowly and relax; meditation can help too it sounds silly but it can work the self harm will be more tricky it helped me to keep my hands busy during triggering situations i took up knitting crocet and drawing it also helps distract from the anxiety giving you something manual to concentrate on,1
keep ur phone with u set ur alarm to the time u take ur meds the time u take them is crucial,1
having many symptoms again things have gotten very stressful and ive already blown up several times this week,0
pushing people away is part of the illness there are a lot of symptoms in what you said that are very common i am concerned that you are still working though what part of the world are you living in can you not take sick leave and get sickness pay from the level of stress that youre under i would suggest reducing your working hours i know its tough but sometimes you need to do it i reduced my working week about 10 years ago and it has helped me no end i would also try and find a group that you can go to say through a charity that deals with mental health you may be able to talk it out with them depression is a dreadful animal and it makes you more and more isolated this is a vicious circle i have had depression all my life ive learnt to deal with it the good and the bad if you ever want to inbox me and have a chat online im more than happy to do that,0
i can relate to almost everything listed ive been diagnosed with ptsd aboutt 20 years ago everyday is a new adventure everyday a different struggle,0
very true with people that have depression/anxiety,1
as you probably know by now you are not alone reading this made my chest cave a bit and a hotness run through my body what you just described was me all week last week they can teach us how to control our breathing all day but they have yet to teach me how to stop the uncomfortable heart beats the numbness in my hands the sickness in my stomach and the tears that just want to roll down if ever you need someone to talk to in the midst of these small (or large) episodes i am here to hear you out do small things for yourself hun even a small dry erase note to yourself on the mirror can give you hope to push through the day i have a huge collection of notebooks that i never use but just thinking of what i can put in them makes me happy i painted a ceramic cupcake with my daughter in the midst of my small attack (she has no idea what i go through ive made it a point to myself i would never let her see my struggle) and that alone helped me relax a bit tiny things babe we will all push through this together,0
so true people need to know more about this problemand stop to think that we are all humanand we have feelingsjust at times alot stronger and confusing ,0
abilify did absolutely nothing butbmake me worse i had no energy on it the hallucinations and paranoia got worse andso did the depression plus it caused me to have chest pains that were directly related to the medication being combined with another med i was only on it for 4 weeks but that was a miserable 4 weeks,1
julie i cant even begin to imagine what you go through on a daily basis so im not gonna say that i do but for whatever its worth i acknowledge your pain and your fears for all of life uncertainties your reasons are valid but please dont allow that to take time away from today but most importantly from this moment cherish every valuable minute that can be spent loving your loved ones,0
see i dont deal well neighbors are you an upstairs neighbor? well if you are stomping around really loud upsets them a lot id slam my door extremely hard when they would do it id even put my bass stereo on the floor and play whatever loud music youd like but my advice is prolly not the best i dealt with young party girls moving in an out all the time and i just ended up getting really passive aggressive towards them like they took up all 9 spots we had in the lot for their friends so i just parked my car where they couldnt get out,0
i lost a great friend last month he got drunk and hung himself he had little kids just a waste and we are all left to pick up the pieces and feel sad down guilty and just hopeless to do anything the dead are gone the living are left to hurt,0

there is strong evidence to support bipolar runs in families this true in mine without getting personal as some members are still alive but a very close relative has just been diagnosed get the help now even if your fears are unfounded good luck,0
brenda chapman also i never said lithium didnt work it is proven to be the most dangerous you disagree thats your problem and if you die of lithium toxicity due to your ignorance about the dangers of it thats on you lithium worked amazingly for managing my bipolar anger it works amazingly for most people but that doesnt mean its worth the risks all i stated was that it was the most dangerous and effexor is proven one of the least likely to give side effects you can disagree with those facts all you want but thats just ignorant,1
when im overwhelmed i just pull away the few channels and connections that need to be made are kept going as they are a necessity other than that there might be some hard decisions that you just have to make in your favor we need some wins i hope my little rant was not bothersome i have my own mental illnesses everyone has their own this works for me if it works for someone else great if not sorry,1
i have to share this because we are talking about lithium my brother was on a diuretic for high blood pressure and the psychiatrist put him on lithium the two should have not been given together they together caused his kidneys to fail but before they did he swelled up in his abdomen legs scrotum and private parts so much with water that water was seeping from his skin and his skin was splitting open a nursing home did not know what was going on he got admitted to a hospital and they called in a kidney specialist and he knew exactly which diuretic he was to have with lithium on the right diuretic he lost forty pounds of fluid they were killing him with the wrong meds,0

tracy hypomania for me manifests in anger rage irritability and wanting to yell and scream and throw things and punch people in the throat its so much different than mania i dont get super highs super creative and go on major spending sprees sometimes the hypomania also gets mixed with depression too it is really awful im in the middle of hypomania right now i have such hate and anger going on it sucks and im going through a divorce so im that doesnt help hes been lying and cheating for 9 months!! the bastard,0

please see your gp asap you dont have to struggle alone talk to someone about how you are feeling there are options if you dont want to see a doctor - maybe lifeline?,0
i have bipolar 2 im also on lamictal i take it with my lithium i would think that as long as the medication is working and its treating the bipolar i would try not to stress too much about if its for bp one or two,1
ive been on that combo for about 4 years now its honestly the only combo to work for me ive been on almost every med they make and was diagnosed bipolar 2 when i was 13 i also have 3 children the seroquel xr wasnt for me it made me feel like i have restless leg syndrome i hope you find that it works as well for you,1
word! in my case fatigue insomnia guilt the hardest to handle and judgementbut not others my own,0
i set an alarm on my phone to help me remember,1
i take 1200 milligrams of seroquel does out 3 times a day if i would have stopped taking the seroquel i would have major withdrawals which is what sounds like what youre going through if you havent spoken to your doctor about coming off the seroquel i suggest that you do so and you two can make a plan to slowly come off of it to avoid having withdrawal symptoms,0
it has been a long struggle for me when i finally got my diagnosis i was in my late 40s it took a few more years to get the right cocktail and even then the meds have had to be adjusted but i dont think i would go back the next biggest hurdle is to change my mindset things will not always be so negative i cannot live this way and the only way i can do that is within myself i can make the choice to be miserable or take steps to change how i look at life ive lived my life for 59 years being miserable it is time i changed that! i have an amazing support system that is helping me,0
i think you are reacting to the word imbeciles well if he does not understand the "point" i believe he has little to no understanding of the needs of people diagnosed with mental illness you maybe do not understand the daily myths and stereotypes that i and others deal with everyday because others do not understand the"point" education of society is the overall point but daily to find support can be exceedingly difficult so what is your "point"? words too big maybe stupid idiot or dumb would help you understand because i do not believe you get the "point" either if you do not believe people with a mental illness typically are isolated in society desperately need support from people who have experienced the degradation of these illnesses and can be helpful and insightful,0
so i have bipolar 1 and a few other diagnoses like many people depression occurs more often than mania there is new research (just google stimulant use with depression or bipolar) that shows stimulant medications may help stimulants do not fix the depression but do provide some energy that helps kick start behaviors that help deal with depression i can only take it for 2-3 days because of the mania that can occur however it is not unheard of to use stimulants this way also a doctor is always the best place to start i wish any medications worked for me it takes me lots hard work to deal with my past to change my behavior and willingness to sit through the misery if someone can get help through medication please accept the help dont sit in misery you dont deserve,1
i have ptsd ocd borderline disorder bipolar disorders psychosis and add i also have a husband in a wheelchair and a child prayer and the rosary are my anxiety meds i take like 15 meds but prayer and gods healing are what gets me through,1

ive been with my husband for 3 years & let me tell you weve been thru a lot of struggles dealing with finances we have both come to realize that monetary things are not as important as just being together the most important things come from the heart not the wallet,0
this is not unique to any kind of mental illness and the suggestion that it is could be quite damaging to anyone reading it this is a great page by and large but i do wonder if some members ability to sort the wheat from the chaff is somewhat lacking at times fear of the unknown is perfectly normal but obsessing over things which might not come to pass might not be,0
i have bipolar anxiety and an eating disorder i am always available to chat if ever you feel it,1

i use an app called medisafe you set your meds and doses up put it in as a daily reminder (tick every day) and you will get three reminders for each dosing time i use the app to keep track of my pill count as well you put in what your dose is in simple terms eg half a tablet 3 capsules etc how many tablets/dose are left and you can set however many days/pills you want to be notified before youre out and need a refill it will alarm daily until you have completed the task good luck! xx,0

for me massage therapy works wonders on my body getting regular massages can really help with the pain associated with depression/anxiety drinking lots of water can aid in the muscles not being as tight when the pain is bad and i cant get to a massage session i take ibuprofen but be careful as too much can mess your stomach up oh and get a new doctor this one that you have is wrong,1

never be ashamed ive been fighting bipolar and anxiety since 1st grade and got diagnosed with it a couple years ago the best thing you can do is get help i waited too long to get myself help and it affected my life my relationships friendships you name it so i highly recommend getting help asap definitely see a psychiatrist and request cognitive behavioral therapy they work wonders!,1
jeanette i have to disagree with you i am on a medication called vyvanse it is similar to adderall but it slowly goes up levels off and peaks down it helps me clarify my thoughts because i have bipolar and also anxiety disorder as well as adult add it does give me a little bit more energy to be able to proceed with my day so that is not 100% true,1
just afraid to live,0
i have bp and sadly so does my 16 year old daughter we both struggle but she struggles with it worse than i do theres nothing worse than seeing ur child in so much pain and not be able to "fix" it it sucks but i love her more than anything in this world its just me and herwe are close but we have our moments been struggling with this sinse she was about 7,0
pretty sure they can only do that if you admit you want or plan to harm yourself if you explain to your therapist your dreams just how you did here im sure it will be ok i cant imagine how stressful and unsettling those dreams must be it would be good to talk to her about it,0
what are the symthoms of anxiety,1
i was diagnosed major depression with psychosis in 2011 - 2016 five years i got seroquel 200mg every night and it ruined my periods the psychiatrist told me that i dont need meds any longer but a year after that ive become anxious and suspicious towards others i believe that other people will hurt me leave me taking advantage of me betray me backtabbing me sometimes i talk gibberish cant even make proper coherent sentence acusing anyone else for creating such a plot to humiliate me throwing & smashing things this april 2017 i was taken to a new psychiatrist because i was unable to live a day without being angry and suspicious she gave me new meds : merlopam® 2 (lorazepam 2mg) abilify® (aripiprazole 5 mg) arkine® (trihexyphenidyl hcl 2mg) which i must drink at night before i sleep because the pills make me lose coordination between my mind and body i cant walk or move in balance until the effect is wearing off to be honest i hate taking meds im so sick of meds: pills capsules syrups i used to drink meds since i was 5 years old for physical illness and now i have to take meds for my mental illness its like i spent the most years to take meds but i have to admit : i need it its hard for me to simply admit that i need professional help better drinking meds than getting electro convulsive therapy (ect) once every 2 days like when i was hospitalized in 2011 but when i did admit that i need help everything seems to work in the right path ive just been taking new three meds i mentioned above for three days its hard to get back to the routine : drinking meds after a year free of meds i thought i could survive without meds but the recent problematic events had made me depressed again so i have to admit it : i need help i need meds i need psychotherapy i hope these will help i hope someday ill recover and i wish you all the best too for now i simply think this way : "if i wanna survive without killing myself i must take these meds because my family and friends love me because they dont wanna lose me i do this for them i do this for me too because i wanna save myself" voila! i succeeded drinking meds yeay! maybe now the meds havent shown any progress just yet but someday they would meds for mental illness need at least 3 months before i really feel the good effect so i will keep drinking these until i feel better and i must believe that these pills will make me better it takes time but its worth it someday and somehow,1
all the time take meds and struggle daily some days are better than other,0
i am so so proud of you for talking yourself down its not an easy thing to do i understand your fears for future episodes but focus on the positive you managed to say "no screw you" and that is the hardest thing to do make yourself a hot drink turn on a movie and look after yourself and relax you did so well ❤️ ,0
it can be so hard sometimes when each partner has a mental health condition as you are in the us (im in uk) im unsure what professional support you have access to ive read lots of posts from people in the us and usually no mention is made of any support they are receiving so it might be that the only help available is therapy which you have to pay for supporting someone else with a mental health problem can be exhausting in itself and if you are suffering too then it can be twice as hard im sure on one of your good days it is far easier and it can be very rewarding and therapeutic for you i often thought that while i was helping others i wasnt focussing on myself which was a good thing as mental illness can seem very self centred sometimes which can be pretty hard to deal with im sure you are a wonderful support to your boyfriend and you appear to be really helping him move forward and gain the strength necessary to socialise and make new friends im sure it is sometimes very tiring for you hopefully with every good positive experience your boyfriend has this will help him learn to manage and hopefully eventually cope better with his anxiety which sometimes it can be crippling id like to think as he learns to move forward this would help you too sometimes when we are struggling ourselves we dont always have the energy to effectively support someone else too when we need all our strength for self preservation to look after yourself you ideally need help do you have family or friends you can lean on? theres no easy answer unfortunately recovery from both isnt easy it takes a lot of strength and determination some days we have those some we dont it can seem a huge mountain to climb sometimes but small steps are the key small but significant goals are important you are doing a wonderful job by the sounds of things but try to get help and take care x,0
hello everybody my name is dan i suffer from depression & anxiety ive had counselling & it comes back to abandoned issues ive recently come back from the states after being with my fiancé for 10 weeks she has "something" but hasnt been diagnosed yet im not going thro the good & bad times we had but she was having such a negative impact on my life that i had to call it off & would remain friends i cant do the friends thing after being intimate with someone ive tried for the last 2 months & she isnt the person she once was weather its because of the change of meds or whatever i slowly got no answers to questions & finally not even reading my messages this is day 2 that i havent messaged her & she hasnt messaged me it is very hurtful but im not "cutting" or planning suicide (2 attempts) so i am doing well even if i dont feel like it i guess just enjoy your dates make no future plans enjoy their company while your with them  if i read this back to myself it probably wont make any sense but i tried to help somebody else out & thats going to be my happy thought for the day everybody regardless of what you have or havent got im a person that doesnt judge you all the best to "yall" ✌️ love&peace from little new zealand ,0
my winning combo is lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder remember what works for one doesnt necessarily work for another and it may take time to find the right meds it took me 18 mths of trial and error,1
i think first of all you must have a happy life before deside to try a quit medications i been trying sometimes and i am trying right now but i am very calm and "happy" that helps but i notice i get upset more easy than with medication  good luck,1
thank you his school has his psych and therapist which he sees 2x a week and then when needed i go 1x a week or more if needed i want to just fix him i am his best friend and that breaks my heart we do everything together which in turn can be trying on my patience i then have to take some time alone and regroup i have other boys so they all need something the process is so very slow for recovery but he has improved beyond words over the past year so i have to focus on that i just see that he gettting depressed since hes almost 17 and just not able to do what the others are doing you wrote a beautiful response and i appreciate that i wish there were group for parents like aa meetings so we can meet others seems many parents are reserved about their children with illnesses we are open about it as i feel this is nothing to be ashamed of i fought for years to finally get him into the school he is in and its been the best thing for him the problem with the school is that he wont let himself connect with any of the kids there as he says they are all "weird" but they are all like my son some worse some not but he cant accept the he has a disability and keeps fighting it i am hoping once he accepts it and just knows that the anxiety is his norm for now he may enjoy life a little more,0
6 hours sometimes isnt enough when my anxiety starts i will not leave the house :(,1
with bpd sometimes medication isnt helpful you can have it to help with the anxiety & depression with it but the actual illness is about learning coping strategies and dbt therapy ~sandi~,1
i have bipolar i severe with psychotic features ive gotten so psychotic before that police had to get a switchblade knife out of my hands fortunately it was closed or they might have shot me i was so paranoid and thought they were going to kill me it was terrible i seem to be doing well on my meds these days never miss a dose dont want to end up in jail again,0
caused sedation nausea restless legs tremors and grogginess all day long even taking it the night before i felt like a slave to it so glad im off it now,0
i couldnt have said it better!!! im constantly telling myself that what i am staying upset over is petty but its the letty things that stick and are hard to let go of,0
took it for anxiety before i knew i was bipolarwent hypomanic for the first time at age 40 now i need mood stabilzier and antidepressant ( bipolar type 2),1
theres some genetic components but ive watched documentaries and read books where they explain that people with the genetics can be non bipolar the gene can lie dormant in you and trauma or stress can trigger it,0
pill organizers work for me or setting an alarm on your phone so you take it at the same time everyday,1
in my experience i was against opening the can of worms and very frightened about facing my demons from the past but now five years on from opening up and twenty five years on from the major issue i know it had to happen never dealing with the issue properly means it just smoulders just below the surface never going away never being properly addressed yes its tough yes its painful but i believe we cant truly move on and build a future until the issues have been faced head on the counsellor or therapist will be trained empathic and non judgemental they will gently help you through the whole process together until you can come to be able to process the difficult issues effectively so you can properly rebuild and regain your life you dont deserve to suffer anymore x,0
i have taken propranolol as a prn for anxiety and it worked well and it didnt cause any drowsiness,1
im 36 years old and my family literally has to lock me in sometimes because my bpd is flared the back privacy fence is screwed shut and the front gate can be locked i dont have a key im very irrational when im cycling there is no way i could work im trying for disability,0
it usually "blows"through high blood pressure or bleeding ulcers better to to find "relaxation response" or a "funny movie" ,1
aww i think thats really not nice to say this person is obviously struggling and looking for some help bashing them down due to being a certain site is not very nice and wont help this person in any way what so ever even if it is just a bipolar site anxiety still come with bipolar and would think that anyone who has suffered this would understand this persons emotional state people going through this should support each other not bash them down it dont hurt to show a little sympathy and support knowing how it feels xxx,0
you can always call a distress line mental health or even go to an er,0
i am guilty of all the above and it aggravates my family when they need me to remember,0
i used to hear voices but it was my own i have bpd major depression social and generalised anxiety but you could have anything between bpd bipolar and schizophrenia,1
im on zoloft which only took the edge off my depression and did nothing for my anxiety at all i was put on gabapentin for anxiety which does seem to help me but things didnt get "right" for me until they put me on wellbutrin (with zoloft & gabapentin at the same time) now i feel normallike i did before all the depression and anxiety hit me you just have to keep trying different meds until you find something that works for you im sorry that youre dealing with this :( its so hard sometimes,1
i sought help for my self mutilation as well after 6 yrs of hurting myself i saw a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety that was triggering depression/ cutting episodes i got put on zoloft and let me tell you best decision ive ever made i still experience mild anxiety but i feel no urge to hurt myself now,1
i have experienced this psychotic depression and it seems so real but you have to remember its sleep depravation best thing i did was get on to you tube and look at guided meditation for insomnia anxiety depression etc there are loads or sleep depravation and then go and make yourself comfy choose jason stephenson or the honest guys and listen to them and do the breathing you will find over time you will fall asleep at the beginning of the meditation and gradually catch up on your sleep but if you consider self harm then you must dial 911 or suicide prevention or the samaritans tomorrow is another day and things can get easier i no longer have conversations with animated trees they are just trees but at the time they were my very real pals remember it is a chemical imbalance we have often caused by burnout and exhaustion it screws up the seratonin and it takes time to recover but you can you really can,1
my boyfriend set an alarm on his phone to remind me it helps,1
i take 5 once a day at night it helps overall but in certain situations i still get anxious and upset,1
we do a pill box as everyone else has stated you can also set alarms on your phone when to take them as a reminder if you have someone close or a spouse set alarms on both phones so if you forget or miss it someone can tell you or call to remind you hope all is well for you,1
sometimes the hardest thing is communicating sometimes people are ready and willing to put themselves in your shoes but they cant do that unless you take them off and hand them over by that i mean sharing what you are thinking and feeling even if you are embarrassed or ashamed of it if all you do is grunt "im not feeling well" your friends and loved ones cant imagine whats going on in your head you have to share and thats difficult because anxiety wants to hide you dont want to be judged you dont want to "bother" anyone screw it: if someone close to you has made the effort to ask whats wrong make the effort to tell them honestly dont let your illness make you push people away,0
its not bullshit! you cant make comments like that unless youve been in the situation which i personally have! it doesnt say everyone with a mental illness has addiction its saying they are at a much higher risk of addiction also addiction can be other things than substance abuse gambling addiction and food addictions are just some other examples,0
yep they will never understand the struggle,0
hi there sounds as though things have been dreadful for you of late i guess to try to answer some of those questions; id need to ask some of my own im wondering first if you now live on your own? do you have people around to support you? do you still have close family around and you talked about your mum originally? do you have any professional support? are you taking any medication? sorry for the questions but i dont want to suggest anything which might offend or hurt it probably wont help to read this but most of the feelings you describe sound very familiar and common with mental health problems these extreme feelings which of course are worrying and real im wondering if you have left home and gone away to study? has your support network gone? if you are at college or university (forgive me for the terminology as im thinking you could be in the us and im in the uk) is there any support at your place of study? we can be so unkind to ourselves when we are suffering we can blame ourselves when it is all beyond our control are there any wellbeing courses or workshops you can access? the road to recovery involves several things which when you are in the midst of the turmoil can appear to be too much of a mountain to climb but it is possible and usually involves small but significant achievable steps but we need to lean on people and we need people who can support us reaching out to people on these sites is a really good first step explaining how you feel xx,0
r u really serious i used to know an awesome professional but i dont really know them anymore fear is a disease in it self thats what some ancient ansesstors believed but who knows thats way in the past also trust in yourself,0
becca thomas go you for graduating from college and that goes to show how very strong you are mine is struggling to get through high school learn your limits and dont put yourself in a situation that will cause anxiety if you go out drive so you can leave when you wanti have learned through the years watching my son struggle that there are good days bad days and so so day my heart goes out to you i see how anxiety can get the best of you,0
i need to ask my doctor for an adhd test because ive already been diagnosed with bipolar 1 generalized anxiety ptsd and borderline personality i have so many of the symptoms associated with adhd but i just dont know what to say or how to bring it up to my dr,0
no thats bullshit marijuana is just like any other psychotropic drug - pharmaceuticals included it can work well for some people and horribly for others just because something works or doesnt work for you doesnt mean it will work or not work for others,1
this could not be truer i so badly want to run away but how do you run away from your own mind mental illness sucks every hour of every day is a battle you know life isnt that bad you want to be happy but it just dont happen that way so you get aggregated at yourself you know others have it worse so you feel selfish to feel the way you do therefore guilt starts building i just want to scream i want to be normal i want a break so i look at the day hour by hour just to make it through and tell myself everything is fine im just tired if you are struggling with mental illness i want to say keep trying and you are so much stronger than you give yourself credit for,0
it does take time to find the "right" therapist for you you have to be able to trust that person and be able to build a repore a relationship between the two of you sometimes it takes a while to find that right one there is patient/therapist confidentiality if you did anything to this guy stopping short of a felony you shouldnt have to worry about it i found it very helpful to write down my story pour your mind and heart out on sheets of paper read it feel it know that it is you on those pages holding all your anxiety bottled up will do nothing but eat you from the inside out as it is now its ok to see a therapist once or twice and decide if you are comfortable or not they will not take it personally it took me several years to find the right therapist who had the right modalities and approach to really set me free from my issues it may take you some time to find the best fit but dont give up!!,1
amber i understand when i was first got sick and a few times in between the road is quite bumpy its not a good journey and very scary you are probably the first person that he lashes at because he loves you and youre the closest person to him you need to take care of yourself as well especially if you suffer with depression sometimes you will have to distance yourself if you can for self-preservation the best medication for me has been lithium plus amisulipride and duloxeteine i think the lithium is a universal med and available in the us it is one of the older types of medication but it is reliable and it works well maybe it will be worth having a conversation with the doctor tomorrow about it ,1
great post i am currently weaning off remeron on to effexor and was scared  but im following all the dr said,0
shakir,0
i suffer alorvof stress / tension headaches so yes there is a causal link,1
ive had this since i was 12 both the anxiety and depression this hasnt been an easy decision for me i dont want to give up but even if i go on pip for a few years until im mentally stable and ready for work then i will but for now its what i believe is best i am waiting to get an appointment for a counsellor but not heard anything back,0
hey mee to i told my mom and she to this day doesnt believe it i also question me and also its affected my relationships i have kids but when im with them i stress in a way that it distracts me but hey i would like to be your friend,0
animal (with rob schneider) i was upset i wasted time and money i walked away feeling stupid for actually watching til the end in hopes it would get better,0
i didnt know other people also experience the physical pain sensation during the times anxiety is high i dont like being touched when my anxiety is super high or when im super depressed my bf will try to rub my back out of compassion but i always dont like the feeling i have bpd too,0
yes this is so me ive been struggling since i was thirteen years old im now 29,0
a good psyc dr can help as well as a tharapist i would find some right away its hard to treat anxiety  im on 6 meds for bipolar one but my anxiety is really bad ,1
first off good for you for recognizing that this med was a horrible fit for you! however it is always best to call your psychiatrist/prescriber when you see such drastic and crippling changes and they should listen and take you seriously and help you get off of it if they dont time for a new doc but if youre ever experiencing such crippling side effects especially thoughts of any sort of harm to yourself or others you have to call and they have to listen and advise accordingly immediately not expect you to wait and suffer until your next appointment,1
i felt the same way up until last year my dad took me to a krav maga class and i learned how to defend myself the first time i had to hit the other womans padded bag i broke down in tears the instructor came over and encouraged me to hit and keep hitting i was sobbing the whole time but it really helped now i know where to hit an attacker what will bring him/her down quickly it was so empowering that im now able to leave the house i still get some anxiety when coming home late from work but i remember what they taught me muscle memory and to immediately react if attacked,0
i really got irritated yesterday when someone posted in summation that weight gain is a small price to pay for mental health ummmm no! if said weight gain worsens depression and anxiety then it is not a small price to pay we have enough problems without having to fight a battle against the scales,1
i find that i get ridiculously angry over nothing like scary angry! then i can be laughing about the same thing an hour later im constantly tired no matter how much sleep i get ive had suicidal tendencies before not so much now though i hate everything and everyone and i dont have a filter if i have something to say i say it even when i know i shouldnt! i constantly worry about the smallest things yet the bigger things do t bother me as much im obsessed with detail i need to know everything about everything im exhausted from trying to act normal,0
wisdom and knowledge are two different things i am fighting with all my heart it the mind who is against me my feelings are scary even for me i must hide them otherwise i will scare people horribly,0
im glad i had the opportunity to have been in a 20 year marriage i just wish hed been strong enough to have stood by me to find out what was wrong with me ((i was diagnosed during the divorce but symptoms were there for many years) now i am afraid no-one will want to deal with my issues not that anyone is even looking to get to know me without knowing about them so i figure ill grow old and die alone,0
nikki shamell ,0
it takes work but you can beat it and live a normal life my daughter is 18 and has anxiety depression and ibs and she wasnt diagnosed until she was 15 after her daddy committed suicide she is doing good in college works full time it took her time to get the right combination after meds what im saying is dont give up hope or loose your dreams because you can overcome this it is possible,1
panic attacks anxiety attacks is not good im just thankful my medication works cause mine get so bad i end up at the er,1
my first thought is get to your dr asapand let them know what you are feelingit has been reported that infusions of ketamine will eliminate suicidal thoughts for up to a weekdont know if that will work for you but i would askyour obsession is sort of like a seisurenot likely to get better on its ownwont pretend to know what you are going throughbut some ssris can cause these thoughts (known in people under 20 yrs old)might ask to switch to another ssrimy symptom is fear not suicide,0
be careful asking for advice on meds to take here everyone is different and what works for 1 wont necessarily work for you its a trial and error thing and something you must work closely with your dr on it took me 18 mths to get the right combo i can say one thing drs are reluctant to pres robe benzodiazepines because they lose their effect if used long term so you need more and more and they are addictive great for short term use but thats about it talk to your dr about cognitive behavioural therapy it has been great for me as it has given me tools to help myself i have bipolar i and anxiety disorder,1
self harm does not generally mean that someone is hurting themself in order to kill themselves - people who self harm generally do as a copies mechanism to deal with distress hurt pain or to actually feel something it doesnt mean they are at the point of suicide  these are things that can distract until the urge or compulsion to harm calms down rather than burn or cut yourself for instance and leave permanent damag or harm its to try and find something that does not cause permanent damage such as ice cubes drawing on arms with red paint or excercise etc,0
this is true my son had the genetic components but trauma (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified his doctors have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense definitely can be a combination ,1
one thing i will say because no one else seems to have the ability to say it"what we see in others is sometimes how we view ourselves past or present they are mirror images of who we were at one time or who we feel we might start to become and if we do not allow ourselves to look for anything good in someone we will only see the bad how we allow others to affect us is on us and our own conscience most times what people say to us we may see as a slam against us and we feel guilty which is why we react to it as we do but if we look deep within ourselves we will maybe see a little truth to it and no one seems to be able to handle viewing themselves as the bad person it doesnt mean we should give up and lose ourselves deeper into darkness it simply means we should search further into ourselves and find a way to become a better person no one is perfect not one person we all have flaws but taking to heart what others say to us may either be who we really are or who they really are arguing with people or claiming you are more righteous than they are leaves hurt feelings and damaged egos you cant help fix a situation by yourself but you cant expect others to do all the work either no one should bow down to each other but it doesnt hurt to discuss feelings in a calm and loving manner either anger yelling and screaming gets us no where with each other,0
i struggled with the same kind of thing whether it was school or work i eventually ended up going on ssi,0
thank you i needed to hear this i will consider this step a lot more seriously now but i want to try fighting a bit more on my own just for a bit longer i want to see if i can get through but i wont hesitate if it gets that bad again thank you,0
its only a sufferer u knows wat it feels lyk bt wen non sufferers say wat getting hyper for wat u worrying? thats wen i lyk to take my sandals and hit them,0
im sure hes well aware that he needs to be with his son and handle his finances smh his post is pretty much saying he is struggling with that and would like some advice and support seeing that this is what this page is for your ignorance on everyones posts pisses me off lady why you here? to tell ppl to just calm down and shut up?? if things were so simple wed just do it wouldnt we?? ugh! anyway to the man who wrote this post fonzie it truly must be hard being a father and struggling to provide the weight of the world hey? im so sorry your going through this im sure you are trying your best sometimes the government can help in financial situations depending what country you live seeing your doctor may help you some light medication and maybe some therapy mate sounds like a tough time for you and i hope your relationship issues can be resolved its hard but never give up,0
talk to your doctor i have depression and anxiety been on logynon ed for quite a few years now and never had any problems i was lucky in the sense that this was the 2nd pill i tried so i didnt have to go through countless prescriptions to find the right pill for me,1
i set an alarm on my phone to go off at the time im supposed to take my med,1
its us a struggle as a parent of a child with multiple mental illness the struggle is real and also affects the other siblings in my family but i take it day by day and 1 step at a time with that being said it is beneficial to seek help i have done that with my daughter and it gives her multiple outlets and multiple people she can turn to for help,0
deep breaths  what triggered your panic attack?? if you feel the need to cut use a pin and draw where you would have cut,1
im on ssdi because of my severe depression anxiety and suicidal ideations i too am 37 now but got disability 3 years ago if they can prove that you cant work due to your illnesses then you will be ok but know that it is a long process youll get denied several times off the bat i would recommend you find a good attorney who wont charge you unless you win they wont take your case if they dont think you will get it best of luck to you,1
i got free help at a state run facility while i was in utah i let slip that i was considering suicide a few years ago my mom saw and got scared she called my university health center they called the cops the cops paid me a visit and go me in not the preferred route but i got the meds i needed and the only thing i was required to do was to go to a group therapy session once a week didnt matter which one i just signed in and it counted i would highly suggest going to the nearest department of health and welfare and explaining the situation it may take you a few days it may not to see a doctor but theyll get you squared away do you have any family the kids can stay with in the area? it might be better for them; they wont get lost in the system you can see them whenever and they wont have to see you go through this theres also the possibility that during one of your drunken moments you hurt one by accident (i dunno if youre a mean drunk or not) you have to ask yourself do you really wat you two precious little kids to see you do this to yourself?,1
first of all i am so sorry for your loss and i am sending prayers <3 i take 100mgs of zoloft and it just feels "normal" for me i still get angry sad anxious etc i am also on 1mg of xanax i hope that you are ok <3,1
i understand im struggling mentally and im definitely tortured inside,0
everybodys different in what medication works for them especially psychiatric medications i had to go through several before i finally found the right mixture pristiq lexapro klonipin and trileptal klonipin is the least important on the list because really it only helps during the times my anxiety starts getting out of control like before i go to work i find klonipin works like a band-aid that easily comes off because the effect is temporary having an anti-depressant or mood stabilizer really helps prevent the anxiety from coming back as often and not be so horrible i hated medications too but i found out that they definitely help me function much easier and keep a job n such but again everyones different i hope you find some peace ✌,1
yes welcome to our club of family denial wasnt until my 2nd hospitalization and the change my husband and children saw in me i became a functioning wife and mother again and are thrilled to see me out if my bed in a daily basis still have my panic attacks occasionallyband can get manic at times but the clonzepam can even that out dont ever let anyone tell you its not real or its a cop out shake it off or go for a walk its a chemical imbalance nothing to be ashamed of took years of er visits until finally someone got me the help i needed i got so tired of trying to explain bipolar manic depression panic anxiety disorder to everyone i printed out material on it and gave it to them to read those who cared did those who didnt are not in my life anymore we have a hard enough time trying to deal with our illness and managing ourselves let alone having to try and babysit the "well" people through it tell them to get a support group and educate themselves my kids could tell you anything about my mental illness today and are not ashamed,0
and for god sake dont tell her shes faking it like my otherhalf just did when having a panic attack,0
i think there is an element of guilt ya carry cause there is a chance and no its not certain or what the future holds for you and them i had my kids before my diagnosis and after everything ive gone through they are my world but i feel awful for what theyve been through and have 2 go through because of me plays heavy on my heart but there is no right answers just what you think is right for you,0
try autism ptsd anxiety bipolar i think ill die twenty years before i should :(,1
this is pretty judgemental yes get her to a doctor asap we all have trouble with difficult decisions especially when we are struggling ourselves,0
you say he`s not medicate is he in counseling/therapy? have you attended such with him? if not that might be an option or maybe find a group to try? certain meds did that to me thank god my dr decided that class of drugs doesn`t help me also have you tried positive stress relief? basically any safe legal activity that makes him smile laugh or feel accomplished have you ruled out medical problems? i don`t like to admit it but some of us need medicated the right meds schedule is a better for me than fighting it all the time to just scrape by,1
i take seroquel and ambien and i still struggle to sleep but it did get better when i got prescribed ambien,1
every damned day! the thing is even though i have mental ill health i am generally a happy person and i try to show it on the outside so only a few people know what goes on inside my head if people know the true extent of what goes on they would be genuinely worried (and possibly quite scared) so i dont let people know most of the stuff i think many others are in the same boat as well which is quite sad,0
does insurance cover this? ive thought about ect and struggle with bipolar disorder,0
all those are me to a tyet im remain undiagnosed i have manic depression and high anxiety and insomnia,1
into 13 years of marriage diagnosed with bipolar depression anxiety 9 years ago my husband doesnt understand my illness but he separates my meds goes to dr but refuses to read up,1
your meds or find alternative medicines that might help you exercise diet meditation its hard at the beginning but these things have worked for me if you ever want to private message me im here ive gone through a lot of therapys ive done emd are i done speech therapy ive done medication ive done therapy three times a week for three hours a day ive done meditation ive exercised for 19 years i dont juice fasting diet changes herbs minerals epson salt bath mineral springs yoga hot yoga i have thought the illness with all my might and my results have been what ive expected it hasnt been easy at times and there has been times that i wanted to give up but looking back now im glad that i tried everything and that im here you will be glad to it just takes time and things will get better i promise sorry about my spelling i have dyslexia so at times i dont spell correctly i tell people what my illnesses im not afraid i was embarrassed for a very long time i tell everybody that meets me if they want to know and if im depressed ill let people know that im not feeling well so i could get what i need i learned to tell people what i need because people are not mind readers and only you know exactly what you need at the time,0
it gives me restless legs and dont even make me sleepy,0
if you struggled with voices illusions suicide and huge stages of depression you would do a lot of blow drinking and drugs to have a little sunshine in your life too bipolar sucks live strong,0
i took it all through out my pregnancy the doctor said it was safe and it was important for me to be stable while i was pregnant than to risk an episode that could be dangerous i now have an amazing healthy three year old son,1
and you shouldnt be shamed for it!,0
numb sad alone angry sleepless anxious jealousmostly alone,0
i am so very sick and so weak it is really hard to stay focused these meds make me feel horrible i cant eat i cant sleep i need my mommy ,0
oh hunny i dont self harm but im teetering between homicide or suicide and i dont completely understand what is the pain killer but darlin i understand the search for something to take away the suffering and it in my case never stops even when i do my thing to numb or subdue the hurt for awhile but its there justso i will pray god to take that away from you and give you strength to stop i am afraid one day im gonna go to far and i actually pray for him to take me home i would say try getting angry (yep thats right) get mad at the evil spirit that is doing this to you thru you when you feel it coming let it out of your mouth your feelings and speak to that bad thing and tell it how pissed off you are and how you are a beautiful child of god and your body belongs to him and say this "i rebuke you you weak and defeated enemy you have no power here the holy blood of jesus christ gives me authority to cast you unholy spirit into the void "i say speak becauseeverything in this world was created with a word and the power of life and death there dwell the tongue is the most powerful thing god loves you and god bless you,0
i no the feeling its horrible,0
except i havent ive never one a battle or faced a fear all ive done is wether them is to hold on until they give up and give me a few days of rest so they come back my suffering will be fresh again,0
hey,0
well im so glad u found it that easy and u done that i am not one of those people unfortunately there is no way i can work a job at this moment in time and i havent for a number of years that doesnt mean im not a big girl i also am a mother to 6 children i feel a failure as a mother every day of my life because my illness impacts so hugely on family life i still cannot get up and go to work despite having my kids its a struggle for me to just get up to feed them some days i have bipolar borderline personality disorder chronic anxiety and ptsd  its a living hell,0
need to be honest and ask for help as that is the way to recovery believe me i know whats like to be in the dark and confused and in constant pain please be honest with your providers there is a light at the end of the tunnel,1
i have bpd and they tried soo many antidepressants etc before they found 1 that helped! i am currently on paxil along with adder rallamictal lithium abilify which is a godsend and ativan and baclofen for anxiety,1
thats the problem with addicts  everything is about them  they take and they take and they take  then they write these bullshit letters as part of their 12 steps to apologize for what theyve done - let me tell you something  thats for their benefit  not ours ! we get plunged into this guilt trip bullshit like we are just supposed to forgive them cause " their sorry " - you wanna make amends ? how about replacing all the property you destroyed ! pay me back the money you owe me  so if your going to send me some bullshit letter that makes you feel better put a check in and maybe i will believe you,1
i want to agree with everyone that her self harm is not your fault not now and not ever having said that maybe the two of you can talk about the stressful things that make her feel the need to cut are there things you can work on together? even if they are small it can make a world of difference knowing that you are working together as a team to conquer a common enemy for example i have chronic pain and depression and my husband and we make sure that we both say we are mad at the pain and the depression not mad at me my pain and depression are part of me but they are not my whole self banding together has made us stronger because fighting these demons alone is exhausting i would also strongly encourage you to find a couples counselor even if you can only afford a few sessions if you are a religious person you could also see if your place of worship offers reduced/free counseling try checking out namiorg and find support groups in your area - you should not have to fight alone i hope you can find the strength you need to find your own healing and to support your partner in theirs,0
oh my gosh the guilt??? whenever i masturbate i get this guilty feeling in my gut like a depressive heaviness comes over me i cant stand that!!! why does this hapoen???,0
i have literally been on every single "mood stabilizer" on the market i gained weight with all of them some more than others and it is not just serotonin and appetite! they mess up your metabolism! so even if you eat healthy and limit calorie intake it will still make you gain weight they are right every med has a different effect on different people some people even claim to have lost weight but i agree weight gain is definitely not insignificant!! it is a huge thing and it affects your mood your depression your anxiety and mostly your self worth!! (and really self worth is a part of all the others) ps i gained a ton of weight on risperadal!,1
you can only live in the momenttry not to think about next time instead focus on the moment you are in right nowthey say one day at a time but the truth is its one moment at a timethunk about your babies and know they need youthey will always need you i cry on my dogs shoulder all too oftenand i also fear calling any hot lines because like you what would i sayi kept it all inside for fear of losing my children if anyone found outbut recently i confided in the last person i thought i would get support from and itd a slow process but a huge release ive always feared being judged as ive had a pretty good life yet ive always been suicidal since i was 8 or 9i dont know why just have beenand not knowing is ok tooojust find a person you can trust and open up to themor even post like you did here thats why we are hereto help others not judge! i am thankful you are here and that you had the courage to speak outits nice knowing youre not alone ♡,0
yes you need to find a compassionate understanding person (there are those out there) my boyfriend of 8 year still doesnt get all the mood swings but is understanding enough to want to help dont be afraid of having kids too i have two beautiful teen girls and they havent exhibited any signs of bipolar disorder and if they do i will be here to help them with it also dont view yourself as broken i tend to think of myself as just different and with a deficiency (i tend to think of my pills as a vitamin for the brain) but if you feel you are lovable and worth it then you will attract someone,1
a good dr will only prescribe benzodiazepines as a last resort and only for short periods of time due to their addictive nature most antidepressants are also good for anxiety in long term busperine is also less additive and good for longterm management of anxiety beta blockers can help with physical symptoms drugs like valium ativan should be used sparingly,1
so true told doctors medication isnt working well it helps with the low lows but thats all i feel so depressed and cant shake it,1
people are self centers manny dont realise what they have done even i could have hurt some one the problem is i dont know i would like to think i havent but if some one told me i have i would be live then you never know what action can really hurt some one eals and i honestly be live we are all guilty of this in one way or another maybe not intentional,0
i have a horror story about that medicine a friends brother had a very tragic reaction to it,0
im so glad that you came through your surgery it must have been a very traumatic time for you i also wish your health issues were better for you since your surgery im sorry i cannot offer you any personal experience with cymbalta as ive never taken it if you have trust in your doctor though & he/she feels it will help you maybe you should give it a try? i guess that unless you try it you wont know any different right? can i please ask you a question though? do you feel that your hysterectomy has directly affected your anxiety & depression or do you feel your ongoing health issues are more to blame? i ask this as i cannot take the contraceptive pill to stop my periods & because the hormones produced during directly affect my bipolar in the worst way my doctors & i are now looking into other avenues to stop my periods or lessen their impact these include going onto hrt taking oestrogen during periods or having a total hysterectomy including ovaries removed which as you would be aware also involves hrt i have no idea which method will work but i do know that something has to be done as that time of month is without doubt my absolute most dangerous period (i am most likely to self harm or suffer such debilitating depression etc that i have very real suicidal idealisations & have attempted in the past as a result) any advice or information you can give me about your experience would be very much appreciated i have an appointment next week to find out what the best plan of action my gp & psych have come up with as they planned to speak about this before the appointment i have a close friend who has suffered anxiety for many years but after she was forced (for other medical reasons) to have a hysterectomy she has found that the severity of her anxiety symptoms have lessened significantly compared to before the surgery as you could imagine im very anxious & confused as to what to do,1
sending hugs i hope you get through this tough time and find your reason to live on i suffer from depression and anxiety along with other health problems so i know how hard things can get try to find something positive and focus on that please dont think that death is the only way out because it isnt!! you are worth more than that!!,0
in my personal opinion if your anxiety is mild enough that taking a benadryl would calm you down then its perfect for you,1
thank you for sharing about your struggles im sorry you lost someone so dear to you i was on epival 1000mg for a long time it helped stabilize my mood but i found it left me feeling depressed a lot i found that i needed an anti-depressant as well everyone is different and it can take a lot of time and trying diff medication combos its really hard to stay patient and hopeful while going thru it talk with your doctor- be open and honest about what youre dealing withabove all dont give up no matter what- you can treat this and find your groove all the best!,1
all i want is to be held tight lots of love and affection and to be reassured that the one person i need the most is there even if i try and push away i need them to pull me closer its fucked up when i act like i dont need them or want them when i really do - more then ever! worst thing to do is to leave them alone or go in a mood coz theyre being "ignorant or awkward by ignoring you" sometimes we want to talk and communicate but just cant as the words wont come out its horrible especially when asked "whats wrong" and we really dont know in my experience if someone trys to shut u out and push u away then pull them in closer tight affectionate hugs and kisses and just talk to them about anything and everything they may not respond for a while but they are listening and its taking their mind away from how they are feeling and pulling then back into the real word,0
al the electronic means of controlling youre anxiety but i have found a way that would help immediately mind you im bpd social and generalized anxiety ptsd and finally voices in my head anyway ive learned to find 5 things in a room and describe the details maybe theres something that you can realistically touch or just 5 colors and the details i have severe anger problems and this method has really helped,1
i also suffer from depression and anxiety from the early years of my child hood i get it i understand so you can always message me if you want to talk im only an inbox away,0
no you arent alone how about scheduling a lay around do nothing day? once it even twice a week rest take a break from the endless self battles and let the dishes sit no tidying up not even getting dressed on other days when you just hate everything tell yourself "i will take care of stuff today because thursday i can blow it all off no guilt" we gotta learn how to actually rest rather than crumple under the pressure we put on ourselves,0
karen yes you go to bed you cant sleep because your brain just doesnt stop weird thoughts etc it is the lack of seratonan it is an easy fix seraquil/ quetia replaces the seratonin in your brain as i have become older more stressed im taking 2x100 mg a night years ago when you get what i call the heeby jeebies in the morning (anxious shaking sweating) i used to take a tab then to calm myself i cant understand why you havent been prescribed the correct medication to address this alsosunshine helps winter is the worst time for depressants seasonal change & anniversaries of previous triggers will also determine your state of mind,1
i take 20 mg trintellix daily but dont have bipolar i have ptsd anxiety and depression,1
i m there now but starting fresh is going to be the hard part for me my fiancé left me on friday we been together for 16 years cant get her out of my head my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression is very high right now dont know what to do ,1
this is quite simple let me put it this way what do most people fear the most? the answer is - their brain shutting down and forced to be dependent they fear what they dont understand i will never understand the stigma the brain should be the most focused on- it is vital to running your body are you people with me?,0
yes we do have to get together im a sorry was trying to write about my status but couldnt shaking real n bad,0
i always feel like its more of a hassle to go to the drs and try to find the right meds i was diagnosed when i was 15 but i refused to do anything about it im 26 now and my current dr i have only told her about my anxiety and major depression most days i can be ok but others i dont get out of bed i have two young kids and it drives me insane that i dont have the energy or care to get up and do something i can manage to make sure there fed and clean but sometimes thats the best it gets i dont work right now so it not like i have places to be mental illness/addiction runs in my family ive lost 5 family members in the last 3 years to overdosingi have also had traumatic experiences while i was a child and now as a adult i dont have a support system so its hard and im scared to keep trying do the right med i know it would make a difference if i actually told my dr im bipolar and was re-evaluated now that im older and its worse but im to scared i guess,0
your guy is a control freak and using what is known as projection techniques making you feel everything is your fault he is incapable of thinking of you as he is a narcissist and wants the world to revolve around him you need someone who will support you when youre low and share the bad times as well as the good and not lay the blame at your feet   you are worth more than he is but you need to show him this   tell him to take a hike and come back when he appreciates what your feeling what depression and anxiety is and how low it makes you feel once he has had a taste of you not caring about him and concentrating on yourself it may teach him a serious life lesson if not your better off on your own   dont allow yourself your feelings or emotions be manipulated by a fool that doesnt support you!   good luck ,0
my driving phobia started in july 2006 on a trip between jackson ms and memphis ideas: either claustrophobia or agoraphobia or both dr had me try rolling my windows down while driving the further away the destination or the longer the trip or the more stops i have to make intensifies the anxiety over the past three years it has gotten to where i cant leave the house without having some sort of anxiety or a full-blown panic attack i have reached my destination before and had to leave because everything started going black and i started hyperventilating and felt like i would pass out,1
please call your dr asap please this has to be a horrible experience my best wishes to you,0
i know for myself i thought i was not worthy of people or having nice things in my life because im bi polar so i would allow abusive behavior from others im 52 now and have lived with the diagnosis for almost 10 years but i defiantly can tell you  you deserve better look for another job first then march in to that mans office and tell him to shove it up his --- !! you are beautiful with and without scares!! everyone has scares but just not everyones are seen please reach out to someone and ask for help it does not have to be friends or family just someone im proud of you for reaching out to us i will pray for you!!!,0
trying to differentiate between dream v reality distressing,1
i am rapid cycle bipolar 1 and have been diagnosed in 2008 yes it has been a rollercoaster but it is a manageable illness if that gives you hope i continue to struggle when i take my meds i resent it but i know that i need to in order to remain stable and live a balanced life you can either choose to be healthy or remain a victim to your moods which trust me is not fun and dangerous take that first step and find a doctor you are comfortable with and talk to a therapist about your feelings with this new diagnosis you will be fine and that is the great news good luck and feel free to message me with any questions or concerns,1
my goal is to one day not need so much medicine my doctor has told me she has no other meds ive tried them all i dont trust all in meds ive decided when i get the time to go back to yoga i obviously have anxiety from all the years of abuse from child good until an early adult,1

type 1 and med free for over a year - but i worked hard on recognising signs symptoms and triggers and still use some medication as needed to calm anxiety/mania if needed,1
i tried it and i dont want to scare you or assume youre like me but i got pregnant a few years ago i have bipolar ii and generalized anxiety disorder there are some meds you can take when youre pregnant but its not the same and in my opinion may not be healthy for a baby i couldnt handle the pregnancy approved meds they did nothing for me i became so suicidal that i knew i might kill myself even pregnant ill be brutally honest i ended up getting an abortion ill never get pregnant again it wasnt safe for me or the baby im not judging what you feel is right thats just my story and how hard that was on me on every level,1
it sent me into a dark mania and i was suicidal terrifying time,0
so proud of you for being so strong last night i have been where you are i was not so strong as you but i survived the guilt still haunts me today take it one day at a time the feeling will get better i promise,0
sometimes not even a doctor can help being a bipolar manic depressive that i am i was prescribed 3 antidepressants all at one time they didnt seem to help so stopped taking them but as for me i maintain my illness through faith of my higher power & surround myself w/positive environment maybe being honest with urself what causes ur depression & anxiety it could very well be ur family causing the depression and anxiety u knw things like trying to live their expectations of u and feeling accepted by those that say that they love u keep in mind that i am not a doctor or a therapist but i do know this i had to cut ties w/my family in order to start living a happier life please know that i am not trying to tell u how or what to do with ur life im just telling u what worked with me i hope this will give u a little encouragement to start feeling better about urself!,0
when im anxious its because i am bipolar when im depressed its because i am bipolar i have zero control over either,0
i allways over think n analyze everything too death im on six different medications n none of them help this problem for me personally i shut my mind off by smoking weed it helps with my mind n anxiety,1
personally for low mood and anxiety id want to be on fluoxetine (prozac),0
truvision works belinda piketru try ths stuff message this girl the stuff is amazing i dont really have to worry about anti depressant as much !,1
mine hide pretty well i can be freaking out unable to breathe and still function still keep working im shaking unable to breathe eyes dilated feeling like i need to run run run im terrified of something i cant consciously see but i keep working i keep moving i cant sit and break down sometimes i can separate myself and work on breathing but usually i cant my zoloft helps control those better so i havent been slammed with these attacks in a while,0
honestly talk to your counselor if you dont have one get one there are low income clinics that go on a sliding scale when i was going it was completely free because i have literally no income otherwise look into ways to change your thought process when my thoughts turn dark like that (which is often) i yell in my head stop and picture a giant stop sign i then go and do something physical either coloring working with plants or working with the dogs if these things are not helping i will ask my personal service dog to come and task help me avoid caffeine if you can it can actually make anxiety and paranoid thoughts worse take a warm/hot shower do grounding techniques you can google this and go to images and find lists of things to do heres a cute picture of my girl to hopefully make you smile a bit if you need to talk my inbox is always open im not very good at carrying a conversation but i will always be willing to let you vent about things bothering you,0
i am bipolar 2 an also a spring depressive when i say depression everyone says "oh it must be so hard all winter i just hate it tough to spend every winter so down you must have s a d me: not at all i love winter! they never understand i always feel best in october get jobs in november and lose them by may that was before meds but i still struggle every march-april to prevent a full episode,0
anyone who has been living with mental health disorders are very familiar with the restless insomnia and manic episodes that can take place even if you are on medication therapy and seeing a mental health professional i have been in this boat many times and have found that deep breathing exercises having a cup of tea or joining an 24 hr online support group to chat with people who really understand what you are going through can really help if you are really in crisis or think about harming yourself however you should call your local community outreach or crisis hotline immediately stay strong and just take it one day at a time god bless you ,0
the depressive state of bipolar 2 can last for days or longer that is dangerous for the person affected because they are definitely at risk for suicide :(,0
so true so very true anxiety really does suck being made fun of it sucks note,1
bahaha! how can you love someone you havent met yet? i mean you can love the idea of it but until you hold that baby in your arms and it smiles its little gas smile at you have no idea your stressed and that is normal for a soon to be dad and it is more than likely effecting you you should let your doc know what is going on you should also give yourself a break lay down with your lady and tell her you love her and rub her feet i repeat rub them feet lol get some coco butter and rub her belly (showing or not) show her you care that way and shrugg off other opinions stress seems to be your problem and worring over rather other people think you are feeling the right way about it will only make it worse just my humble opinion,0
i have been bipolar since i was 6 years old i know about misdiagnosis! 49 years 45 of those years self medicating with alcohol and numerous drugs started at 12 years old ive been medicated for 8 years now ive been on 10 different anti depressants 5 mood stabilizers librium zanax clonaxapam chantix abilify well thats all i remember off the top of my head still havent found a cocktail that works i struggle everyday just to get out of bed and have for 12 years everyone i read about a mental illness that im not familiar with i have my provider test me for it paranoia will destroy ya someone in crisis asked a question and i gave an honest answer and sound advice you kinda left that part out just sayin! 4 1/2 years ago i started to design a support group specifically for women with mental disorders once i got it all put together i presented it my psych provider she thought it was awesome 3 years ago she started this group nobody would even look up let alone talk they are now thriving happy enjoying life some for the first time i have been working on the next step for a year now with the same psych provider i am so excited to get the next stage implemented it brings the greatest joy to my heart that my inspirations have made such a positive impact for 6 survivors 6 out of 6 ,0
i have bipolar 1 and i was put on 600 mg of lithium and 3 mg of risperidone i recently got that decreased to 1 mg though i havent been manic is over a year and i feel mostly good! my dad passed away from lung cancer last august and im struggling to find a job so im depressed and anxious about that but thats understandable,0
i struggled with this concern as well i didnt want something that was going to throw off the balance of my meds once a month i talked in depth with my doctor about it as we agreed on the iud (mirena) it has the least amount of hormones with the best success rate for what i was specifically looking for i have had three now (one after each child and then got it replaced when the 5 yrs was up) i have had very little issue with it best of luck my friend,0
i almost forgot it was mothers day personally i have no relationship with my own mother and my youngest son is entering his last week of his freshman year of high school my horse gashed his forehead open my a&p class started i had served on a major criminal case jury the week before last my oldest totally took over everything for me while i was stuck at a courtroom for 12+ hours a day so we all forgot until my dad reminded me saturday mothers day isnt a big deal to me my kids appreciate me every day of the year they have been known to give me fathers day cards too in the past because i am a single mom and play both rolls i dont hold one thoughtless moment against them much they are teenagers teenagers are notoriously selfish (its just how their brains are) doesnt mean she doesnt love you or appreciate you yes your mom could have done something but she didnt and why get upset about what could of would of should of? its really not worth the energy my ex never did crap for me on my birthday mothers day any holidays and i spent a lot of time being miserable and letting him ruin it we run into problems when we expect people to treat us the same way we treat them rather than accepting that people do the best that they can do even when its far from acceptable to us ive worked hard to learn how to not rely on others for my happiness,0
hi ally so sorry for your dilemma it mustve been hard dealing with it i know its not easy anxiety involves feelings of uneasiness nervousness or worry because we live in an uncertain world bouts of anxiety can overtake any of us however please dont give up ❤️ id like to share this with you that might be of help; as it already did many others please take care ❤️ ,1
buspar (or busperin) is a non-addictive alternative to more traditional meds like valium or klonopin ive been on it off and on for a couple of years its been very effective in treating my gad but it stops working if you take it very consecutively its not an antidepressant it was made specifically for people with anxiety disorders it shouldnt cause mania or exacerbate it in any way at most you will feel a little dizzy if this occurs then take a half of one instead of a whole one,1
people always tell me to volunteer guess what i dont want to bug off i have some things i want to do like write a book about my bipolar past 30 yrs of alcohol & crack addiction and my life being a born again christian but i dont know how to start and some other things but im stuck on my kitchen chair playing on my phone avoiding housework every day as it is,0
people dont see when we are struggling so very hard to keep our disorder from spilling out and becoming obvious this is when they think we can "just get over it" or that it isnt a "real" disorder,0
i struggle with it drives me insane :(,0
i would suggest family counseling so she can understand from a professional that its a real illness and not just some attention seeking behavior trust me if we could control it we sure as hell would meds can helpsome dont but it takes more than getting outside the best advice is focus on getting better and not how people;even family perceive your disorder you can only do what you can each day put one foot in front of the other and take a step forward no matter how small remember you are not alone there are many of us who suffer in silence and shame im learning to become okay with being myself ((hugs)),0
amberlea amberlyn you have some good wisdom i too have survived suicide unlike my brother and now feel the world needs all of us who struggle daily to live our pain allows us to understand others who feel hopeless the fight is worth the reward hang in there there is a great man in your future one who will idetify with your struggles and understand your pain i hope you keep fightingyou are in my thoughts and prayers you are important to me please post and let us know how your doing from time to time,0
im a mom of three with differing diagnoses 1 no and1 anxiety disorder and 1 with borderline personality i love all 3 i see their struggles i would not trade my time with them for anything,0
i was on zoloft all of the dosage and it just made me worst the side effects of it is horrible i ended up in the hospital cause of the bad thoughts and before i could start a new medication i had to let zoloft out of my system so the withdrawal was horrible as well i was so sick i couldnt move cause of the withdrawal i dont recommend zoloft to noone i dont like it,0
its really hard and u r very brave i have to struggle everyday to get out of a house oh sweet i lot because of my anxieties so i do feel sorry for you just keep on battling all the best to you,0
oh sweetheart i totally feel like i know how you feel and bless you for your bravery to open up and share as you just did you are a very brave and strong woman because you had the guts to do that and not hide away i know about the hole once youve been it youre always scared of it especially because youve got responsibilities and cant afford to go back because of them its always terrifying because they dont mean to cause stress but they do and some days youre just holding on for dear life to get through and avoid the hole i guess id say if you can find some relief some help so you can take quality time out for yourself to catch your breath and feel refreshed thats very important for you you need real breaks and time for you and your mental well-being you also need to make sure youre getting lots of good quality sleep my friend rest is so important to staving off depression keep in touch!,0
stop beating urself up needing meds does not mean u r weak and id certainly nothing to be ashamed of,1
yeah know the feeling about every three days or maybe four my energy zaps to a very low point which in turn makes me really miserable where i do almost nothing depending on who you talk to will depend on the answers for me i monitor the activity i do and know i have to pace myself or hit a low point that can last for a few days (fibro sufferer) i started taking vitamin d3 again and some coq10 it helps to give the immune system a little boost which in turn boosts the ability to cope slightly better i would suggest using something like the fibromapp app ideal for monitoring and you can customise it pacing yourself during the up days may also help with energy on the low days if youre having issues sleeping whether it be physical or mental pain just chill out if you can the more you fight it the worse it becomes the energy cycle has many factors lastly have a look into yoga stretching and breathing techniques the latter is very important to how we heal internally plenty of yt vids around for free the stretching is only stretching no weights or press ups etc just simple stretching techniques along with the breathing is a good energy maker throw in some relaxing music quietness and hopefully 10 20 30 minutes of this will help a little or a lot,0
although its difficult for you with all the life stressors all at once you have to believe that everything changes  it will pass as it has before stay strong hope a little peace comes your way soon xx,0
being scared is totally ok to be feeling even though being in a psch ward is hard you know you are going to be safe being out on your own brings a full list of emotions that you need to try and manage take it hour by hour and when you get through each hour you are coping and achieving be kind to yourself take baby steps try and get help and support from those you can trust when you need it and keep telling yourself "i can do this" we are all so brave to be fighting our battles everyday we have to believe we can do this sending hugs xx,1
afraid thats mental illness for you a right sod!!,1
is it really necessary to be rude to someone obviously struggling? does that make you feel better about yourself?,0
xanax is best for me as i have anxiety and panic attacks i need something fast acting i dont experience general anxiety all day it usually comes and goes i drive work craft cook etc etc with no problem ive been off it for wks and no withdrawals but everyone is different mindfulness can help with anxious thoughts good luck hope you find the best med for you,1

i dread these feelings that never returning back from that dark nightmare ,0
thank you brenton gandy i dont ever want to be back where i was before my diagnosis when my doctor told me i have depression and anxiety i got with my family ( kids and husband ) to figure out an action plan  when my son was diagnosed a year ago with bipolar and syncophenia we put in an action plan for him as well  he is almost 22 ,1
: we had two bags of grass seventy-five pellets of mescaline five sheets of high-powered blotter acid a saltshaker half-full of cocaine and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers downers screamers laughers also a quart of tequila a quart of rum a case of beer a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the ether there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge and i knew wed get into that rotten stuff pretty soon : lets give the boy a lift : what? no we cant stop here this is bat country!!!,0
i dont know what the answer for you is at this point in your life but i know that meds can help a lot with anxiety the problem is we need a certain amount of anxiety to spur us onwardbut too much anxiety can make your job a whole lot harder that stress sure can wear you out it can damage your body and mind pray is what i do i used to pray before work i used to say to god "i know that nothing is going to happen today that you and i cant handle together" some people wont believe this but god tells me to trust him prayer helps us with wisdom we can ask for strength and for wisdom and power to get through the anxiety i have a bible verse for you 2 timothy 6 "wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands 7 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power and of love and of a sound mind the gift he spoke of was prayer in the power of the holy spiritit is worth asking for it is evidence that the holy spirit dwells in a believer in christ it gives power spiritually to live a christian life and to have faith ask god for all these things go to a full gospel church maybe you wont like me talking about faith but god can heal us if we trust him it can take time medication is something to pray about too if you can attend a church or ministry where people pray for one another to get free of spiritual illness once a woman prayed for me when i was really depressed and god touched me and totally lifted my depression and i had a great peace some people have the gift of praying for people and the people get healed,0
first ask your self the question what is important to you have you always felt like this with your job is this a new thing is some outsides source contributing to your stress new relationship family drama do you like this challenging job? the best thing to do in a stressful situation is vent get it all out of your mind if there someone close to you to talk about this thing i see a therapist so sometimes venting helps i go into that room with a variety of thing on my mind and come out calmer i dont have a solution right away but i am just less stressed exercise helps a lot even if it running for a short distance bipolar or not we all experienced high stress at work just bc you have bipolar does not mean your forced to be in a situation you should not want to be taking days off might give you an idea on how you will feel if you did not have this job i text my self in a stressing situation so i know what was my triggers bc we easily forget what upset is then i go over it with my therapist changes when we have a mental condition can be more difficult to deal with as anxiety goes up depression episode might emerge its ok to be stress dont be hard on your self  i take medication so it keeps me balance sleep on your decisions you might feel differently the next day  we are only human and sometimes we are self are our worst enemies dont look for perfection it does not exist one day at a time  we tend to think of tones of fake senecrious that are more like not to happen  i wish you the best and i sure you will make the right decisions for yours self bc you know your self best,0
dont stop ur meds you will go into a scary tail spin i know because ive done it b4 best wishes,0
you definitely need some different meds and some stronger doses to stop the monkey gym thats going on inside your head driving you to chaos the noise in your head needs to be turned way down and medicine can do that i suggest slow release lithium and an atypical anti psychotic like ziprasidone another great mood stabilizer is zonisamide which has an active element for anxiety zoloft taken in the morning at a low dose with this combination is like a good sprinkle of salt for depression too much and it can cause depression or mania but 25mg is good finally counseling!,1
gail deshong it felt like a weird panic attack all the time nothing visible but inside it felt horrible it got to the point that i couldnt function because it was so distracting and brought me to psychosis,0
this is your damaged mind saying this not the true you you want to live life and see your children grow but the illness makes it difficult try not to feel guilty or have shame over what your illness is doing to you just keep living life and seek help if you can surround yourself with a support network and believe that one day you will pull through this dark cloud,0
im on xanax xr 2mg prior to that i took klono but didnt help me i was very afraid to start either medication but glad i finally gave the xr a try finally able to have relief from anxiety and panic attacks and am finally getting out ive tried many antidepressants but do not respond to them i dont want to be on xanax forever but for now its helping they are addicting and im sure the withdrawals are hell but what is one to do ? cant live your life in hell either everyone is different talk to your doctor,1
photographic memory is completely gone ive never felt so dumb in my life i also have many of those physical ailments more meds on top of bipolar meds currently adding high blood pressure to the list more doctors more meds,1
i have the same problem in the morning i gag and feel sick to my stomach i wish i knew why i mean is this part of anxiety?,0
sending you lots of love and positive energy everyday is a struggle for me im glad someone was looking over you and hope you find the care youre needing right now ❤,0
yeah zeprexa is strong definitely but i take my meds at night and it stabilizes me through out the day along with my anxiety disorder i take clonazepam,1
this could not be more true!!! i hate having anxiety and being in a constant battle with my brain in every choice i make!!! but i am focusing on controlling it and learning my triggers along with handling with depression and bipolar disorder! i dont ask for a pity party cause i am fine!!! i have an awesome support system w beautiful healthy little girls and a husband who loves me despite the struggles he faces learning to cope with my anxiety/depression/bipolar disorder and hes learning a lot about symptoms and understanding what each thing does to me and how it affects my daily life! he is my rock and i couldnt be more thankful for him standing by me through it all!!!! hes the real mvp!!!,1
many of us can relate to your hurt frustration and fear very few of my family/friends know about my depression i think its better that way because they dont understand cant expect them to im not looking for sympathy and often thats what happens or like many say family/friends look at you different and think its just a "phase or situation" we have to take one minute at a time with this cut out toxic people and situations in your life even if it means "being alone" i find its easier that way god is my strength,0
little shop of horrors or pulp fiction its a toss up lol,0
propranolol is a beta blocker that is used for heart arrhythmia but is also use for anxiety it can also lower bp but very slightly,1
since you have not invested a lifetime as i have and your children and you equally agree that this is relationship on a downward spiral i would back out without any further attachments sounds like he has gotten help and its his decision to continue it is your own decision to take care of you the best you can guilt free you have to or you yourself will end up not being able to function continued treatment and support is the key though,1
suicidal ideation isnt actually a diagnosis it just means you have suicidal thoughts which is common with ptsd and bipolar disorder cognitive behavioral therapy has shown to be very successful in helping with that if you havent tried it theres a book by david burns called feeling good: the new mood therapy that i love that was our curriculum when i was in the hospital its also very effective with depression and anxiety :),1
this sucks writing this because i have bipolar type 2 as well as ptsd but this mentality is making us sicker i say this because if we hole up and isolate stay indoors and shut out the lights were only feeding our depression what it wants its impossible to get better even in the slightest bit if we play this card is it hard to get out of bed for me? yes do i spend soo much time in my head that i come up with the most irrational thoughts? yup but i try to do as much as i can in a day even if im choking back tears and wanting to just disappear all of us have that one personsome many more than one that depends on us breathing that alone makes us special we are way too hard on ourselves at times and no one might understand our issues but someone out there loves us for the messes we are unconditionally and thats beautiful,0
my personal opinion is that this chart gives a poor description of both it uses professional terms that a lot of people dont know the meaning or understand i also find it interesting that under bipolar it says episode of mania (term a lot of people dont know or understand) associated with euphoria (again - whats that?) and depression and under bpd it says mood (inaccurate information - bpd is not a mood disorder its a personality disorder) changes including irritability sadness feelings of emptiness and anxiety those are all symptoms of depression and seen in mania and where are they measuring if its a personality problem situational mood or something else bpd is most problems due to relationships and how one views the world which this chart says nothing this chart has too many wholes in leaving one still confused i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety more than 10 years ago it was very clear i was manic and depressed and anxious most of the time but continued to have other problems that were untreated and not symptoms of bipolar or anxiety last summer when i went to the hospital was finally diagnosed with bpd it didnt take away the other diagnosis i had was a third disorder its sad that it took so long and of all people wasnt even a dr to find the problem nurse mentioned it before i ever saw the dr based on our interactions and after spending hours with the dr talking about what was going on and what had happened for years dr confirmed and not to mention bipolar is treatable with a combination of medication and counseling techniques bpd is only treatable with therapy and from what ive been told only thing that works is dialectic behavior therapy,1
i know the struggle take care and please try to find people to surround yourself that are understanding compassionate and supportive family relations are important but if they are unable to be there for you you may need to distance yourself to find what you need to be well take care,1
marjorie is right no amount of advice from us will make any difference if u feel like that call your crisis team dont risk it,0
i went on rexulti literally a week after it got fda approval it worked soo great!! i felt so much better! i was nervous to try it after researching it but it really worked for me!!  unfortunately it had a less motivating effect on my metabolism and i gained a ton of weight super fast! ended up stopping it in my 3rd month because of the weight gain!,1
lithium just makes you fact serequol makes you like a zombie abiify have to watch i took higher doses and became confused lamictal seems to be what there pushing these days,0
no you should definitely not be started on alprazolam straight of the bat! xanax either! my goodness these are serious medications unless your doctor is prescribing them in minute amounts id be very cautious even 1mg of either of these drugs could be way too much for you to begin with & ive been on both of these at different stages the best of the two for anxiety was alprazolam for me,1
i cannot recommend mindfulness enough for anxiety it takes practice and may not be a short term fix if you are already anxious but when you have a moment where you can focus do some research on it it has been a god send for me i also keep a journal of my moods it gives me some insight how my moods are and if they are starting to get out of control trying to do things that give you some control over an illness that tries to take so much is a really big help if you can see triggers or patterns you said summer had been a trigger pattern then you might be able to do something different to try and help the situation all the best,1
i am in the belief he has took to strong words because he is worried and doesnt know how to express feeling of losing you too the demons that medication keeping away hopes and prayers with you,1
hi sweetheart im sorry you are going through such trauma at a young age i hope you have received rape counseling and ptsd counseling and therapy it sounds like you are suffering terribly at your age i wouldnt want to gain weight either any age really but because you are so young your body is still changing so you might not have such a bad problem i dont know because the meds im on dont effect me like that im being treated for bipolar major depression and anxiety im also a recovering alcoholic and prescription drug abuser i know it seems impossible to even think you will get better but you will if you really want to but you have to do some of the work there are antidepressants that actually suppress the appetite prozac wellbutrin have that effect you might ask your doctor about those so remember we need more strong young people like you in the world go to university you will love it i bet they have counseling for everything youve been through and support groups good luck at school!,0
please go see an intake coordinator for an evaluation they want to help you feel safe get rest so you can think straightet get your meds adjusted and perhaps to a more appropriate counselor different modsalitiesof therapy like meds work for different people please call now if you cant get a ride someone will help you please trust me i am multidiagnosed with bpd gad mdd and a bunch of other alphabet soup i function on different levels thru out my life ive been on both sides of that psych hospitaldoor been a patient been a charge nurse we care if in doubt please get evaluated i want to hear back from you8,0

i know its hard because suicide is different for everyone i used to read this post whenever i felt like i wanted to end it everyone is different and i found that this helped me out as well as seeking professional help i am one of seven and when i was going through my darkest days i always thought of my little brother who would have been 6 at the time i understand that for some people it is impossible to think of anything thing else but this what helped me i also wrote a story for those closest to me which explained what i was going through which also helped me so anyway this is the post i read; wanna kill yourself? trust me ive been there before & im here for every single one of you!! imagine this you come home from school one day you’ve had yet another horrible day you’re just ready to give up so you go to your room close the door and take out that suicide note you’ve written and rewritten over and over and over you take out those razor blades and cut for the very last time you grab that bottle of pills and take them all laying down holding the letter to your chest you close your eyes for the very last time a few hours later your little brother knocks on your door to come tell you dinners ready you don’t answer so he walks in all he sees is you laying on your bed so he thinks you’re asleep he tells your mom this your mom goes to your room to wake you up she notices something is odd she grabs the paper in your hand and reads it sobbing she tries to wake you up she’s screaming your name your brother so confused runs to go tell dad that “mommy is crying and sissy won’t wake up” your dad runs to your room he looks at your mom crying holding the letter to her chest sitting next to your lifeless body it hits him what’s going on and he screams he screams and throws something at the wall and then falling to his knees he starts to cry your mom crawls over to him and they sit there holding each other crying the next day at school there’s an announcement the principal tells everyone about your suicide it takes a few seconds for it to sink in and once it does everyone goes silent everyone blames themselves your teachers think they were too hard on you those mean popular girls they think of all the things they’ve said to you that boy that used to tease you and call you names he can’t help but hate himself for never telling you how beautiful you really are your ex boyfriend the one that you told everything to that broke up with you he can’t handle it he breaks down and starts crying and runs out of the school your friends? they’re sobbing too wondering how they could never see that anything was wrong wishing they could have helped you before it was too late and your best friend? she’s in shock she can’t believe it she knew what you were going through but she never thought it would get that bad… bad enough for you to end it she can’t cry she can’t feel anything she stands up walks out of the classroom and just sinks to the floor shaking screaming but no tears coming out it’s a few days later at your funeral the whole town came everyone knew you that girl with the bright smile and bubbly personality the one that was always there for them the shoulder to cry on lots of people talk about all the good memories they had with you there were a lot everyone’s crying your little brother still doesn’t know you killed yourself he’s too young your parents just said you died it hurts him a lot you were his big sister you were supposed to always be there for him your best friend she stays strong through the entire service but as soon as they start lowering your casket into the ground she just loses it she cries and cries and doesn’t stop for days it’s two years later your teachers all quit their job those mean girls have eating disorders now that boy that used to tease you cuts himself your ex boyfriend doesn’t know how to love anymore and just sleeps around with girls your friends all go into depression your best friend? she tried to kill herself she didn’t succeed like you did but she tried…your brother? he finally found out the truth about your death he self harms he cries at night he does exactly what you did for years leading up to your suicide your parents? their marriage fell apart your dad became a workaholic to distract himself from your death your mom got diagnosed with depression and just lays in bed all day people care you may not think so but they do your choices don’t just effect you they effect everyone don’t end your life you have so much to live for things can’t get better if you give up i’m here for absolutely anyone that needs to talk no matter who you are even if we’ve never talked before i’m here for you copy and paste this as your status to show people there are people out there that carelets see who actually read all of it for anyone that feels this way could 1 friend please copy and repost (not share)? we are trying to demonstrate that someones always listening #suicideawareness 1-800-273-8255,0

i am a recovering self harmer i see it as being like an alcoholic you are never really over it first of all i strongly encourage you to seek out a crisis hotline in your area please therapy can really help for more immediate relief i used this method and it will sound weird: squeeze ice cubes they give a burning sensation which gives you that pain feeling but doesnt have a lasting injury and the actual physical force of squeezing them released tension and stress for me i hope this helps i would also draw what i wanted to cut instead of actually cutting,1
just lie down beside herhold her and tell her you understand when i shut down like thisits because the pain is overwhelming and i cant thinkmove or talk i wish my husband would understand but he just yells at me and calls me lazy thats the worst thing to do,0

nothing wrong with that at all if it feels right for you at the time go for it ive done it myself before admittedly not in bed but ive crashed out on the settee for a day i echo what bryan said be careful about making sure it doesnt take over your life i think it could end up feeding the anxiety if it becomes a regular thing but for an odd occasion nothing wrong with it in my opinion hope this helps u,0
you are obviously concerned so my suggestion is to see your dr i would also suggest keeping a mood journal listing dates and times of mood changes and how you feel at that time you can then take this journal to your dr and it can be a very effective diagnostic tool you dont always remember everything when you go to see a dr about mental health because of anxiety or poor memory in general,1
i was on lamictal and seraquel 10 years ago and they both incapacitated me to where i couldnt leave the house that lasted for a month then jumped off all my meds cause that just aint no way to live my life is a great big struggle but id rather live and screw up on a daily basis than be a walking zombie :) so nine years off all of it no regrets,0

i was on prozac when i got pregnant and came off although considered safe being on it in the 3rd trimester can cause the baby to suffer from withdrawal im struggling but hanging on also in my 3rd trimester now its a risk/benefit weighing game and its hard personally ill be doing limited breastfeeding after birth so i can get on a full spectrum of meds and treat it aggressively best of luck to you hun we mommas put up with a lot!,1
you should never be ashamed of how you feel ~ s~,0
sue i could have written your post my mother suffered from severe manic depression she was delusional she thought people on the radio were listening to her and people on tv were watching her she endured many ects and hospital stays she would walk around barefoot during the winter wearing only a thin spring coat while looking for cigarette butts left on the sidewalk it was awful i never had any friends over because i didnt want to have to explain to them why my mother was different than theirs she died at age 54 from cancer my brother was bipolar too he committed suicide in feb 2010 because he couldnt stand being in pain all the time from depression i am bipolar too but fortunately i am not suicidal i struggle with depression sometimes for weeks at a time im 58 and still trying to find the right meds to help alleviate the depression my brothers suicide has really done a number on me,0
i take lithium and seroquel i found the right med combo for me about 3 years ago but it was one of the hardest things i ever went through i got diagnosed after a very bad and long manic episode so while i was finding the right meds i was depressed everyday for months and spent a lot of time sleeping i tried a lot of different meds before i found the right ones my mom and stepdad were very supportive and let me stay with them i also went to a bipolar support/educational group once a week that was so helpful the leader taught us about bipolar and how to talk to our doctors since it can be hard in the beginning describing how you feel and knowing the doctor lingo i went off my meds recently for a few months and ended up in another manic episode and in the mental hospital but ive been back on my meds for about a month and am finally feeling back to my normal self thank goodness! i was taught that the best combination for bipolar is a mood stabilizer to keep you from going too low and an antipsychotic to keep from going into manias i also took an anti anxiety med in the beginning because i had very bad social anxiety while trying to find the right meds i hope the best for you i know how hard it is i was actually very against medications when i first got diagnosed but truly had no other option and now at this point i am so grateful for it i would hear people talk in my support group about feeling like the person that were intended to be on meds and i never thought it would be that way for me and it is i hope that is helpful and wish nothing but the best for you ❤,1
i also have ptsd and have to see the person that caused it it seriously males me want to literally kill him everyone i see him because he refuses to take responsibility for what he did i know what you are going through and just to say suck it up is plain stupidity!!!!! im not saying that my fantasizing about killing mine is the best way but it helps me very through it till i get back to my safe place if you arent in therapy you do need to get there me and my therapist are working on me not feeling that way anymore anger is part of ptsd and it is ok to feel that way fear is part of it to find a safe place in your mind sing to yourself quote scriptures pray whatever you have to do till you can get away from him,0

id be concerned that if you are high risk you are reactive to it in a different way than others are honestly im obviously not a dr but since you just started the medication its probably safer for you to stop taking it rather than staying on it until friday,1

faher van zuiden it is irrisponsponsible of you to say what you just did mainly telling this young lady things are never permanent is beyond misleading and cruel the way you are going about it psychological illnesses just dont disappear over time between coping skills and meds a normal happy life is possible and saying we all have them (anxieties and depressions) yes this is true but some of us arent the norm and catorgorizing us as such only says more that you have no idea what youre talking about when it comes down to psychological disorders now to the person asking for help one you can do some research and maybe find a support group for anxiety/depression near you and talking about it does help i have 37 years experience with this one also make sure you get on that phone and get an appointment somewhere as soon as your insurance starts you might be able to get on that phone now and make the appointment knowing you have an appointment coming up helps too are you using lavender and eucalyptus oils burning them in either a diffuser or just a simple oil burner while calmly breathing while relaxing for awhile a couple times hell as much as you can a day it helps toogood luck,1

its a real struggle i have good days and then theres those days that seem to never end i also suffer from severe anxiety so when im low im very low but horribly anxious at the same time i want to crawl out of my own skin sometimes on good days theyre awesome and i feel somewhat ok my medication is helping but as we all know theres no cure and medication can only help maintain the illness when im down and depressed i think of the good days and try my best to stay positive by reminding myself that this wont last forever take your medication it does help i know not all meds are for everyone and the process of finding the cocktail that work is agonizing because youre already on edge and arent sure how the medication will work and react to your body its a process but it helps hang in there guys i truly mean it when i say i understand we are not victims we are not crazy we are people who with patience and practice can heal and feel better,0
i know its horrible isnt it but we are stronger than people think we get up and do it where some wouldnt when they dint even have our problem remember we are strong and better than everyone else!!  x,0
dont know about cymbalta but seroquel has changed my life i love it taken my psychosis symptoms to very manageable hardly any paranoia sleep amazing and anger problems sorted right out its not ideal during day cos it does knock you out so need to slightly cut dose but worth it for the benefits also i did gain nearly 3 stone but have managed to lose it and maintain the loss,1
im struggling with this as well im still getting help for it as its nothing seems to be working cbt helps try reading or listening to music so that you can imagine something in your head then close your eyes and think of that after a while you will hopefully fall asleep - hopefully :) it doesnt work with everyone,1
i need one now so much has happened in the last month im overwhelmed,0
i am an alcoholic in recovery but still struggle with my food addition,0
to feel suicidal is part of our condition most of us at some point will consider suicide to feel this way isnt selfish or cowardly it means we need help we need to get better for our selves with out the snap out of it for your family guilt which makes the self hate a thousand times worse talk to some one hunni x,0
im not really afraid of it im more afraid of what others think of it that may sound well how it sounds to another hehe and yes that caused me little fear i just want to be loved like everyone else even you,0
the horror the horror the horror the horror,0
i say that i am not a proffessional but just gotta let that anxiety out go to a place or do it in your house in your room and take a deep breathe and then let it out as a big loud scream that will hopefully help you feel a little bit better then you have got to be strong and bring yourself to looking for friends that are willing to listen and respond to your questions i know this will be hard but it would be good to find a therapist that will actually listen to you and give you her proffesional out put sorry if i mis spelled any of my words me i would rather keep things in than go to a therapist and have them tell me some stupid excersize but like i said you look like you are really suffering,0
will be end of june before i start as im going to amsterdam that month so im going to look into what strains have high cbd/low thc and then go from there will keep the group updated though,0

being that i doubt youve been pregnant or have a medical degree i dont think your feedback is applicable to the question,0
i worry where to get a job so that i could buy those sleeping medicine stop me from getting out of the house going to places just by walking it hurts my feet if im inbed not taking my own meds my hand moves like someones waking me up and id see shadow if i get out it follows me and i could see other stuff and i could see a lot of shadows not just the one who follows you maybe becuase television news shows a lot of crimes and horors if im awake im at the bakeshop im hungry so i eat bread and one making the bread is handsome i wish i have money if i dont have meds i just get out and look for food to eat,0
i have actually been here and know exactly how you feel keep climbing those mountains i have realized by this point i simply have major limitations i dont even try to force it anymore if the idea of participating is overwhelming i simply dont do it if i forced myself to do things i dont want to i would be majorly triggered saying "no i am sorry i cant" is one of the most empowering phrases ive learned to master ive never had a friend that didnt understand it ❤️,0
that self doubt of judging whats "normal" really makes it harder on ourselves ,0
as somebody with a lot of mental problems of course i would it can be difficult sometimes and it can sometimes be stressful but i believe that if you truly love that person an illness shouldnt stop that,0
meds love them or hate them one needs them like a fish needs water or a diabetic needs insulin or blood pressure meds or anti inflammatories for arthritis so whence the hate? change that to necessity be creative i hate the packets i have two small lunchboxes one with a sticker of a little girl watering her plants (am) and the other with her in her nightie (pm) i typed a list of each lot of meds plus how many and glued it to the inside of each lid (in case family needs to know) i keep the tubs at the table where l watch tv and over the years have learned (after stopping twice) and suffering the awful outcomes that l need these little things in order not to melt into a pile of bones i know i need them during the day but especially at night to help me sleep sometimes l get into bed and just cant sleep then l realize ah ha! i forgot my evening meds so make your meds containers pretty accept that you have to take them truly this will help you wishing you much happiness and stability <3,1

i agree lori i personally found that remark uncalled for and a bit upsetting people really aught to choose their words a bit more wisely on social media particularly on a page such as this,0
a wise man once said you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quicker,1
ive tried all the write it down and burn it bullshit i hid it for years and functioned for somewhere around 10yrs or so un til something else happened in my life all that happened was a fing diagnosis of ptsd even more meds and extensive therapy and the thoughts of death on tbe daily please just go to therapy now get it out and move on with your life while your young dont end uplike me basically living in a 10x12 bedroom coming out only to exercise your dog and go to doctors appts live a good life and dont end up with social anxiety because of some asshole from the past,0

youre welcome! its a hard life to live with those illnesses and as someone who has depression and anxiety as well i know the hard fight it can be if you were 21 and your state was one of the ones that does medical marijuana id suggest that it has made a positive change for the better in my life and with so many low thc options it doesnt feel like your high as a kite,0

god dammit boogie no one wants to fuck pain well in inverseness they do figure out what works for you as a healing mechanism its here but to dwell on pain and it becomes your master and dominates your thought process is just patheticpain is part of life pain is not life part not whole excuse me ill be in my hole or whole or whatever,0
you are doing it reaching out to us that most have experienced the same thing i go to the extreme when my husband is moody i think what have i done now when i fact has nothing to do with me when im stressed i think oh god he wants a divorce when actually he was in physical pain from falling and did not want me to worry we all do this he sounds like a great guy take it one day at a time,0
yeah it says bipolar isnt related to life events but when life events get crazy which eventually they always do all hell breaks loose and as someone who has bipolar you definitely can have the irritability and sadness and anxiety because youre a fucking person not just a set of clinical symptoms,0
i suff to do i get the racing thoughts and cant sleep i am in my room for the only time i feel about getting back to do something that i want to do i dont get the chance to talk about it with anyone theyre all too busy to talk about it and make a big deal out of it now im going to be going to the hospital and i will be there for awhile my brother call the cops and they are talking about it now im just trying to help myself and my mom is getting worried about this small problem because of my brother call the cops and tells them ive been up since he had to talk about it when im not been sleeping so i am in touch with my life and i am okay well its noting that im not able too fix myself so dont worry about it when you have a hard time with the mood or behavior changes in a manic depression that you are having it feels like hell and you are able to see a doctor go see what happens if you take medicine,0
single mother of an 8 yr old boy i deal with multiple mental health disabilities manic depressive disorder multiple anxiety disorders ptsd etcmy son has picked up my anxiety and he is in therapy just like mommy is he is also old enough for me to talk to him and explain that i am sick and its not his fault and never will be and that i dont want him to grow and have the issues that mommy has when hes older they may be children but they understand when its from the heart hang in there ,1
organic personality syndrome or organic mental syndrome is a mental disorder characterized by a short-term or long-term personality disturbance largely due to brain dysfunction the ability to reason remember imagine and learn may not be affected but the individuals judgment may be so poor that continual supervision may be necessary left unattended he or she may behave in ways that could cause difficult or dangerous problems,1
afraid if someone does this i may break down:(,1
i too have bi polar mixed bi polar and anxiety i often feel numb and doubt if i should be in a relationship i would love to be able to give you some advice but if you are anything like me when some one tries to help me it becomes all scrambled up in my head because of the anxiety all i can say is dont make a decision because you feel guilty for another person you have to do what you feel if you make the decision out of feeling guilt for the other person then it will make things worse for you and the other person but it always has to be what you want ok dont take this to heart ok its just my way of thinking good luck x,0
have you ever had anxiety attack where you think your going to die cause you cant take a breathe,1
im the same way but also as well as dealing with bpd depression anxiety and suicidal ideation just life we deal with what we get,1
if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly you dont need stress wish you all the best get well,0
my pharmacist : " you will feel absolutely horrible for the first two weeks dont stop taking it though you just have to get through the first two weeks" the first two weeks were god damn awful in the end i needed a higher dose but i couldnt afford to go back to my dr it helped my anxiety a lot ( i went from having multiple moderate to severe anxiety attacks every day to like one manageable one) but made me very aloof i wasnt sad anymore but thats because i couldnt really access any of my emotions not sure if that helps but that was my experience with it i would consider going back on a higher dose if i could ( no health insurance at the moment),0
i haventcant and wont let this beat me down!!!!i struggle everyday ,0
oh man how i have struggled with this with a very close friend of mine he isolates himself when he is depressed and i am an over giver one thing ive found helpful in maintaining healthy boundaries is to journal what im thinking and feeling during those times when im really worried about him check in regularly but in a balanced way then when he seeks support you can let him know some of the things you were thinking,0
i was diagnosed with ptsd some yrs back it comes and goes  its mentally traumatic i was in a dv relationship for years but the trauma stays  i have no trust in people i question and over think things to where i get depressed i used to hurt myself cuz i felt hate on myself and tried ending my life several times  i never took meds for this because i was afraid i might do something dumb  so ive learned with therapy to overcome gradually this traumatic mental illness,0
iback in the 90s i was put on benzos to help anxiety and i became addicted over years of use they did mostly help but they made me so tired all the time i couldnt perform my daily duties at home or elsewhere i was taught different breathing techniques and sometimes it worked but sometimes it didnt sometimes a "good" distraction helps calm a person down its been over 20 years now and its definitely improved most days its differant for every person who deals with this just try to do the best you can no one in your life should be asking for anything more out of you than trying to do your best!,1
i would recommend a psychiatrist as well gps get paid a nice stipend for each patient they prescribe certain medications so they may be more likely to encourage one over another thats not necessarily going to be as helpful to you plus they have limited knowledge on a wide variety of things so theyre not going to have the experience to help if you like to read i would also suggest that you pick up a copy of warrior goddess training: becoming the woman you were meant to be and/or feeling good: the new mood therapy i liked the activities in feeling good but i struggled getting through it after a while warrior goddess training im currently reading and really like the idea of shedding societal norms but i do struggle to focus on some of what it says mind you im also a newly single mom of 2 kids ages 2 and 5 so my attention span isnt the greatest!! good luck with whatever you decide,0
talk to your pdoc i agree with suggestions that either a new med or dose might be needed if youre not trying other coping skills or in therapy meds can only go so far motherhood is hugely stressful and therapy is necessary for me i have 8 kids 4-26 all with various issues and some with serious diagnoses too i take time for me or i cant stay well daily meditation and a dedicated sleep schedule are critical,1
happens to me a lot i try my best to stick to my routine but its normally be dialed back instead of a long run just a short easy one to get stretched out at least if i wanted to get 3 assignments for school done that day ill settle for one maybe two maybe even sneak in a nap i really avoid just letting myself veg out all day then guilt/anxiety about not getting anything done makes me shut down again and it becomes a vicious cycle but keeping a consistent and nutricious diet keeping a consistent schedule and routine but still accepting the days im not quite superman helps me the most also remembering to take whatever meds youre prescribed consistently too,0
sex ed terrible movie old haley joel osmont is terrifying,0
ive never known a suicidal person that was thinking rationally its a deep deep hole where self worth doesnt matter and theyve even come to the point that they think their families would be better off without them ive felt it and ive seen it i feel very confident in this belief no its not a selfish act! and thats a horrible thing to say but in those moments the logic of understanding what the life of a survivor would forever be is a big deal and caring about those other people is a lot easier to do than to care about ones self they need support understanding and kindness but this post sounds like an attention getting and not someone so tired with life that they are done,0
my father in law raped me when we were first married my husband was serving in the marines over seas i tried to tell my husband but he was 3000 miles away so i repressed it then whenever i had to see him i would self injure i was a mess seeing him was tearing me apart i finally tried to kill myself over it and everything came out we made ground rules and have stuck by them for 20 yrs now i still flip out when i hear his voice on the phone my husband still visits him periodically its not bothering me as much as it used to praying you find peace and are able to set down some ground rules you are comfortable with,0
i battled with on a daily basis i dont take meds even tho i do be needed it at times but somehow i managed this monster thats inside of me yea i finds myself crying a lot and dont even know why i shake it off of me and keep a pushing ,1
you need to talk to your dr about anxiety meds so many to choose from and so many different doses xanax klonopin ativan talk to your dr asap,1
have a chat with your dr and a psychologist there are some fantastic self help treatments you can try that can really help sometimes in my case i used positive affirmations to change the negative nasty comments id be thinking about myself and it felt wrong and uncomfortable at first but i made a conscious effort to always pay attention to the thoughts that were going through my head and everytime a negative one came id stop myself and force myself to think something positive instead it took awhile but it definately helped and my mind became used to thinking the positive thoughts rather than the negative ☺,1
i use to have all these feelings like everybody else i am reading these posts and i travel back in my mind to feeling this way for so many years i have been slowly getting my old self back my old life before i was over medicated and living in board and care homes and constantly going in and out of psych hospitals i would pray and dream for my life back my dream is coming true and i have been more than stable for 5 years yes i have struggles but i am stronger now mentally please believe it when i say there is hope and i am proof,0
depression and other mental conditions can cause suicide the stigma associated with mental illness cause more suffering guilt isolation and sometimes drive people to take their own life i agree one disease should not be compared to the other & i feel for you and your son but do not underestimate the pain of having a mental disorder in my experience the stigma is greater,1
the good thing is you have survived through the darkness before now youre even stronger enough to get through this too i understand how hard it can be to be overwhelmed with too much emotions hold on tight and dont let it win over you,0
the rage is what scares me the most that one day i wont be able to contain it and go full hulk on someone,0
i take 3 different types of medications for anxiety/depression i hate the fact that i rely on them to feel normal but then i think of the alternative and im grateful to have found medication that works for me!,1
i have a child the same and a partner with adhd i understand somewhat of what you go through its soo stressful,0
the struggle is real,0
i am sorry about the situation your in i would not have anxiety about seeing a doc they are there to help i have been treated for bi polar anxiety ptsd and adhd for over 20 years there are so many medications possible they can give you no one could tell you but you will feel better and dont be afraid of being told your bi polar and you hear all these assign stories of what other bi polar people have done its not you try to relax in a quite place and get some help so you dont feel this way,1
keep a journal when you start so you can tell you doctor what if any symptoms you are having taking it i am only on xanax for anxiety 25 mg,1
antidepressants wont help with anxiety unfortunately,1
it ended my last relationship it was the best decision of my life though they were a very outgoing person i met when i was manic so we totally clicked then of course getting out of the relationship and someone trying to force me every damn day (which only made me feel worse about myself) was great for me i felt horrible about it for a year because she was a great person and had great intentions but i ended up feeling dependent on them again that made you feel less confident getting away from those who push you so hard is very important for your self confidence on topof that you are harming their life if you really do care about them letting them go is the best thing you can do for them even though it sucks you can then find ways to make yourself stronger on your own at your own pace i know thats not what you want to hear but the best therapist in the world will tell you flat out its bad for you and them only harms you both and stops both of you from having better lives drop me a line if you want to k ow my entire experience  ultimately i realize im just not supposed to be in a relationship  its just not healthy makes it harder on me and destroys the other persons life as well good luck !,0
the best way to avoid the big rollercoaster ups and downs is to stay on meds all the time especially a mood stabilizer its so hard i fight it too not wanting my diagnosis or to need meds but i know im better off stable you have to make that appointment and you need to go regularly it helps so much im glad you have a supportive husband mine has been amazing even when i spent us into a crazy amount of debt or baked bread and cookies like a maniac on a four day sleepless bender good luck and hugs,0
i get like you when my anxiety is at its highest peak i have to go and be alone in my room after i disconnect from people and noise it just gets too chaotic at times i can most likely return and try my best to keep as calm as i can anxiety is a monster their are many different meds to help i just happen to be med sensitive to most peace to you!✌,1
i lost track of how many sessions i had and yes i definitely have some memory problems on the other hand the results were dramatic and nothing else pulled me out of the abyss i do not feel uncomfortable telling people to look into it,0
wow so many amazing comments on here and great feedback suicide will always bear a special place of empathy sympathy and compassion in my heart because i have been down that rabbit hole so to speak and have seen the darkness i fear that darkness will return in my life again someday and knowing that terrifies me i can only hope that i have as good a support structure as i do now to get me through future episodes of bipolar and depression i dont think there is a straight answer for when suicide is ok or not ok because on the one hand if you say its never ok arent you undermining the severity of the persons situation? maybe its more humane to let a person go with dignity through assisted suicide? i dont know there are no easy answers,0
this seems to be the trend right now if youre lucky enough to even find a psychiatrist & one thats taking patients its very difficult to be taken seriously in my area you either got the docs that throw anything at you but mostly the ones who do the bare minimum ive been relying on herbal supplements like kava kava or valerian root to help my anxiety,1
anxiety symptoms sweetheart you sound so much like mebut i have severe anxiety panic disorder i dont leave my home go see your doctor and explain everything you said to us you are definitely experiencing some anxiety there a doctor will talk with you and let you know and help you treat it feel better soon chin up and see that doctor :),1
unfortunately i do understand what ur saying i have multiple illnesses and every second of every day is a struggle some days r worse than others!! but i do my best to fight this battle!!,0
its horrible as a man i have problems with it,0
effexor made me more depressed as well it was horrible,0
its horrible when you love someone whos sex drive is atleast 90% lower than your own i consider it a curse i wish i didnt want it as much so i wouldnt annoy her,0
the other scars i view with contempt and shame and want them out of my sight,0
and the guilt is excruciating,0
look at what you do have dont focus on the negative being bipolar is not negative there are some with cancer right now that would trade places with us in a heart beat you said you work full time then thats great! some people struggle to find one i dont know much about your life but for me i started giving myself manicures and pedicures i went for walks and just refected on how i had a job my children were healthy i had a home and food to provide start thinking about everything you do have that someone else might not have and youll find yourself rich in happiness!,0
depends on your diagnosis im diagnosed bipolar 2 and mixed features zoloft made me very irritable and brought out the rage of my bipolar my psychiatrist said zoloft for bipolar is a bad idea because itll flip you into a manic episode (which it did),0
i tried off and on for years but it only made it worse for me i had problems with any job i had my emotional outbursts would be horrible and my ups and downs were incredibly painful then i was diagnosed in my 40s while my cocktail has been adjusted it works but diet therapy psychiatry and other supports are important too balance is the key,0
wellbutrin lamictal topomax busbar and i have xanax for anxiety attacks,1
i have bipolar disorder ptsd and add i had horrible depression and they tried everything under the sun but just kept going down the list zoloft worked then quit so did cymbalta so down the list we continued now i am on paxil abilify which is a godsend! lithium lamictal ativan for anxiety with baclofen adderral for energy and i am finally pretty stable,1
vistaril is a joke it does nothing for anxiety its an allergy med,1
im an apostolic pentecostal and i recently went back to church unfortunately i listened to several churches that brought me to the altar three times trying to throw the "demons" out of me while my three small children watched fearfully i am not possessed its not the devil i am a returning christian and i will also tell you that i found my church by interviewing pastors first i found a great one who understands and does not do that you may have to seek out a different church pray about it and i will be praying with you in jesus name!,1
stop worrying about what you dont have an be thankful for what you do have an when you had that child it became about him not you get in a good church go to class online they have grants,0
im struggling real hard with this right now,0
every one has different reactions and body chemistry im not sure what you are asking? i take a mood stabilizer antidepressant and an anti anxiety i cant take benzodiazepines because of my addictive behavior if what your taking works then stay with it if you are concerned or feel you need something different ask your doctor if you arent seeing a psychiatrist it would help you to do so always give your meds time but also dont rely on others opinions yours and your psychiatrist are what matters good luck!,1
helps my hubby with anxiety wanting to see how he goes with the cubr,1
prudence lowe benjamin my doctor had me on all kinds of medicine at one time but ive never heard of the benzos what is that for anxiety or for depression and why do you say it will kill you what is the side effects to it,0

mine actually told me to for once finish what i started about four months after i tried to commit suicide they are horrible people leave him before it gets worse because it always will,0
not sure i can help but i can empathise im in my 40s and for some reason over the past few years i keep dwelling on the amount of time out of my life thats been wasted because my mh dont know if its getting older but i do find it does become harder to stay positive and not dwell on past especially when things arent that much different but i have actually managed to do some things like join a couple of groups and have met different people which ive never really managed before i plan things ahead to look forward to i think about my children and possibility of grand children,0
you did great celebrate the steps you took even without bpd you would be nervous about the next steps to take to secure a job we always think the worst because we have the illness i try to just worry for the day anything could happen tomorrow you have a better chance of something wonderful happening tomorrow than something bad i will pray for you but you have this,0
i was in the trial studies years back i noticed a change couldnt really pin point what that change was but thought it was better than nothing after continuing for another 4 or 5 years i had to come off of it that was truly the most horrible experience of my life it was worse than coming off of opiates after a few weeks i had to check myself in the hospital for suicidal thoughts(intense thoughts) my mood was vicious angry and unpredictable be very careful taking this drug and even more so when you have to come off of it there are side effects that they have not put on the label and withdraws are one of them,0
thats the only way youll know for sure and be able to get the help you possibly need im bipolar once i was diagnosed i made more sense to myself go theres nothing to be afraid of,0
i have a 2 year old and a 1 month old i took buspar for a short period of time during my pregnancy but it caused me severe insomnia (which i had no problem before starting the meds) i was on lamictal when i found out i was pregnant and had to stop treatment my psych (who is very experienced and well known in the mental medical community) wasnt comfortable with any other options said he would try lithium but it wasnt something he practiced so i would have to sign a waiver stating im aware of the possibility of complications/defects so i refused and went without meds i turned to aromatherapy orange is one of my favorite essential oils to help promote good mood but everyone is different both times i became pregnant it was unplanned though it happened both times during the spring which is a lower stress period for my cycles,1
absolutelydont stressit is a matter of the right meds mixed with a healthy diet and some pot maybe??? helps with anxiety,1

ocd behaviors cause addictive tendencies in people more easily what i have found is to change my obsessive thought patterns (and addiction causing thoughts because of this) into something more productive addictions dont have to technically be a bad thing " the fact or condition of being addicted to a particular substance thing or activity" its not always a substance for me it can be as simple and researching something for animal treats (research has become a huge "positive" addiction for me) or becoming addicted to creating projects to focus on when i am doing badly switch your addictions for something healthy there is a way to do it it just takes a lot of work and youve gotta find something you love enough that is benign or productive enough that it can take its place,1
i gained weight on abilify and had to take it in the morning bc it kept me up at night but it also made my anxiety spike through the rough i am nlw taking valproic acidsee how that works out,1

i also get anxiety about future consequences or outcomes of things that happened in the past so it is sort of a mixture of past and future,1

i think most people say "im bipolar" not because they are defining themselves but because it is easier than stating "i am diagnosed with bipolar disorder" every time they are seeking advice from people who can relate or when they reply to a comment and want the person posting to know what their diagnosis is and whether or not they can relate to their situation and or medication/treatment choices im not sure what exactly the purpose behind your post is but i hope it was not meant to judge or put down anyone who may not express themselves in the same manner as yourself i would like to think that pages such as this are meant for people suffering from mental illness to have a place to be free of negative judgment a place where we can relate to one another support one another seek advice from one another and most importantly speak freely without fear of judgment especially because outside of these pages we with mental disabilities continue to be looked upon negatively we need one anotheror at least i need you all lets love and support one another and yes im bipolar❤,0
god cannot do anything  dont you get it  he was beaten up by his own people and was slammed to the cross just like we are about to be smoked by our very own artificial intelligence robot  i acquired anxiety along the way because i let it and i can beat it  fuck anxiety  im the the saviour of my own not anyone or some heavenly beings ive read about but have never met or seen,0
thats horrible im sorry you went through that,0
i wish i could stop being so nervousit wears me out,1
a close friend was prescribed cymbalta for depression & she got some uncomfortable side effects for the first few days so she ceased the medication the dr told her that was quite common & would probably have subsided within the week,0
do you take anything extra for your anxiety?,1
tired im struggling now to get it all back under control cant find meds that even help about to give up,0
first & foremost dont take the stress of work home with you use the time youre not working doing something you enjoy and relaxing a bit if there is any way to go to local groups that might be helpful too or even religious services if you are a religious person also although i know it can be hard to get up early if you have a lot of fatigue but it really helps to have extra time to get your day started and make your morning routine something that pumps you up and motivates you for the day these are things that help me at least and i hope it can help you too :),1
i have to go for a dry needling appointment later and im scared shitless i also have bpd and right now im at the point where being touched physically hurts,0
ive been battling depression/anxiety/bipolar 1 and a host of mental illnesses most of my 30 years of life i can sit here and tell you inspiring words and stories to make you temporarily feel better but the unfortunate truth is that our minds are so damn stubborn that it will not last for me music finding meaning purpose and ultimately an abundance of hope was key to making what feels like to me a recovery of sorts or at least to be able to manage and control my mind more so than my mind controls me i dont know what that is for you but never stop being curious and wondering about the truth and all the mysteries life has to offer it is truly boundless for me it was this realization that humanity is one and through democracy and engaging ones self in what provides you meaning purpose and hope that i was able to conquer my mind i think it boils down to perspective and dwelling in future possibilities along with support from family friends therapists doctors and medication it takes years to find the right balance of support but i can tell you that once you make it through your hell heaven awaits on the other side i know im talking in vague terms but this is how my mind works and like any other muscle in the body if we train it well the mind can become our most valuable asset instead of our worst enemy although i dont know you i have hope that you will overcome your demons and come out incredibly stronger for it i hope that one day you come to realize this balance and are able to see and feel the positivity that many people bring to this world you are not alone in your darkness,0
support and understanding meds for depression and anxiety to have ppl take my struggles serious  to have good therapy sessions to get the help i need mentally,1
sometimes i get so tired it can be a daily struggle i have good days i never seem to be at my full potential,0
im a recovering self harmer one of the things that helped me was when i wanted to cut i would squeeze ice cubes this sounds stupid but wait! squeezing releases that stress and there is a bit of pain that comes from the coldness of the ice it has been a long hard road this did not always work but sometimes it did i hope this helps someone,0
horrible existence isnt it i been there for decades,0
anxiety meds can help you through this also i carry one of those lavender scented candles in my work bag the little ones you can get at yankee candle taking a few breaths of that candle actually calms me a bit hang in there,1
dont be afraid of how you feel and ask for help it takes a strong brave person to ask for help not a sign of weakness that is just ignorance stay strong ~ s~,1
i know you are right i just worry about what they would think of me,0
i have same problem i want to die but cant when upset it feels like nothing left,0
you know what is worstwhen you trust someone enough to talk about you struggle and they simply reply "there are far more worst things in the world than what you are suffering from get over it dont act like a child!" and then there is than tone in their voice and look in their face that are telling you that "you are doing all these just for attention and you are lazy" right now i am not using any medication but i feel like i am getting stupider day by day i forget most simple tasks like changing my clothes when i want to go out side or i cant tell if i am wearing a sunglasses or notmy head spins sometimes when i wake up i feel pressure in my brain sometimesi am confused most of the times,0
he could be pushing back because of his depression or anxiety i think its very important that even though its a very difficult time for that you understand that its not the right time for him to make a decision he might very much love you but doesnt want to put you through the heartache of what he goes through & push you aw as you away because of that i think too that giving him time & being supportive and loving he will see that you are truly there for the long run who knows maybe thats what he needs to see best of wishes for the both of you,0
going through a shitty day and afraid to say it to my friends was out but it didnt do much good,0
has your dr diagnosed you as having a psychosis or is it just your girlfriend who thinks you do? as for feeling embarrassed about taking meds thats totally untrue whether you take meds for a physical or mental health it doesnt matter its yo help you live your life better,1
ummm more then likely yes seek help immediately hun your ass deep in an episode and sadly its hard to recognize in ourselves because we feel what we feel no matter how irrationalasking means you are recognizing on some level try to find that and call your doct or therepist,0
totally me except insomniai have anxiety but i may have a little depression also,1
the sound would drive me insane shame a breeze is refreshing,0
well put jennifer anxiety is a bitch and shell thrust herself into ur life like theres no tomorrow! anxiety imo is the most harmful of disorders! itll tell u things that just arent true and convince u they are and on and on,1
this inspires me so so much as a teen suffering with anxiety depression adhd and autism and not being able to get a full education because my mental health has robbed me of it i really see hope for my future after reading this ❤️,1
with his history he must be well known to services or have a case worker? if you have contact numbers ring them as soon as you can he is your brother but he is not your responsibility it is never easy to do this he is vulnerable and needs protection as much as you and your family do,0
i have a friend i speak with and my husband but he was at work and she asleep and it wasnt an extreme emergency so i didnt want to wake her and my other social media account was very dead so that is why i posted here and then got paranoid lol i am pretty open about my struggles so the more i thought on it the less paranoid i became i am so sorry those around you do not show the support you deserve and need im lucky to have a pretty tight circle around me,0
i was on 5mg morning and 20mg at night but now i only need 10 mg at night i was put on the stronger dose to deal with bipolar psychosis and now the voices stopped and im taking it to help to stabilise my mood and anxiety i think its great the only side effect i have was on the stronger dose was drowsiness but i got used to it and on the smaller dose i dont feel groggy at all my psychiatrist says its hard to know which one of my drugs is making it hard to lose weight because they all can cause weight gain all in all its a drug that has caused the least amount of side effects remember though everyone is different,1
i worry about that too with my 1 and half year old everyday i know she isnt old enough but family therapy isnt a bad idea when she gets older the more she will understand but before i go off yelling i ask myself is what she doing age appropriate? (such as climbing on things ive told her not to exploring though mommys purse ect) then i verbally identify my feelings and where they are coming from ( i am frustrated because i feel like im not being heard) it helps me alot and gives me a moment to cool off and come back to reality that she is a toddler before causing damage of yelling,0
i got hit by a car and got ptsd and anxiety as a result its hard going out some days but i stick to a routine and it makes it easier to out certain places i push myself occasionally as long as i have my phone to tell me where to go play games etc the main thing about going out is keep their mind off of the things that create the anxiety and of course if the needs arent working back to the drawing board and try again talk therapy works great as well,1
only been on it for 2mths but no probs with sweating is shaking as in hands legs or head an issue for anyone as this has been a huge problem for me at the moment,0
cant help with ur meds but as far as the fact that u stopped drinking well my friend that i can help u with i quit cold turkey and i used pop cycles to get over the drinking it also helped me get over the shakes its not easy to stop drinking but u will be happy that u did i made a promise and am happy that i have kept it for the past 13 years now but i always tell people i am a recovering alcoholic and always will be it would only take one drink to get me going again and i will not do it cause i will lose the one i love the most in this world and i dont want that if u need to talk about this problem friend me will be glad to talk to u,0
a little break in life for me was 4 years of isolation very bad i am bipolar withe anxiety and ptsd and on top of that im an alcoholic in recovery,1
hey all i am a bit older and have been dealing with this my whole life- can i offer some insights? #1 we need to accept that we are different/special people we are loners and leaders innovators and dreamers we have been trained by the capitalistic media and our culture that we must live in a house with a mate and work and be productive and not make waves well let me tell you that that will never work for you and you need to give up that fantasy i decided to live alone and not involve myself in committed/romantic relationships about about ten years ago i have never been as healthy and happy as i have been since then not having to worry about the pain you cause a significant other with you mood swings and all the other bs that goes with it is incredibly liberating i instead find joy and purpose through helping others especially young people i have more friends than before i have boundaries for my friendships to keep things less emotional i now accept my craziness because it doesnt harm anyone when i am unhealthy i keep people at a distance when i am healthy i strengthen and create new ties as people grow older become more wise and mellow i believe they can learn to embrace their unique neurochemistry and figure out how to use it for good good luck to you all,0
i am a christian and yes i would be hurt offended and very upset by someone saying that to me run dont walk out of there! it does not mean you have to give up your faith just that that particular church is not for you i am so very sorry you had this happen to you and there is also no way to cleanse the mental illness out of your dna those people sound very uneducated and judgemental ,0
its beautiful to share here without fear of being judged and to receive support,0
gosh i felt sooo uncomfortable talking to my doctor about this part of it but it not just me! i go in waves and have hyper sexual times but the worst part is i make bad decisions when this happens talking about it helps and yes it is normal for us that have this as part of our disorder liking it rough and wanting marks to be left by your partner is something i enjoy looking at after the fact when hes not around rough but not abuse so perhaps she just misspoke of her desire,1
just really struggling at the moment ive been given some numbers to call,0
medication will reduce anxiety & depression whilst seeking professional support learning ways to manage anxiety/depression symptoms i have qualifications in aod & mental health so its not a half arsed comment,1
many people (including me) suffer from this and its apparently part of anxiety i googled for it and a lot of links came up i personally looked at them as biochemical errors and did not worry about them however i did seek and continue treatment for anxiety which made my life so much more pleasant others cannot see your thoughts but i think you are suffering greatly from this problem and its totally desirable and worth seeking professional help you are not strange youre perfectly human!,0
ive been on numerous medications also- idk specifics about you of course area dr insurance etc but i had a genetic test done - paid for by insurance thankfully and turns out my "body type" can only respond to 4 types of medication none of which i had tried- currently in trying the third one on the list- and it helps for the most part- the test also told me about interactions with sleeping medication and how actually my body works against them i dont know much about lithium but i know its an option to avoid - anyways genetics testing might be an option for you- good luck -,1
i have been diagnosed with bp2 ptsd and anxiety i currently take 1500 depokate in the morning & 400 serquoel in the evening ive never been more content dont get me wrong not everyday is a cake walk i use to be on lamictal and it worked wonders with that being said research the drug closely after long periods of time it can possibly cause gastrointestinal issues i then had to be taken off all my meds one by one slowly all while losing weight from being sick,1
i am on 200 mg of neurotin at bedtime for a total of 600 mg per day seroquel is the guilty party in weight gain i used to be on 300 mg each eve & gained as much weight as you no matter what i do it is impossible to lose i have tried exercise and different diets (i don t eat a lot) except this med causes me to crave carbs at night,1
been battling since first breakdown in 1966 it doesntt get any easierhorrible!,0
last psychotic episode i took i was hearing things i was convinced the guy upstairs had drilled holes in ceiling and to spy on me and i could see writing appearing on wall i was sat in dark hall way hiding terrified to move for hours until my son came home he knew something was wrong with me but it all seemed very real to me until the hospital explained what was happening i was put on medication to stop hallucinations for a few weeks and opted to go home with a cpn popping in every day for a week to check on me scary stuff at time but with support of my son i got through it x,0
oh my gosh that is scary wish i could start sleeping regularly,1
you know what else sucks? (pun intended) always looking at someone on the street and staring at their package it doesnt matter if its male or female i always look its horrible my husband calls me a meat gazer and laughs about it but its crazy so shaun clark i can totally relate,0
i think ur manic episode might have come on cause ur worried what might happen during that period ur waiting for ur meds just thinking ,1
im feeling that to my anxiety is omg i went off on my husband and said lots of mean things im depressed moody sad crying i even told him cause im pms ing didnt want to go anywhere and we did and i regret every minute of it,0
interesting michelle that you mentioned that you get that irritation feeling in your body bcuz im experiencing that! i didnt know a good way to describe it but thats it! im diagnosed bipolar (last year) and general anxiety - i currently take 150 mg seroquel 40 mg celexa 20 mg paxil and 1 mg xanax at night (but i just stopped taking the xanax a few days ago) but now im wide awake anyway i have that same odd sensation i was going to mention to my dr next week,0
im wondering what are their reasons for not believing u thats gotta be really hurtful and hard to deal with you should be very proud of yourself for having made it this far without their support you are very strong for that as for advice candace couldnt have said it any better but i have a feeling something will happen to open their eyes when you are patient and focus on bettering yourself instead of stressing and fighting everything else usually tends to fall in to place good luck i hope it works out for u,0
ive got borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder its nothing like did what i personally do is google things when i need to get info if you arent getting many answers here (because maybe we dont know either) google is good :) just start off with "what is the difference between?" or you could ask your doctor?,1
my daughter and i are bipolar we make statements like this often to each other only when we are in private amongst each other it is our way of trying to find humor in such a horrible illness gives us a reason to laugh and understand at the same time we suffer sever depression with ours and the moods swings so when we can laugh its great,0
im 40 with bpd bipolar depression anxiety etc i also lack the ability to recall most of my childhood n have problems maintaining thoughts at the age of 40 its depressing to have lived half your life n not remember most of it i wish so much that i could remember i dont think its worth your past i know i wish i had mine but thats just from someone who is very depressed with no memory,0
my son has depressed but he didnt want to tske meds he was on something but its hard to try and make s 20 old tske his meds very stressful for me at times cause i didt no how to help him i am on zofol hes doesnt want to tsk gl no one so were do i turn for help for him,1
this is disturbing and should be taken down,1
just happened last night for first time ive never been so scared in my life,0
ooo i am scared i will take my medicines,1
oh yeah after my first miscarriage i spiraled down a dark depression hole i hadnt been down in a long time almost destroyed my relationship with my now husband i needed to mother something so when i brought up getting a kitten my husband jumped on it and agreed ended up finding a bonded pair siblings we couldnt separate so they both came home with us they pulled me out of that hole and saved me and my relationship my boy is currently curled up on my hip as i type hes always near me and knows when im upset or sick and he takes care of me,0
all i can say is that i hope that you will get back into school and dont let your fears and anxieties stop you i know it is very hard but you will be that much prouder of your achievements knowing what you go to to get things done i used to go to work in high anxiety every day i said a prayer i heard somewhere i said to god god i know that nothing is going to happen to me today that you and i can not handle together that prayer helped because when ever anything happened i knew that god was with me i faced the situations i believed much more in myself,0
i have bpd and i used to think it was bipolar because i couldnt control my anger and would constantly have major rage fits and outbursts but i was diagnosed with bpd and im now in dialectical behavioural therapy for it to learnt to control my emotions it has saved me from myself i suffer from constant anxiety and depression along with unstable moods and constant fear of abandonment its hard to deal with but now that i know what my problem is learning about it comes easily and is easier for me to help myself but you need to be persistent with your psych and if they dont help you to find out your diagnosis than you need to keep trying with others until you find one that will diagnose you i tried and tried and i couldnt find the help i needed until one night when i took myself to hospital to the psych ward very suicidal they had a proper psych come in and sit with me for 3 hours asking me all these different questions about my past and present and my moods and anger troubles in a week he had me in proper therapy to figure out what was wrong with me and i was finally diagnosed ever since ive made it priority to learn about my diagnosis and do everything i can to make myself better and change the way my mind processes its hard so hard but the more i keep doing it the better im becoming i tried medication after medication councillor after councillor psychiatrist after psychiatrist until i finally found one that i liked and who gave proper time for me and made sure to do everything in her will to help me she started printing out modules of how to deal with distress intolerance and made me work through them and learn to control the way i react to my distressing situations made me work out what my triggers and warning signs were etc ive come so far in only 8-9 months and im proud of that but i know im not yet where i want to be and still have a long way to go but if it wasnt for me persisting to get help the right help i wouldnt be where i am today you just need to be persistent yet patient at the same time you will get there just keep trying and do your best to find both a psychiatrist and psychologist whom not only helps you to figure out your problems but also makes you feel comfortable and able to talk about everything and anything that could help diagnose you if you cant find one that helps you feel like youre getting somewhere with things go to the hospital and admit yourself for assessment i had to to get the right help you dont need to stay there its just for the right assessment instead of those k10 forms that doctors fill out to diagnose depression and anxiety and stuff its not that simple and it takes a long time to dig deep to figure out the problem it cant take 5 minutes just keep trying you will get there,1
thnk u so much for the caring and kind words unfortunately my father was not a good man he was an alcoholic and would beat on my mom and younger sister and i hated him for tht i never have a good role model growing up so tht is why i think i am doubtful of being a good dad bc i never had a good dad to teach me about morals,0
i will pray for you i dont know you but i know exactly how you feel took the words out of my mouth too but im the kind of person that me killing my self or someone killing me is one thing but i dont wish it upon others id rather it be me than someone else i pray you get through your struggles and internal trials ,0
im on 100mg lamictal twice a day and really took my time building up to 100mg from 25mg my side effects are similar i do tend to "hear" things (not voices) and even with my fan going i still "hear" things i do get paranoid and sometimes i have to get up to look around just for my sanitys sake i also experience something that i can only describe as "evil" and feel like im being watched in my sleep as well as in my dreams i always wake up freaked out and i have to go get out of bed and read a book to help me calm down,0
wellbutrin didnt help me at all and in fact im positive it increased my anxiety i talked to my pharmacist and they said that its known to cause anxiety and not always the best option for someone with it,1
same! it stresses me way out,0
apps are extremely helpful for in-between sessions to learn about breathing techniques and to keep anxiety under control,1
lithium worked great for me until i found out i was pregnant after i was done breastfeeding i got back on and it was horrible for me severe insomnia hallucinations couldnt drive vision changes,1
most lately that shaky cam thing everyone does bad,0
dont let your boyfriend continue to rule your life if he had chosen to leave you from your post im guessing you are fairly young are you still living at home? with a baby on the way you need support from family and friends dont ignore them ask for support its nothing to be ashamed about,0
im so sorry to hear that its horrible to be in that situation hopefully you found something to help if not writing do you draw? or something else? sometimes the distraction is the best thing for coping in the immediate if hes usually like this might be time to move on trust me when i said i made the jump and you dont need someone to survive you are strong in yourself and if youre worried about being lonely if youve got the time and resources maybe consider a pet? my cat is my saviour when im not doing well she knows and comes and gives me cuddles also your parents have no right telling you that you have to fix things when its causing you severe distress to be with him they should support you making the best decisions for you!,0
today went good although i avoided ppl/family to get thru with no explosions or break downs 2 steps forward 3 back but i am happy i wasnt in bed or stuffing my emotions w food,0
im afraid to try bc i dont want to start al over but i have gained 30 pounds i still have mini but workable cycles,0
yes full neuropsych testing have me my iq strengths weaknesses and an adhd inattentive type diagnosis on low dose focalin it wired up the anxiety tho chemical balances are so intriquite,1
let her ignore you and dont take it personally maintain your own hobbies and such too -- these struggles can consume people around us too you stay healthy and look after yourself too support by being stable and steady and just wait fir when she is able to re-engage,0
im 59 and when i was growing up mom was manic depressive we knew she was manic when shes be up in the middle of the night cleaning sometimes talking to the wall etc i rarely mentioned her illness when young stays in mental hospitals now as an adult her illness is nothing to be ashamed of my momma fought the fight every day love her rip momma,0
this may be part of the story of my life but i have no shame in doing what it takes to be well my life is worth it and i can tell you im well! :),0
i used to feel like that im everybodys first call when there in trouble but when i need support no one comes because i act strong people assume independent when im anything but! i learned to say no and put myself first by explaining dealing with there negative emotions when trying to help them added to mine like a sponge i soaked up there feelings as im really empathetic this year i told anyone if things in there life become toxic or stressful please take my emotional state into consideration before relying on me to fix your dramas as every time i do i loose a part of myself and one day i may be broken beyond help it was hard to say but i done it for myself because no one else was ever gonna put my needs first took me years to realize that x,0
i must be the only one that fears my bed anywhere is better then in that prison that offers nothing but an endless stream of painful thoughts,1
i think you shouldnt have to pick between them they are your parents that said if they push you to choose that can be hard i know i have to constantly remind myself: my parents are human have faults make mistakes i turn 25 tomorrow and i think teen/young adult you see more of reality (kinda like if you ever went to someone for homework help and one day after some years your questions pass what they can help you with or you catch mistakes) that your parents arent the exact way you thought as a kid creates a lot of stress at that age alone my mental health stuff was diagnosed in my 20s my parents have little experience in this dept and i have learned i cannot force people to learn cant get them to try not to say or do things that can lead me to get fairly sick i can learn ways to adapt to the environment i am given so for that i honestly think a professional support system for you is first and foremost i kind of blew off importance of psychotherapy biofeedback focusing on the physiatrist and meds not smart for my situation i have done the opposite (off meds thinking i could muscle through) and i have spun my wheels going nowhere frustrated for a long time thinking since i tried doctor or therapist a and b and it didnt work so it must be me this is as good as it gets dont bother looking for option c same concept with meds but i think if you seek out a mental health care professional that you can trust and that is listening to you they not only help you navigate other stuff but also help you in how to address the parent thing how to navigate through those who do have impact on your health but whose actions you cant directly control i think that is huge but often overlooked not only will you learn skills as tools for getting through those issues but it will give you some solid ground to come back to and stand on through that therapist/doctor if you are seeing someone now be honest with yourself if you arent progressing: is it a simple fix on your end or do you just not click? shuffling around happens all the time,0
for me personally it was terrible i felt much much worse my anxiety went up and i was tired all the time,0
yeah get your stuff and leave be with your family not someone whos going to stress you out dont live your life for him live it for yourself,0
i feel exactly the same my son is 22 now now but i feel ive been a terrible mother and he deserved better hes had so much to put up with from such a young age he was 10 when i got diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar i talk to him about it which is usually when im depressed and he always says ive been a fantastic mam and that theres no need to worry about it he said he had a really good up bringing and couldnt have been more loved ive been a single mother from him being 6 your children will probably say the same to you one day were good parents but just have more to deal with than other families x,0
have you thought of other alternative medicine like cannabis i have depression and anxiety and it helps keep me calm,1
friends should not make you feel terrible thats not a friend i dont know who that is but you should probably either tell them to knock it off or dump them from your life you do not need that "actual friends" dont walk away just because youre having issues thats not a good friend either they may need to set boundaries that are healthy and appropriate so they dont get overstressed or burned out dealing with your mood swings but they dont just walk away that will make you feel worse and it seems like you dont need to feel any worse your "actual" friendshave you tried reaching out to them again? apologizing and explaining where you are mentally? if theyre really your friends theyll come back to you as for your familydo you have grandparents a cousin or an aunt you can go to if your parents have walked away from you? are you getting therapy? if not you should definitely be doing that for yourself are you on any meds? if so stick with them if youre feeling worse on those medications do not be afraid to tell your therapist that they arent effective theres a lot of other meds they can try until you find something that helps with your depression and your anxiety rememberyoure only 17 you still have a long life ahead of you where you can make friends who will be there for you dont give up my best wishes are with you,0
there is!! oh honey hang in there the road is hard but youre not alone im here even with whatever distance is between us i understand that spot of fear and unknowing i lived it for longer than i thought bearable you are so loved!! im not just saying this i really will be here for you message me if you need to vent let me hold your hand ,0
the best to avoid missing a dose or double dosing is to use a pill container,1
get a referal to a psychiatrist i was diagnosed around 21 (mother also bp) dont worry you will find the rights meds but antidepressants alone are no good for bp as they can get you manic if you are bp you will also need a mood stabaliser such as lithium good luck ,1
i have taken seraquel for years and it helped with my agitation i take it at night and sleep good now that my anxiety is better before i took trazdone for sleep it works great but as my anxiety improved it would make me tired,1
i feel like worse days are ahead of me especially financially because i rely heavily on my mom for financial support im on disability and im 30 years old now first got disability when i was 19 anyone on disability knows its not enough to live off of i cant handle the stress of working im such a failure when it comes to being an independent adult sorry just need to vent somewhere,0
i do it too but not much help because when im in the middle of it im not aware its happening i just irritate the snot out of everyone around me,0
i too felt wonderful while pregnant! i chose to stay on low doses of medications i tried going off but couldnt all 3 of my kids are healthy there are stresses wheb pregnant and obviously worse with a baby when your time is right you will know it you dont have to have a baby if its not right for you my anxiety got worse then better everyone is different tho and now i constantly worry about being a good mother and doing the right thing good luck sweetie,1
its the state you get yourself into that makes you want to do it then its the feeling that you become addicted to this is why the temptation is always there i recently told my psych that if they could create a pill that gives you the same feeling as when ive self harmed (cut) id be fixed! of course thats not true but it just proves what a desperate state you find yourself in to want to harm yourself in order to feel better i have resisted the temptation & not harmed myself for 2 months now & whenever i feel that temptation creeping in i call my best friend who knows how to talk me down,0
this is what scares me about getting back on meds a doctor wouldnt just tell a diabetic to stop taking their insulin i am constantly going back and forth over the struggle to find the right dosage or trying to trust a dr again its so frustrating,1
i need to be on meds or i lose touch with reality get very paranoid and slip into a psychosis i have bipolar 1,1
any change effects us so you should know going home and being afraid is normal!,0
im on both one anxiety lamictl for bipolar one works great no side effects,1
i couldnt do with out my meds yes know the feeling cant go out today and getting on train or driving frightens me to deadfeeling numb myself and yes no one understandsi only good thing is it will pass and your gone out the other side but it rules my life so isolating and a horrible feeling and illnessj,0
shes speaking about her battles & looking for some comforting words if not suggestions to help her situation compassion never hurt anyone every person who is a part of this page would appreciate this i find your comment unnecessary "if you dont know what shes asking if anything" dont comment if it were on my post id be upset!,0
awww arlene im just a call away dont ever hesitate we can have a blether over a cuppa xx,0
propranolol works well with me im also on abilify and lamictal the only thing is that it does have a tendency on lowering your heart rate and blood pressure so i do look out for that with my pulse oximeter (excluding blood pressure),1
depression is a misnomer for an illness of the brain where serotonin and brain cells are depleted the nervous systems lines of communication are tangled into unbearably painful knots,1
hugs and prayers dont hesitate to get professional help you are worth it,1
i dont have depression or bipolar disorder but i do have a chronic illness that makes it really hard sometimes all you can do is the best you can take care of yourself its not as if you asked to have depression or anxiety if someone cant understand and be compassionate then they may not be the right person i have lost alot because of illness including friends and romantic relationships the ones that took the time to try to understand i value the most so sorry this happened positive thoughts sent your way :),1
as long as it works for youwhos anybody to say differently?weed works for my bipolar bf!not so much for methoughi meanit does calm me downyesbut does it take my depression away??not alwaysdoes it take my anxiety away?sometimesbut sometimes it actually makes it worseso im forced to still take my geodontrilleptalzoloftklonopin and ambieneverydaytil i die,1
yep ive got klonopin (clonazepam) lamictal and cymbalta on board but actually going to the doctor today as depression/anxiety have gotten worse lately jill jorgensen i was wondering if bipolar and bpd could co-exist i knew it! yay for us  we get both :( though i have bipolar type 2 my best to everyone youre not alone,1
so just an update to those who want it :) i saw the doctor she was so unhelpful its not even funny said that i should have gone to my gp with the pain and other symptoms after getting upset with her she admitted that i could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests said that i must stop the lithium and if im not better by monday i must go to my gp and ask for tests i demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until i have seen my neuro to get better help with my seizures she insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which i have been told numerous times that i cant have and told me i must come back in 3 weeks unless the anti depressant makes me manic then i must come back sooner i am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today but im living in hope waiting to see my neuro in hope that i can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thanks to everyone for their support,0
lamictal saved my life started on 25 upped very slowly to avoid rash now on 300 mg been on it 15 yrs im bipolar 2 psychiatrist has had to adjust antidepressants over the years to keep depression at bay but mania is controlled perfectly and the constant roller coaster of moods is gone i used to cycle a lot my daughter is bipolar 2 as well and is on 200 mg lamictal also,1
i stopped all meds when i was pregnant then continued them after i had baby so i was not able to breastfeed and things were hard during my pregnancy but to me the bad days were worth knowing that i was doing what was best for my kids and not taking chances i understand why some women opt to stay on meds but for me it just wasnt a risk i was willing to take and while i had suicidal thoughts i knew that i never would act on them while i was pregnant so i just dealt with everything until baby was born and continued therapy,0
i feel like this is a version of the decision i have to make when someone asks how im doing do i give them the polite answer or the real one? not always an easy decision to make nor is it ever comfortable and i also have been on the other end sometimes it is not helpful to me to be on social media and sometimes it is not helpful to my health to hear about someone i care much about is struggling because i really do take all of that upon myself (i was told by a friend that my skills in being so sympath/empathetic was a gift but often times it is more of a curse) however i think the best thing you can do in this situation is to thank said family member for communicating that to you and offer them steps they can take to avoid seeing such posts it is possible to stay friends with someone and not see their posts on the newsfeed (this past election year for the us i learned real quick how to do that to extreme friends on all sides ;) )  keep your cool and remember it could be as simple as them not getting it or maybe not being able to handle it and approaching you about it (even if it was in a rude way) if it is really messing with your day wait to respond until you are feeling a bit better (i definitely know how this goes you dont want to ruminate excessively on a response nor do you want to say something you will regret later or be anxious about it i assume as a family member you will have to interact with this person again regardless what is said on facebook) again if the posts you make are helpful to you i feel you should be able to continue them without regret but maybe in the response if you feel comfortable doing it explain that to said family member how it is helping you by posting while acknowledging that it may not be helpful to him/her and presenting fair options to help this person filter it on their end,0
both of these medications can cause anxiety and depression they are very strong antipsychotic drugs using them for anxiety is comparable to using heroin for a headache anxiety can be tamed with a class of meds from benzodiazepines or even antihistamines you may also find relief from cognative behaivor learning triggers and coping skills with out medication we must all be careful of how medications are used and perscribed to us,1
mdd-major depressive disorder and ironically depression and anxiety tend to go hand in hand,1
my daughter suffers bpd & is so hard to watch her struggle~sandi~,0
sorryposted before i finished writing! i know they are very expensive to prescribethat is why they are not given out until you have tried other medication they honestly are really good i have not have any problems with them except when i started taking them even then it was just getting used to them i have been on them for several years nowbut from how i am feeling nowi know they work my gp did tell me that if & when i reduce the dosageit should be in the summer & not when its bad weather he said the winter can make people with depression/anxiety feel low anyway i really hope these work for you gabrielle xx,1
this is the only medication i have been able to take ive only been on it 2 weeks and already noticed massive improvement with my anxiety and i havent cried once no nasty side effects neither! i can eat and i am now able to sleep at night without sleeping pills its helped me so much,1
i was on a low dose of seroquel to help me sleep and help my moods it did the trick except for 1 side effect i had the most terrifying nightmares in my life i would wake up feeling so anxious it wasnt worth the stress cut cold turkey with no symptoms but again it was a low dose i tried trazadone after that and had hangover symptoms (nausea vomiting migraines) now im on invega i dont snap as much or as easily as i used to but still dont sleep well,1
just joking but must b hard this i dont really suffer from it just anxiety hope i made you smile i mean no offence,1
she should see a doctor as soon as possible ive literally been where you are and now my son is dead dont be afraid of her being angry with you now she will forgive you my prayers are with you,1
you know that you have to go to a therapist and tell the therapist all this but you also know that god cares seek him again every day know that he is there for you have confidence in him eat a good diet and have some things in your life that make you happy forget about what people might think of you it absolutely does not matter what matters is that god loves you so completely and totally he never leaves you and you are going to get through this this is a tough time of your life you need to take care of yourself you have to have some friends you can go to a support group with nami or a peer support group you can invite someone over for coffee and chose to ignore your fearful feelings you can go for a walk someplace pretty you can read the bible and you can tell yourself positive truths you can put on some uplifting music and do some art work or crochet or knit you have to have things to look forward to! i am really getting into growing things i have stuff on my apartment patio i spent money on good organic potting soil if i did not have a patio i would get really cheap succulent plants and propagate them you can take parts of one plant and get a lot of other plants to grow it gives you something to look forward to i have some cats and kitties cuddling is really nice when you are single as far as the family accepting you make it clear that you are glad you are part of their family call them up and ask how they are try to call at good times for them it is worth the effort my oldest sister always acted like i was bothering her when i called because she was always busy and irritable and sick i knew she wasnt feeling well i think if you call family that you want to know better you will get to know them better ask some of them over for cake and coffee lunch or dinner god to church and meet some nice people dont feel self conscious meeting people you dont have to like all the people and they dont all have to like you but you will make some friends if you continue to go if one church does not work out try another and another the library has ways to meet other moms also kids sport events we can have horrible pasts and god can heal us and make us strong i know that this is true because i am 61 and i lived through a lot of horrible times like you did try to be there for your kids the way you wished someone had been there for you as a kid do stuff with your kids and dont let yourself pull away from them they need you play games with them go out with them it raises your spirits but moderation in all things you need to rest get a good physical too as sometimes it is physical illness that zaps our energy and makes us depressed have faith that things will get better do what you can to make them better keep in touch with the son who stays with family dont let that break your heart maintain contact and let him know you love him and you are there for him on a regular basis,0
unbelievable thats exactly how i feel daily in my life! i ask kneel pray to jesus christ for strengh guidance protection comfort healing relax one day at a time sweet jesus thats all i do i dont wish this ugly mental illness on anyone not even my worst enemy my insomnia barely sleep one or three hours if i get a chance to sleep forever very dramatic drained exhausted fustrated feeling horrible mad upset i was diagnosed with bipolar anxiety depression since the age of 13 years as the years accumulated my mental illnesses gets worse and worse i rarely socializing cant be around hardly no human beings the noise is so fustrating sirens music machinery operatorsget very irritable! its just not fair but thats reality!!! so yes! all my love respect care compassion to everyone whom is dealing with this horrible mental illness lets please continue to communicating w each other and give one another our postive in puts stay strong to survive!!!,0
i think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way because the human experience is just so different due to perspective i like the way you both calmly talked about this so id like to put in my perspective i think you are both right selfish is not the right word however what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate they have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath they are thinking only of themselves but on the other hand this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question most suicidal people dont have the capacity to even think that far ahead the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain i have struggled with mental illness my entire life i grew up very poor and a homeless youth during this time i didnt even know the thoughts i had were not "normal" my mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding i attempted 3 times not once did i consider going to family or friends i didnt have family that loved me (still dont) and i didnt have close friends im sure even if i did i wouldnt have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone the internal fight isnt about anyone else its only about you its a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isnt working by therapy meditation lifestyle fitness yoga meditation etc during this time we have to be selfish we have to be inconsiderate because if we arent we will die living is not for someone else its not for anyone else its for me i recently decided i needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this february i found out im bipolar boarding between 1&2 im somewhere in the middle i also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse i understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle and that incredible pain you feel is your brain keeping you alive its far too complex to answer this question but it could provide insight to others,0
im a sh survivor i know the pain of depression anxiety and being alone you can get through this baby steps one day at a time change doesnt happen over night but it does happen you are courageous for reaching out for help keep using your courage to reach out you can do this much love,0
that drug saved me i have bipolar depression anxiety and sleep problems and taking zyprexa ive been able to fall asleep within an hour of taking it an actually sleep through the night and wake up rested i didnt get mood swings and my depression was better highly recommend,1
might be best to have 3/4 cup today then 1/2 cup the next day then 1/4 cup  etc will avoid withdrawal headaches by easing off slowly,1
i need to share this to my family they dont understand depression and anxiety,1
been on it a couple of years withdraws is huge! i got very suicidal and felt terrible paranoid etc its worked ok for me i still have difficulty during hormonal time,0
scary,0
hey im so sorry to read youre not feeling well my first thought was: are you or have you in the past 4 yrs received any treatment or medication for your anxiety & im guessing depression? have you spoken to anyone including a dr about how youre feeling right now? if not can you do that before you resort to self harm? i know its hard ive lived with a variety of mood disorders since my early teens so appreciate how youre feeling i encourage you to take the first step & find someone you trust that you can share your struggle with blessings ,0
if societies expectations and institutionalisation wasnt so limited we wouldnt be suffering from these mental states we are not born into this world to be trained and taught how to live in only one acceptable state we are here for a purpose to share our natural positive gifts that cannot shine or enlighten us in a blinded high society that corrupts all that is natural and beautiful in ourselves and our beautiful world of abundance created to sustain us and all living things instead we bow down to monarchy and legal chaos to survive not intune with the divine essence of our human race but the disgrace of hypocricy and uncertainty of ourselves,0
nuvaring! it was my favorite and im also bipolar with ptsd anxiety and severe depression,1
i have anxiety and depression and my diagnosis is bipolar largely because of these two polarities if you are acting 180 degrees out of character you can suspect manic behavior,0
i would check your diagnosis as suggested by others to confirm if you are bp1 or 2 (from what you said sounds like bp2 when depressive episodes more frequent and hypomania episodes rather than mania or have bpd you could have cooccurring diagnosis such as anxiety depression compulisive behaviour etc which meds can help or you,1
go to a psychologist and talk about it you probably do you would know i was diagnosed 8 years ago and everybody has to walk a different path but i would avoid the anti-depressants theyre not effective in treating ptsd and thats all they got avoid any anti -anxiety drugs theyre all highly addictive and stop working after awhile research cannabis it helps with concentration and losing interest some strains can exacerbate symptoms so dont rely on past experience and dont go out and get a joint from a friend thats what ive learned in those 8 years trying to save you some pain talking to a psychologist and using their techniques helps and thats it finding one thats not an idiot is another storylol,1
are u confused? or are u just stupid? do u know who ur talking to? idk about the other people commenting on this page but this isnt about big pharma the meds we take keep us from killing ourselves hurting ourselves hurting others keeping certain chemicals in our brain on track gtfo,1
my experience too work wasnt understanding and on top of it i had coworkers threaten me as well as supervisor ended up walking out and getting baker acted now trying for disability difficult surviving let alone dealing with the disorder prayers for all,0

hi debra i have issues to the one thing that really upsets me is people not understanding they call me lazy keep saying how is it you go to bed so early every night saying you feel so tired when you hardly do any physical activity i tried to explain that a person can become so mentally drained stressed and other things that it wears them out physically and thats why we get so tired but they still dont understand vikki tempest,0

you might struggle to sleep,1
i still am not sure what is wrong with me but my gp is treating for anxiety but ready this is helping a bit thank you,1
i ache all over it takes me about half an hour to rev my joints up i find sport relieves my aching painful body but it takes real self motivation to do as i doubt my ability then the anxiety and headsweats kick in but i have to do it to keep supple and i feelat my best when i do sport,1
ive been able to skip the self harm lately very hard but still go thru the shame/grief from just having wanted to do it,0
you dont say what your diagnosis is but you are taking meds for a range of mental health illnesses depokate is primarily for bipolar latuda is primarily to treat schizophrenia cumbalta is and anti depressant ritalin is a stimulating mainly for adhd impulsive behaviour and xanax anxiety panic disorder you are not only over mediated but combination of some of these meds are potential dangerous and will coutaract each other i would seriously find out what your diagnosis do you have schizophrenia or experience psychotic symptions such as hearing voices hallunications delusions paranio or bipolar? if not i would determine why you on these meds you need to research the meds you take,1
are you elevating your hand? try smaller meals soup scrambled eggs cream of wheat hot cereal make sure you keep drinking fluids try watching some of your favorite tv shows know that you didnt feel this way two days ago think about last weekend and what you did remember some good times and know that when your hand is a bit better youll be out again this feeling is horrible right now but it will pass as it always has,0

the only way it worked with my husband is him educating himself on the disorder before me he had no idea what was bpd he needs to have patience and to respect your space and you respect his space we can be overwhelming sometimes and for someone that doesnt have a disorder can be pretty hard to understand good luck xox,0
i used to have full blown panic attacks any time i had to drive long distances and had to pull over and go into a gas station bathroom for 30 mins or more just to calm down i finally got klonopin i take once a day or twice if needed and i do okay i d still rather not drive and be a passenger and have my tablet to keep me occupied on long trips,0
im on 7 neds for severe bipolar one anxiety and adhd it makes me so thankful to have an awesome psyc dr who really cares and helps me without the mess id live in hospitals,0
tell your doctor about the restless legs; if the depakote is causing it they can find you another med rls by itself can make you feel suicidal let alone with a pre-existing situation the affordable care act is still in place so if you dont have health insurance go to the emergency room this is an emergency,0
i know you dont want to but going to the hospital may be your best bet you are more important than your familys views dont worry about them yelling at you you can ask the hospital to not allow them to visit you you do what you need to even if its against the wishes of the family youre loved and you will get through this ,0
oh wow thank you so much kathy lilly for your encouragement im once again having to switch doctors my mine closed their practice sometimes i feel that my pcp does not take me seriously they have pushed me to another psychiatrist but my insurance doesnt cover in my area so now i have to worry about paying out of pocket its just crazy and i feel that there is no end to this my panic attacks had started getting better but now they are full blown again i dont understand this ive always been very intelligent outgoing and articular and now i dont feel it anymore i watched my mother suffer from mental disorders and i always vowed that i would not let my children see me go through something that like but the damn cycle continues,0
that depends are you part of the 60 percent that are likely to use drugs or the 40 percent that dont have substance issues? note the terms " expected to struggle " just because you have the cravings doesnt mean you give in to them it just means you struggle with them you pious sanctimonious self righteous little prick,0
im bipolar anxiety depression im on buspar seraquil 50mg am 200 mg night lithium hydroxide plus hydrocodone for paid im if you need to chat,0
omg melany bass same here even though the highs have feelings of no pain no fear like not a care in the world i still become destructive with my behavior and decisions for me though my lows although i work threw them are extremely low thats where the self harm comes in just to have some sort of relief or distraction,0
i listen to this it works sometimes but not when im overly anxious,0
lost so very much of my life confused about dates or whether something really happened or when i suffer from bipolar/unstable personality disorder im awaiting pip letter bomb on my mat and am terrified making everything worse now have disacociative disorder with non epileptic seizures/blackouts had one this morning and a friend said i was out for over a minute im 62,0
i really struggled with sertraline it made me worse,0
im sometimes afraid of living and that terrifies me i have cried immediately after waking up simply because i was still alive i actually have people who love me a wife etc and none of it is good enough to change my illness,0
every so often i get really bad chest pain at the sternum and i become unable to take deep breaths until it goes away ive gone to the doctors a few times over the years for it and each time because i also have shoulder pain they completely ignore the respiratory issue hook me up to an ekg tell me my heart is in perfect condition and send me on my way one time they said it might be caused by heart burn and to take over the counter meds for it it helped the heart burn but not the chest pain never thought it might be connected to my anxiety or depression before hmm,1
i have talked to my dr about ect and i have as i said researched it - and roughly 60% of the information/cases im finding where people who have had it have actually reported how they are doing months/years afterwards have shown substantial long term effects from this treatment they report a euphoria type effect after treatments that can last maybe 6 months after which their depression goes back to how it was or its worse + they suffer deficits they never reported having before there is also evidence that hospitals/dr who administer this treatment do not keep records of following up with the patients whove completed their ect sessions longer than 60days approximate the risk factor for this treatment at least to me far far far outweighs any possible benefit,0
benedryl i also keep on hand for anxiety attacks,1
im fearful of my future mostly due to my inability to work (due to mental illness) and lack of money and social connections i feel so lonely just reaching out i know its a shot in the dark,0
yes--a psychiatrist there are excellent treatments for anxiety and depression now hearing voices can be many things: psychosis due to your severe depression and anxiety or a dissociative disorder stemming from some trauma this is something that may require some hard therapy but the help is out there!,1
im on medicine but im horrible at taking it but i do notice a huge difference when im doing good and im on it it makes me feel soo much better,0
i face the fear and do it anyway,0
i get intense deep muscle aches all the time its not in my head either its the worst part of my anxiety disorder i have over the counter wrist braces for when my fingers burn and those help i use a lot of icy hot and that helps for a bit as well i reluctantly take aspirin but it does help a bit too those are the only things i can do anymore myself i hope this helps you a bit its not in your head an it may not even be the medication depression/anxiety does take a physical toll or as i had one doctor explain to me "all pain is biologically in your head pain is real",1
unfortunately there are some idiot therapists took me years to find the right fit you mustnt give up if you are feeling severe anxiety please go to the emergency ward at the closest hospital tell that you have had suicidal thoughts and feel overwhelmed and unsafe they will admit you even if its overnight usually a psychiatric nurse or doctor will assess you and give you out patient information stay safe hugs,1
i suffered for years with an extremely low mood and had tried to kill myself on more than one occasion my thyroid was also out of range and despite supplements etc i ended up having my thyroid removed 2 years ago i now take thyroxine daily along with my meds for depression and anxiety the difference this has made to my low mood is dramatic dont get me wrong i still suffer with bouts of low mood but they are not as bad and are not all the time anymore please do not underestimate what a malfunctioning thyroid can do to your depression as the thyroid regulates an awful lot in your body stay strong and safe xx,1
sorry i dony understand anxiety,0
stress ball maybe,0
this is all ive got i had to go to a 3 day convention put on by my company i was afraid of having a meltdown so i pretended that i knew what i was doing and saying as long as i stayed in the state of "pretending" to do my job it worked it separated me from my fear of imploding i dont imagine it will help you but its all i have,0
you have been given some very good advice by others already ill just say its very normal to feel anxious on your return to your home with time it will pass as you slowly get back into the positive aspects of your day to day life style dont put too much pressure on yourself your only home take your time try to get some fresh air each day its very easy to fall into a pattern of withdrawing from life due to the anxiety personally i wish you well just dont put pressure on yourself immediately baby steps work okay regards,0
has he seen a psychologist for some talk therapy? they can help work out why he is anxious and give him strategies to deal with it medication may help but i would say that most meds havent been tested as safe for kids i do know that ssris made my anxiety worse,1
ive said this a thousand times before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor youll never understand the way the person feels ive lost so many sooo many ppl in my life cuz of my disorders over time my heart has hardened although i try to love n connect with ppl you cant see it so to some it isnt real or a cop out nobody wants this or asks for this you have to be you n if they cant except you for you then you dont need them as much as it hurts you have to put yourself first be open n honest n blunt tell them how you feel n if they cant respect that then you need to move on never be ashamed of who you are n have the strength to stand up for yourself there are plenty of ppl who will support you n remember you are not alone hope this helps n although we dont know ea ch other i am allways here for those who struggle with mental illness,0
i know i have the same problem and has been said sometimes i win and sometimes the depression wins its a real struggle,0
i take 600mg every night it stuffs my nose like fucking crazy the important thing is to take it right before you go to bed and dont stay up late or youll be half dead in the morning (energy wise) sometimes my blood pressure drops when i stand to walk and ill get insanely dizzy have to sit back down i tried going off it a couple times doing so made me highly sensitive to lights i find it more therapeutic taking it than not taking iti cant sleep without it which sets off mania im bipolar 1 with ultra rapid cycling,1
exposure therapy is the way to tackle it take someone with you wholl hold your hand and then baby steps out that door practice deep breathing exercises out there get yourself calm then a few more steps do a bit more with each day or do it morning and again in the afternoon its like a fear of flying the only way is to fly and repeat flying loses the fear exposure therapy dear,0
lmao dear lord i have never heard of a gay man call themselves a homo lmao he isnt the jealous type and isnt worried but thankyou,0
i believe it can be genetic it also can have nothing to do with genes genes only make part of your brain and generally how it works some of it is highly affected by the outer world and circumstances i know my father was likely bipolar and had a lot of the other diagnosis i have my mother has chronic situational depression (its easily triggered and close to being clinical she just doesnt talk about shit so i think if she did it would be considered clinical) my brother has severe anxiety and ocd and depression can be easily triggered for him i know later down our family line we likely have far more mental illnesses that arent mentioned at all but i know because i leaned so strongly towards my bipolar genes that i showed symptoms around 9 and got diagnosed officially at 13 which is practically unheard of (especially 12 years back) but it was obvious what the signs were most children under 16 arent ever diagnosed i was diagnosed at 11 with depression and put on useless (for me) and low dose anti-depressants at nine i was showing symptoms but easily lied about it and covered it up i have been doing ever since its become a habit and people ask me why i do it? and its like i dont remember how not to? so it honestly depends sometimes we are just dealt crap hands sometimes its passed down but its always hell and it makes us stronger than anyone can ever understand,0
shakir thomas babe look ! write that down write that down *in my spongebob voice ❤️,1
this may sound a little off beat and i may not be right but i know from personal experience of having done suicide attempts i never told anybody about it i just did it unsuccessfully i might add because im still here at least hes telling you when he feels that way which is normally a cry for help maybe they need to try different medications its hard to be a guinea pig and find the right ones is he interested in counseling or group therapy do you have enough influence on him to get him to try these things maybe even suggest to him that he was not able to stay strong for himself at least try to stay strong for his children because if he actually did try to commit suicide and died just not he that hes hurting its the whole family and i bet you that your children would never be able get over an event like that sometimes even children feel guilty and think that its their fault because of what their parent has done your children need to be spared from those feelings try and see if you can get him reengage with some talk therapy and be positive that they can find a medication that works for him,0
christy seegmiller i feel like you have been where im currently at i finally broke down and went to a psychologist for proper diagnoses after hundreds of questions and an iq test the psychologist told me he thinks my social anxiety brings on add/adhd symptoms ive never heard of that until now he wants to do one more test that puts me in real life situations and see how i react because my alertiveness/attentiveness came back fine on the iq test have you dealt with any of this?,0
julie ann bergen i have bipolar 1 ptsd i been doing unbelievable well on: risperdal minipress (similar to propanolol blood pressure med but works on anxiety/flashbacks) and lamictal (mood stabilizer) i used to wake up in severe panic attacks each morning and would have severe prolonged manic episodes a few weeks into these meds and the anxiety and mania are gone  good luck it may also be helpful to you to look into joining dbsa (depression bipolar society alliance) and attending meetings,1
i have not been diagnosed with bipolar but this post really got my attention sounds like me and i worry when i cant control it can i ask what your first symptom to get you the bipolar diagnosis people can be addicted to sex but i too am curious of peoples thoughts on this post,0
so much going on in personal relationships financial situation feelings of " theyd be better off without me to worry about" how do you deal the best way for someone to heal who is youre nearest & dearest and your last reason for being alive without destroying their future:? :( ,0
welbutrine gave me panic attacks but we are all wired different,1
you prove you are a strong person because you are here to share this story with us we all are stronger than "normal" people because each day is another day where they might find stressful its double for us never doubt your problems are too petty to talk to someone aboutwe are all importantand we are all strong even in our weakest moments stay strong and you indeed are not alone in this battle daily❤,0
i find my bipolar 2 is kind of cyclical i can be very high functioning or unable to cope at all did the student/job/kids/exercise for a couple of years and then after a life change shifted back into bad habits and then a depressive episode where i cant cope again just take it easy on yourself the transition from student to employee might of set you off so practice as much self care and eliminate as much stress as you can im pregnant so was going off of work this year anyway and could use that as an excuse with my employer and keep my good reference without that circumstance though i would have chosen to focus on another area of my life to cut out some stress you made it through school! you will transition and have a great career once you get through this depressive part of your cycle!,1
i get severe panic attacs and my depression gets worse when i dont take it,1
in addition to the requip for restless legs at bedtime i take 3 capsules of l-tryptophan i also take gaba to calm & relax me usually i take it with my l-tryptophan before bed however anytime i can take the gaba instead of my xanax i do your body produces gaba but some people benefit from also taking a gaba supplement it has no chance of addiction and its easier on your body i buy these 2 supplements from "thorne research" you can find them online their magnesium is superior to any i have taken hope this helps,1
wellbutrin is actually really bad for you its in the same category as neurontin and lyrica horrible horrible drugs,0
man dont i know that feeling too well been there twice sending positive vibes sweetie the staff are very supportive if youre feeling any sorts of anxiety bout the whole scenario i had a meltdown on two nurses & they managed to calm me down,0
ive applied for a position teaching online after i resigned my position in the classroom bc of my anxiety this job could be good or it could feed my bad habits at least i have to be presentable from the neck up for skype conversations so shower and hair done pants would be optional ,0
ive done this before id get manic be hyper active going out etc but wouldnt feel up to socializing with those i cared about most - for various reasons you are a true friend to stick it out through the highs and lows but also remember being a good friend doesnt mean you have to feel you bear any responsibility for his well being sounds as if he hasnt made the leap to medications yet there will be times when the friendship feels heavy and one sided if you need some time so you dont feel burnt out take it it will help reaffirm your friendship it took me until my 30s to get stable i was a huge flake due to my anxiety and depressive episodes and then everyone would think i was crazy when i was manic and avoid me so i avoided them instead,0
dont give up keeping testing the right med combo for you keep working we have to work hard to identify our triggers and we learn a new one daily also i wanted to add a warningif your bipolar and your doctor advise anti depressants rather then anti anxiety find a new doc people anti depressants (for most) bipolar souls only increases depression and intensify anxiety the good doctors know this and keep up with the ever changing discovers in the brain thats the one you want to keep note disclaimer although it is my experience and the experience of many of the people i have met to have had adverse effects with anti depressants mostly paxil and prozac they may be beneficial for some listen to your doc find your zen when the dark creeps in music art writing coloring reading a book playing with you pet anything that you can put your hands on and zen out on,1
everyone reacts differently i didnt get acne with prozac but i did have excessive hunger and increased irritability and hostility,0
i use seroquel for bipolar one and anxiety its s great feud but careful with ur weight ,1
i used to self harm for many years and looked online at the time for online support groups which helped i also got over cutting slowly through the help of a very good friend who taught me to write my pain away through journals and poetry id never written poetry until then aged 35 they were deep and dark i started posting them on various self harm forums and it really helped im now 46 and last time i cut i was 40 and had been doing it since i was 14 apart from seeking medical help please keep what i called a self care box at hand new fresh clean razor antiseptic wipes butterfly stiches ect it keeps you safe i learned that after a wound of mine got badly infected so is very important! i personally learned i used to cut to forget the pain but in a vicious circle every scar reminded me daily of all the parts of life i was desperate to forget instead of escaping my past each scar is permanent reminderbut i can only see that now i have stopped i hope this helps xxx,1
i wouldnt risk it! some antidepressants magnify the effects of alcohol so even one drink can feel like a lot more,0
since you are having problems she might be genetically inclined toward depression but she also has to deal with living with your problems she definitely needs help with that maybe not a hospital but she does need some help its hard enough being a teenager but being a teenager with a depressed parent? it can feel hopeless and miserable she might not need medications; she might just need a mentor who isnt depressed if you cant meet her needs it would be the kind thing to do to find someone who can meet her need to talk things through and find a way to continue towards maturity,1
i am tired i love my kids i love my grandkids but im tired tired of fighting its a losing battle everyday is a struggle scared who you going to piss off scared to open your mouth scared of what somebody might say about you its a losing battle im so tired of it all,0
i find something positive to dwell on exercise faith etc i have stopped telling myself that i am going to feel "bad" and this in itself has helped tremendously you will be what you think you are sick sad etc this is not to downplay anyone on medsjust saying reading all these posts will depress anyone,0
we are afraid to loose what little we have control over maybe just guessing,0
bipolar sucks i never sleep always feel low and useless then once i am on an up i can be crazy and silly for weeks its the drops in depression i cant cope with ive been in p3 twice and its horrid all they want to do is drug you up instead of listening ,0
i take effexor wellbutrin epival and seroquel bp2 and anxiety disorder,1
i have the same problem here i have anxiety and depression and i think i look for reasons to yell to help me cope better which is totally not fair to my 4 kids my kids are good i just get easily frustrated cuz my hubby can tone them out and i hear every little noise they make they argue with each other and they all think theyre the boss of each other tattling every 3 minutes it seems like i never get a moment to think i just want to scream so i do for silly things mostly i havent gone to a dr in a while cuz i dont want there criticism i guess im more ashamed of myself and when i talk about it it really hits home base and than the depression kicks in than im a mess its not a fun disorder and many dont understand,0
i agree with jennifer tenhagen i feel for this man because im in the same boat years now ive pushed people away because i felt unworthy and i can tell you now pressuring him will make him push more and piss him off he needs time to breathe and think and focus on his health if he doesnt want visitors right now respect that ive had people try to talk to me pressure me force me out the house it just makes me mad all the questions and them annoying me i just want to be alone in the silence for a bit hell come to you if and when hes ready,0
i did took too many risks but not now settled and got kids so i can control that side i kinda just relive myself and then feel guilty,0
hi suffered 2 years with the exact same thing the dr told me i had gad its takes time  i didnt take any meds i was to scared  time healed me,1
i went through the same thing i was devastated because in my head (no offense to anyone on this page or anywhere meant) it meant it was worse than previously thought and i had found such comfort in being able to justify it as "only type 2" however when i am on a medication regime as well as therapy regime that works for me along with healthy eating and exercise (as much as i can bc i have cerebral palsy) it is easier to navigate lets say not always deal with but navigate i have no doubt youll be able to as well with the right tools ask for help take care of yourself the best you can and be honest with doctors (that last one used to be hard for me bc i was so scared of my symptoms) much luck to you ❤️,1
i disagree 7 is not to young my kids are amazing 161310 7 and they have always understood i have mental disorders in fact they are always there always understanding and have been the only ones in my life who are they dont take it personally when im irritable and yes i do try not to let that affect them,0
i overthink all the time i analyze everything sometimes i really believe that when i overthink everything i become my own worst enemy as much as we want to "turn the brain off" it isnt an easy thing to do at all i have tried many times but failed at it i also understand the shower thing last week i hadnt showered or changed my clothes in 9days and that included brushing my hair im not proud of this fact but it happens my own smell finally became too much to handle and i showered the funny thing is after the shower i felt amazing being in the shower felt amazing but the hardest part in those 9days was getting myself to the shower!! depression/bi polar sucks! after 13yrs of marriage i just found out a couple of days ago that my husband is cheating with some woman well its been a few women online and now my marriage is over i dont doubt my depression helped push him to someone else as on my lowest days i must have been so hard to deal with and unless your partner understands depression or has been around it or has a family member suffering from it they have no idea how to handle our highs and lows the mood swings are out of control sometimes and if i can barely cope with how i am feeling how do i expect him or anyone else to understand what it is like?? life is crappy my future is crappy and all men are lying cheating pigs but hey thats life!!!! just because everyone else is hard on you dont be hard on yourself!!! ♥,0
by the way laugh away! i am very aware of depression and anxiety illness,1
trouble swallowing restless legs weight gain tremors it worked great for my mood and sleep but the side effects were too much for me to handle,1
im on it for anxiety and depression she is hoping it helps stabilize my moods bc im bipolar as well i took it for the first time last night idk if it was just my anxiety about taking it but my chest hurt and i didnt sleep good at all! all these side effects scare me bc i have two young children an 18 month old and a 2 month old i dont wanna be irritable or saddened even more i have to take care of my babies what if i dont notice myself change? im doing it alone so i dont have anyone to tell me if im being extra cranky or if im snapping i dont wanna snap on my kids or go through withdrawals,1
this is offensive to people who already struggle with self-defeating thoughts this contributes to the stigma you say you are trying to fight,0
i have pretty bad anxiety attacks at night sometimes sometimes thats how i know im manic,0
i take wellbutrin with the cymbalta it helps with the anxiety but like most have said everyone is different it may be something to ask about,1
youre not alone tips which have worked wonders for me: green tea 3 times a day daily yoga or other exercise supplements such as omega 3 d and methylfolate corrections to diet! cutting out garbage sugar processed and fake foods and eating as organic and whole as possible obviously not a guarantee or a quick fix but most people would be surprised to find how immensely proper physical health can aid in easing symptoms of mental health struggles,0
i live for love the love that i have for others the love they have for me; i live for the love i have at hearing the birds sing in the early mornings and i live for the love of walking among the trees and just being sure i suffer from the maddening depression and the loneliness that consumes me i fear the people i see around me and the stress and anxiety that overwhelms me but through all of the suck in life i choose to live for the fleeting moments of love,0
you have done the right thing and she will understand in time when she is on the correct meds bless you and your family its a battle but stick together and you will cope xx above all talk to anyone you can and dont be afraid of taking help and advise much love to you xx,0
same with me jennifer davis! any change in my regular routine causes me to forget my pills i also dont wake up at the same time everyday and also same as you with medications for other problems some meds i have to take on an empty stomach some with food some pills i have to take 2 and 4 hours after or before a different pill it can get very confusing very quickly! ~dani,1
its out there you will find the one it just takes the right person i was married for almost 9 years i loved her in the beginning but i had suspensions that shut my feelings off the hardest thing i ever did was not fallow my manic urges till the end i always thought she was cheating turns out she was sent me in to a uncontrollable manic state real quick then a deep depression im still stuck in now we been separated almost 2 years and divorced just over a year now she still my friend but i have to be careful because she now how to use me against me the good news is some how in the last year i have stumbled across a wonderful women that has the patience of a saint and a heart of gold she has not push anything and lets me do me she has helped me heal and grow i know realise i am going to be ok with proper support we decide to start merging our families in to one big family and moved in together she has showed me its ok to love again i call her my sunshine because she is the only person that can brighten my day with just a smile im scared to admit it to her but i have fallen in love a love that i have never felt before a love that scares the holy hell out of me she always tells me "its ok al we dont need to rush i love you and i am here and will always be here your mine and i aint letting you go again",0
if your withdrawing off all of these at the same time them you are going to be in for a hard time its not going to be pleasant and that is speaking from experience i would recommend withdrawing in a facility where you can be monitored as i have anxiety depression ptsd ocd bipolar 1 boardline personality disorder eatly onset psychosis as well as chronic pain fibromyalgia and ive done the withdrawl process in order to change meds and when i wanted to have my son but in all honesty its not going to be pretty please dont do it alone,0
you have so much life to live there are so many different treatments and things you could be doing to help cope with the anxiety im honestly appalled the doctor would suggest it  have you seen a psychiatrist?,0
i take it 3 times a day and yes it does tend to make me sleepy but most the time its better to take it and be sedated to a point then dealing with the irritability and mania that i have without it,1
i know its not the symbol for it but ive got a koi fish swimming upstream to remind me of the never ending struggles i face being bipolar and im working on getting a phoenix bc im rising from the ashes of my struggles and moving forward,0
i have a major deal of it for almost 40 years if you leave him isolated he will go nuts and may do the wrong choice isolating i have done it is like being in your own jail!: ((( its horrible,0

spend outdoor activities with your close friends that boost your self esteem and dont overthink about anything because it can cause anxiety and depression  just think positive always and take your meds,1
3years ago i was where you are feeling same feelings i couldnt even get out of bed my mom had home care and her nurses were like family they gave me 24hours to make the decision to commit my self or they were going to do it for me i spent 30days in the psych unit and i started at the beginning of what i thought was wrong and i was shown what was really wrong please dont give up some how you arent finding the right person/dr whomever it took me 11years and i am learning how to live with me again one day at a time i have manic depressive and bipolar with social anxiety disorder depression and bipolar are 2seperate things that need to be treated differently not all jumbled together you are not alone,0
my personal experience get ready to be a guinea pig it took decades n numerous doctors to find a combo of six different medications that keep me stable n it takes weeks to see any affect but i suffer from three different diagnosis my point is yes it can get better im way better on medications than without but its a long road of trials be open n honest with your doctor tell them everything even if its small or embarrassing its the only way to get results,1
ryan i have been on anti-anxiety and anti-depressants for many years they have made all the difference in the world for me i explained my symptoms to my doctor and she gave me a prescription so much better than being so anxious i would get panic attacks in restaurants because of all the people around me,0
you need help call for help dont feel guilty just do it and live your life protect your self and him call for help,1
dont worry hes not the craigslist killer,0
you might have to start on a smaller dose of seroquel the lowest dose is 25 i only take a small dose but it is helpful along with my other medications which includes prozac for depression anxiety and ocd and a good amount of mood stabilizers for my bipolar disorder,1
if they only knew what really goes on in ones mind!! everyday i struggle!!,0
every doc ive been to has asked about that i knew at times my drive was over the top but i wouldve never connected it to my illness i actually had to have a doc sit down and explain it to me before i accepted it now when im even partially manic i refuse to have sex even if im in a committed relationship i find myself to get irritated when they dont scratch the itch that tends to never go away so to prevent an argument i just keep my legs closed until i know im level again the depressed episode has an affect on my sex drive as well if i fall too low just for someone to touch me pisses my soul off to the point where ill go sleep on the couch because just wrapping his arm around me tends to irritate me,0
yes i agree that it is about support for everyone involved i too have multiple diagnoses: depression anxiety bipolar and borderline personality disorder i am in multiple support groups 4 mental illnesses and a lot of times i see people who post dont have much support from the people they know personally such as myself and this way its like a third person and if we dont judge each other we are able to give ideas to help one another i can see how having things group together can be somewhat confusing but it works for a lot of people,1
being scared is totally normal its because you dont have the safety and security of others around both professional and other patients on the unit,0
í take vengador two in the morning clonzepam for anxiety three times a day as needed and buspiron twice a day but been told they want to take clonazepam off for good to all persons,0
please please dont give up dont let this awful illness beat you so many questions which you dont have answers for we need logic in our lives to make any sense of the world and ourselves but mental illness doesnt often make logical sense eg we can often feel alone but push people away etc i guess i would need to ask lots of questions to help you answer some of yours but i think our minds are such a complex organ and just like others in our bodies it sometimes doesnt work as we want it to and sometimes it cant cope at certain times in our lives some people need help im not sure whether you are receiving or have had any support from family or professionals or have help in the form of medication therapy etc i remember at my lowest points i felt my head was constantly on fire its exhausting (no wonder you feel always tired) and escape from our thoughts can feel so welcome impossible and/or necessary you say you ve struggled for four years thats one of the worst things that it can go on for so long and feel as though it can take forever to get better i felt it wasnt living only existing not a life why? a 64 million dollar question the answer; probably due to hundreds of small things and quite possibly made worse by some notable bigger things im sure study could have been really hard the discipline and energy needed may well have taken its toll but once it was over your life changed possibly exciting in one way but scary in another as your secured your job i dont like to second guess as i dont know but just trying to look at possible triggers and difficulties beginning a new stage of life must have been challenging why anyone has anxiety or depression at any point in their life if only we knew but the important thing is how to get better from here plans are great goals are good but they can also seem insurmountable too big on good days we might feel we can conquer the world and make wonderful plans on bad days getting out of bed is a step too far plans i think are definitely a good idea but they also need to include smaller achievable but significant goals do your friends understand? are they supportive? yes always anxious sounds familiar when we struggle it can be one long round of constant anxiety as you arent well it makes sense if you arent at peace with yourself or content i believe we all ultimately want to get better to escape the quagmire of self pity and crap we are in but its to find that way forward one step at a time dont lose sight of those plans but also it is necessary to be realistic and accept that it isnt going to be easy hold onto the hope that it can get better lean on those you love tell them how you feel and let them help you life can get better take good care be kind to yourself you deserve a better life x,0
my fear is that i will no longer be the person i once was,0
i have bipolar 2 and adhd i struggled along most of my life with nothing until 8 years ago then i was put on the right medication and it has helped me so very much,1

i saw where people are upset because the bushings may fall out when you put it in your mouth,0
talk to a therapist about your abandonment issues and separation anxiety its not easy feeling that way and maybe you can find some hobbies you like as well painting drawing video games biking hiking coloring anything really it truly helps when you work hard at staying busy,1
every good thing takes time i know how it feels like to stay at hospital i used to get ect once every 2 days but finally im here still alive still breathing still fighting against the voices still struggling just because youre struggling doesnt mean youre failing lets fight this voices together let it flow but dont give up never lose hope ive been there and i survived so will you,0
yes the saddest part is that while things were good i fell in love with my now husband im not doing well anymore and the poor guy is stuck with me i cant stand to be around me and he tries really hard to understand my mood swings and need to be left alone but unless youve been were we go mentally you cant understand i feel so bad for him! he never would cheat doesnt mean i dont worry that he should find someone that could gives him what i cant he deserve to be happy you know? and i cant be that !,0
it isim at the back end of a psychotic manic episode that lasted 9 daysnot 1 hour sleep for 6 days and last night i finally got 4 hours and i can feel im coming down at lastthe 2 things i normally do when manic i tried to avoid doing but failed to stop doing 1 of them and at least i wont hear no more damn voices or see shadow figures moving aboutpeople always think mania is some exciting thing where everything is greatwish they could understand that theres a lot of shit too,0
theres free apps for android and iphone that have muscle relaxation exercises and breathing exercises i use it for my anxiety and once i get more calm its easier for me to fall asleep i use pacifica but that could be considered more for mental health than just purely sleep i also invested in a sound machine with a lot of options and i do a nightly routine i have sleep apnea so i use a cpap as well but the breathing exercises meditations sound machine and routines helped me immensely,1
i forget all the damn time im horrible at taking meds,0
maybe if you know youre getting anxious and depressed about itslow down and focus on just you and i dont mean masturbation either breathing exercisesmeditate read books cook food you love try to not be sexual it may help you figure out why you feel this way just an idea feel better,0
hi first believe without a doubt that you will be better talk to yourself daily say i am getting better repeatedly eat healthy food drink more water and exercise hope you get better soon,0
its not that easy and you add to the stigma by saying stuff like this many folks dont get the proper help and struggle to accept they need meds please dont make it harder on fellow sick folks,0
alarm or pill box,0
that is so true my daughter goes through this and its very hard to watch and understand but if people would take the time and learn about how to help and handle the struggles of the people who have to struggle with this illnesses you are correct if it was cancer or something you could see then it is acceptable so unfair for everyone,0

taking a break is important also when you feel up to it research mindfulness it has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety it takes practice but it is well worth it,1
i flush mine down the toilet then cry about how miserable my life is then im happy 5 mins later lol,0
putting techno on open curtains and if u cant get out of bed tell a friend ur still in bed at 2pm and they will make u get out of bed ! haha then start with yoga because it doesnt seem like a workout after excersis catches ur interest again  get a membership at planet fitness for $10 if ur more serious got to 24 hr get involved in fun classes like spin arobics  swimming ect it helps with my agression and irritability bienging is hard to stop i would say get a protien shake u will be full more and not need to eat as much i recommend protien worlds slender blender shakes good luck!,0

i think i know how you feel you dont want to worry your mom but you need some support thats what these pages are for there are lots of fellow sufferers out there that can relate to your situation i know you like to rely on your mom but from what youve said she seems to have enough worries of her own at the moment do you have any self help techniques that you can practice? do you meditate? also wondering if you have a good therapist ive been struggling badly myself but im doing ok lately i hope you can find a way through your difficulties,0
and actually mean it but i know im hard to love so i guess i shouldnt be upset about it,0

i personally had a horrible reaction to latuda doctor stopped it immediately and started me on seroquel xr,1
i just need to say that whether you agree or disagree with this post that is no need to put someone down for fucks sake we are all dealing with depression anxiety or other mental disorders and the ones putting other people down are probably why i understand you need to get happiness any way you can but if it means being a pompous ass then you have worse problems to deal with anyone should be able to ask anything without being made feel like they are stupid or crazy,0
go to your doctor be honest and stay on your meds id be afraid to go off mine i already have the slight over spending problems every time you go off of them the harder to readjust do the right thing stay on your meds!,1

i totally relate to this sounds like youre talking right out of my head!!! i cant shake this horrible tired i was tired constantly before i started the meds n they started me at 25 mg of limictal after the first 11 days on that dose i was gtg then they doubled that n i am on now 50 mgs and i hate this feeling!!! i have had a headache seriously since i started the medication i feel more anxious and far more down than before i was medicated from what i can tell from other people this is part of your body adjusting to it i am told to keep trying it but the goal is to get me up to 200mgs and i already want to die at just 50mgs ugh keep at it talk to your prescriber and try to remember that this is just a phase and that it will balance out at some point :( sorry im not more help n dont have answers but you are defiantly not alone in the way youre feeling :(,0
i had a stroke in 2014 because i took myself off my meds have a care talk to your doctor right away call his service now do not resume until you have spoken to him if you have muscle twitching and trouble speaking call an ambulance do not hesitate call your doc,1
listen to me there is no fucking shame in getting medical help medicine is good for you it can help you and it can help prevent another break down therapy can help but if you wont break your pride to try then youre on your own naturally being wise enough to get help is the best way to go think before you act,1
brooke l morgan my advice would be to keep a daily journal of mood sleep irritability  and anxiety symptoms,1
sue youre exactly right this is why i say read up and get knowledge! jay and eric both need more knowledge on this thc is a good pain releaver and is proven weed is proven to cause anxiety paranoia and depression get your facts correct and until you both show me evidence from a source stop giving advice obviously you both know nothing about!,1
hey sweetie we have all been where you are dont just suffer i have had bi-polar my entire life the med change is an uncomfortable roller coaster but its worth it youll feel better so go to your dr and feel better soon hugs & prayers,0

i exercise hard now instead but no for me my self harm (cutting and burning) was cathartic it was the only way i knew to reset my brain when it got overloaded with negative thoughts or i get stuck in my analytical loop it was how i started breathing again mine was also hidden on parts of the body that werent seenso yeah defo not for attentionbut i find working out or doing yoga actually helps the burn in my muscles helps in the same way :) but im not bipolar i suffer major depression and anxiety,1
we arent alone although it feels that way because when suffering from this you can be with 1000 other people and it just doesnt matter im not afraid to admit it its not a flaw of character its a disease facebook is an outlet to purge the "shit" if you cant del with that unfriend me if you havent already lets see how many true friends that im left with;;;;;;;;;;;;,0
yes the lack of support systems like "family" comes with hand in hand with the illness  ignorance really plus a strong fear of "it couldnt happen to me"  you knuckheads  jaja,0
it will take awhile for me been depressed and anxiety-filled for about 25 years now im trying to deal with the death of my 34 year old younger brother had a wife and 2 kids so sad!!,1
i would say the cube would probably work better i have really bad social anxiety and the fidget spinners doesnt appeal to me at all would only bring more attention to myself aswell they seem more of a kids toy to me,1
didnt do much for meall it did was make me really hungry at night time enough to disturb my sleep + gained a ton of weight from it & worsened my depression,1
cody cassidy this this is what its like before i go into depression or anxiety,1
thx ronnie! ive just got a lot on my plate my son was shot in 2007 (he survived thank god!) and i got laid off my job cuz i was spending too much time at the hospital depression & anxiety kicked in and i was in pain 24/7 come to find out i have fibromyalgia osteoarthritis and a list of a dozen things wrong  i need teeth lolyou gotta laughor cry and cant afford shit on disability im trying to be positive and happy but its a daily challenge just some background im trying and focusing on being thankful for the good,0
its a daily struggle for me to contain my bitchiness,0
im glad im not the only one it really triggers my anxiety too im a hot mess lol lots of love to you ladies ❤,0
i had a miniature poodle who knew when i was struggling and would be there for me now we have cats and one of them is very clingy with me he sits outside my bedroom at night waiting for me to wake up and hell come in for cuddles the minute i sit in the lounge room he jumps up and wont leave me be most of the time i appreciate it lol animals can pick up on moods emotions and illness they are very special like that,0
insomnia is common for those of us with mental illnesses the anxiety well any time you dont have something distracting you the panic sets in talk to your doctor about lack off sleep can make your illness worse,1
you just do! but before that before i turned 28 i struggled a lot! after i turned 28 i learned how to control it a little more easier! dont get me wrong i still deal with it! just not as bad prior!,0
i saw my family members grow up with this disorder it a major stuggle and was hard to communicate with them my dad had bipolar and was an alcoholic hes passed on but thinking back i feel so bad that he grew up in a day and age where these problems werent protrudingly aware as they are today i have experience horrid past events and i can tell you those problems you can get over with the right talk therapy i also heard exercise can help i know you posses bouts of excessive energy with bp so if you can take up walking jigging running to burn some of it off i think one of the main things is to try an catch yourself when you go into mania im not sure if you have control over thattry to just keep telling yourself its the illness then maybe lift weights or jog you definable need to control the depression part how is your job status? working hard with good pay does much for the self-esteem hang in there,0
me too it stopped the shakes and heart racing at first but i found it didnt work as well later on it doesnt do anything for the brain whir ive been told now to just take it as needed,1
marilyn corrado ah yes i can see the symptoms now apologies for that i guess too you are in the us and im in the uk so unfortunately services and provision are different there it sounds to me you are a brilliantly supportive and insightful mum im sure your son knows how lucky he is to have your continued support i know with mine he relies so heavily on me which as you describe can feel as though you are doing everything in your power for him but on the flip side it can feel such a weight a pressure to make everything ok it can seem as though you have to fight so hard for everything to get him into the best school for his needs didnt sound easy but you did it and it probably good for him in many ways but clearly he is struggling with the whole idea of being around like minded people that is one of the most difficult areas i really struggled with the whole issue of how to sell the idea of having a mental illness to my son his problems started at the age of ten and i didnt want to label him i didnt want him to be defined by it to think that this was how it was always going to be like you i wanted it to be talked about no secrets or white lies as such but i also wanted to give him hope that it wouldnt be like this forever even though of course i had no proof of that its all so difficult and sometimes as parents we have to make these constant difficult decisions we have no handbook how do we know what to do and say for the best? all we can do is try our best for him to not want to engage or socialise with the others does sound understandable he wants to feel normal he wants to be a normal teenager in a way i didnt really want to take him to workshops or courses for mental illness as it seemed to me that i would be confirming that this was to be his life it is a really hard thing to know whats for the best sometimes but sometimes it is only those who suffer who truly understand its got to be the right person i suppose for him to relate to and to feel an affinity with its not easy yes peer support and meeting others in similar situations can really help sometimes are there any charities which have meetings? although of course these might not be able to access if your son feels particularly anxious does he engage with understanding people through social media would you know? this seems to be the most common means nowadays it must be difficult for you when you have other children as well do you have avenues to be able to do things for you and people to support you? unfortunately as frustrating it is we cant just fix them my son who is also 17 has had very bad long periods of suffering anxiety but he is slowly moving forwards has recently secured a job and is starting to build a better life he is far from cured of course and lives quite an insular life but there is hope and im sure you will get there but depression as a result of acute anxiety is a real possibility and a challenge to ideally avoid or if not treat xx,0
whats helping me is getting in some exercise i walk/jog 30+ minutes a day i also have pets which are my emotional support animals talk therapy helps me too i was in your place a few years ago i quit taking my meds and everything spun off course its not shameful to need meds my body has a chemical imbalance if i had diabetes id take my insulin please be open to trying all of the above if you try everything and its still not better you may have a chemical imbalance like i do please keep talking youre doing the important first step ,1
medications work differently for different people ive had to change 3-4 times now and finally wellbutrin works for me in the day and 1/2 a xanax at night i didnt like the way seroquel as it took longer to kick in and id fall asleep late and wake up late feeling like a zombie i even started getting night terrors i work weekly with a therapist and just started group dbt therapy one thing i can tell you that has worked very well for me is volinteering im around other people who care about others and the people you help are appreciative which makes me feel better about myself good luck,1
its not the main reason its just a reason that is a lot easier to hold onto and believe suicidal people dont care about themselves anymore but more often than not they still care deeply about their family it could be why they bottled up all their feelings and let it get to that point because they didnt want to worry anyone oh and this is someones life were talking about if guilt tripping keeps someone alive until they can find a better reason to stay alive thats a success in my book,0
are you being medication compliant? do you have a rescue plan for anxiety attacks?,1
this zee person obviously doesnt know a single thing about the reason/origin of the causes of the various conditions of the mind they are extremely complex in origin and after all the centuries of medical investigations and expertise the medical professionals can still only hazard a guess and experiment with the thousands of drugs available to try to obtain a combination that works single parenthood??? most certainly not its easy to be judgemental until it strikes you! so i would tread very lightly before another careless word is typed here it could just cause the push over an edge that for some of us is a very narrow one i am bp2 after a severe head injury as a teenager and it changed my entire lifeand has worsened as the years stresses and misfortunes have taken their toll so the stresses and misfortunes caused by the illness exacerbated the condition which caused more impulsive and wrong decisions which led to more stress and misfortune so please be careful what you say to someone words once they leave your mouth cannot be taken back and the effects they can have on many may be an eternal sentence of doom but i forgive you for your comments ignorance is bliss but be warnedyou may need our advice someday,1
personally i didnt react well on it after three days i couldnt stand it made my anxiety skyrocket made me dizzy and nauseous light headed and just generally feel crap,0
i understand sometimes what is said or posted isnt helpful if you have a diagnosis please dont be ashamed as i was god makes us and gives us things to make us stronger if you are on meds take them faithfully maybe this is your test in trust and faith,0
this is true i currently am one whenever someone says it it makes me feel guilty and a lot worse we all know they would miss you but what ppl think when their suicidal is i have no life thats whats important to focus on and this says just that,0
i felt the same way after my discharge i was disoriented and not sure of myself it will pass i did hop/iop afterward and it helped you can always call the crisis line if you need to talk to someone to help when its overwhelming,0
cymbalta helps with my anxiety aches n pains and depression i wish you well,1
i feel the same way i just started seeing someone n really fkin afraid that my anxiety n depression would scare her away :(,1
get out of the house too and get in that sunshine even if you dont want to contact them first if you have to even if you dont want to action it helps our worries lonlieness dread feelings of inadequacies  and dislike of self go away i just started taking lithium a month ago im laughing again stay strong and like nike just do it! lol,0
he needs a psychiatrist and a counsellor too but more importantly he needs himself to be less worried about his illness he is not alone there are many like him things gets ok soon or later and if he has you by his side thats enough to get the hell out of this shit,0
i rapid cycle which for me means that i am manic way more often than not during these phases with my hypersexuality its like walking around as an exposed nerve the wind blows and you want it the riskier the better the rougher the better it has destroyed relationships,0
it was horrid i hate it and will never use it again,1
all medication has side effects no matter what u take u have to just think are they worth the side effects for the relief u get i deal with medications all day long an no matter what u take there is a risk anyone who tells u other wise is a lier all drs and chemists will tell u there is no medication available that does not have a side effect of taking it,1
there is no shame in going back to the hospital if your family screams scream back louder until they hear you sending hugs n prayers,0
i found working helped me i had to cope through anxiety attacks in a "safe" environment gaining more confidence and success in dealing with the disorder helps you to manage it better long term ive taken two tours of europe been to mexico and many other trips doing things i never thought i would do anxiety is uncomfortable but it isnt dangerous is what i tell myself also rewired my thinking by studying buddhism in particular ajahn brahms book "dont worry be grumpy" worked better than any kind of medication,1
it doesnt get better but it does get easier easier to accept yourself and to not let it bother you so much dont let this disorder lie in the forefront of your mind either just take your meds and live your life the best you can every day dont worry people worth it will stick with you no matter what youll get to realize what starts that roller coaster as time goes on it doesnt really stop it but gives you time to talk your way through it or take the charge cards and give them to someone else before you run them up on a grand spending spree!!,0
some days can be a struggle,0
i taken ritaline its helps but not for my anxiety that somethimes kicks in,1
praying for and all of us its scary especially when youre not on meds because of financial reasons or they dont believe you!,1
here is my technique- i have 8 boxes with 7 days a piece- the yellow one i pack with morning meds and the blue ones with evening meds (i take about 20 each morning and evening) so once packed i have a month of meds i keep one set on the dining room table (no kids around) and if the correct color is not showing my husband will just say have you taken your meds? i rarely miss my meds with this system i am 60 with bipolar 1 and recently diagnosed anxiety disorder,1
yes it is genetic but can also be triggered i also had trauma and was mis diagnosed with normal depression you dont have to have trauma to have it but that can trigger your bipolar it doesnt mean it will be passed down to your children it can skip generations i was worried about my kids but worry is just part of us anyway im open and honest to my kids about it so they understand it a bit more too hope this helps x,1
usually i get a response and stuff is posted its not usually like that to be avoided but i noticed a change over the weekend too i think admin also have disorders so maybe someone had an emergency,1
i am a navy wife and i understand completely i have ptsd  pd anxiety and bi polar i am the leader of our support groups for wives i got involved by talking to the ombudsman there is support out there for you feel free to contact me in pm and i can try to help you as much as i can ,0
i would recommend to see therapist also maybe change your meds also energy drinks trigger anxiety and depressiondrinking with meds wrosen your simtons  it also think you might have bipolar 3 borderline personality disorder i am not a doctor or specialist​ but i been treated for over 12 years so i seen tons of therapist and take natural meditation as well as western medicineaccupunture works for me massage meditation i also stress levels cause change to your depression  not having a job allows more time to think try to keep busy if you can go for a walk take a bath juice fast my work too you can do 3days coconut oil reduces inflammation in the brain omega too helps the brain function better ginger  like i said this is all the stuff that has worked for me i am not a specialist try talking to a therapist sometimes when you voice the ideas you have in your brain it loses it power writing  pick up a new hobby till you get your job dont worry on the thing you cant control do small progressive thing around the house stuff you can actually control dont rominate about stuff thing eventually work them self out  i had 3 suicide and i was revived from all of them i happy i was i have done a ton of wonderful thing and picked up a ton of hobbies i getting to see my daughter grow up your son needs more then you think you cant replace a parent  one thing at a time  maybe the pressure of becoming a new parent might of triggered your depression but taking your life is not the way out you need to see your son grow i been through 2 divorces and i have survived there been dark times but i kept doing thing until i got better exercise has helped me alot also i wish you luck and i hope i have helped in any way having a mental illness is not the end of your life learn to except it and finding new ways to deal with it like any disease its not the end all your life is just beginning,1
im sorry thats horrible,0
i hope you can talk to your dr about this soon maybe you can get fmla or even better a paid medical leave i had fmla for mental health days once it was in place my boss couldnt give me a hard time about needing to be off or anxiety at work reach out blessings,0
i cant and wont comment on your medications since i am not a doctor relocating searching for work and just being a teacher are stressful enough use the cbt as it best applies to you discuss medications with professionals and your feeling and plans with all friends available attempt to do what you feel is best for you trust your judgment good luck,1
because instead of thinking of your pain you need to think of what it would do to your family and friends if you have kids it changes them in ways youll never see because you wont be there however we all know the struggle,0
ive been diagnosed with literally the same exact things plus panic disorder and was on disability since i was 16 but i lost my disability at age 21 and went almost 4 years without it or even a job because i believed the same thing when you have severe social anxiety and panic attacks randomly you already know theres no way id want to be around hella people and feel so miserable but on the inside im also passionate about living life and having awesome fun precious moments with friends and family and i want what my friends have; a life a life where youre exhausted but because of work not my disability i want to feel stress the kind about college not how im going to survive mentally and physically today or how im going to ask mom for money to pay my phone bill im missing out and ill be 25 on september 2nd im a strong person i just havent tried hard enough which hurts kinda of to say because i believe i do try i try every damn day to wake up and be ok but most of the time my demons stop me and get the best of me but the last 5 months something clicked in april i lost my medical insurance and ive been going all this time without my pills i was on trazadone lamotrigine propranolol etc but ive been staying with my bfs mom and shes been such great help and i realized with a change of environment (for me in my own case not suggesting this works for everyone) ive changed completely a friend is helping me get a part time job and i couldnt be happier or more proud of myself for facing my fears the point of this long comment is that i wish i did what im trying to do now when i was your age because im getting older and now its gonna take me longer to be who i want to be dont make my mistake ive seen people with worst cases of paranoia schizophrenia and be amazing successful people speaking in front of crowds and hallucinating at the same time but pushing it to the side to be able to do their job and youd never guess you can work with ptsd anxiety etc is it going to be easy? no are you gonna mess up have an episode maybe even lose your job? yeah tbh but you get up take care of yourself first and try again i hope you see this as helpful and not judging or a negative comment because i promise its not sorry for long comment lol emma-jane naude,0
it all seems overwhelming there is medicine that helps and its a long journey getting it dialed in even then youll still have failures its about a willingness to get up more times than you fall down everything else is just background noise i drive on dirt roads whenever i can and play my music loud! truth thats how i found my inner-peace just gotta find your dirt road ,1
i feel like have these signs i am worried now that i am a toxic person,0
you have made yourself a victim instead if accepting you have depression or another mental health issue and dealing with the positives as and web they present themselves thus could mean doing something which makes you totally uncomfortable but doing it for your own self esteem and positive mindset i am still on medication i still shut myself away i still shun parties and get togethers but occasionally i bite the bullet and so far by attending because i have made the decision todo so i have not encountered any major breakdowns inwardly i give myself a pat on the back for achievement,0
i would see a psychiatrist for an actual diagnosis as an intake person isnt qualified to do so for treatment of bpd the best form is dbt (dialectical behavior therapy) if you actually do have bpd your psychiatrist can get you in touch with the appropriate therapist to treat you bpd and bipolar disorder are easily confused with one another so a qualified professional diagnosis is best,1
i currently take 10mg diazepam and 200mg of quitiapine as needed for anxiety and depression episodes i have tried many different meds and these seem to work the best please take care and good luck to you,1
what happens in the mind is the most scariest thing ever my mind is truly fucked up,0
sadly im with matthew on this one my daughter has bipolar disorder and i constantly see the crazy irrational anti social angry impulsive hurtful flakey etc etc behaviour no fun for her or me :(,1
this is so true i have been suffering this condition for years finally in the last three i have been stable which is such a blessing it has taken me such a long time to learn and cope with this and not identify myself with it i now know how to get through day to day life without it being such a roller coaster for me im am so glad and grateful that i no longer feel shame for having this mental illness,0
youre under a lot of stress and that will really compound your depression and moods the most "normal" people are greatly affected by these types of situations it would be so good if you could see a psychiatrist because they are much more knowledgeable about these medications you may be able to see a psychiatric nurse practitioner and it would be less expensive just keep breathing sweet pea you will make it!,1
ill go ahead and break my own anonymity by writing my experience above im not trying to say my life is perfect or that i dont have bad times but through med management and positive people and activities and therapy ive found things are much better i still have suicidal thoughts when things get bad but not to the point of obsessing about it any more i still make bad decisions but things are so much better than how they were and i know that no matter how bad it gets that the bad days will pass and i can go back to being content with my life,0
set a alarm or when ur daily show comes on,0
my dr put me on escitalopram for my depression and buspirone for my anxiety from what ive heard buspirone is for anxiety i would double check with your dr but other than that buspirone isnt that great the only way to break out of anxiety is to challenge yourself to talk to a person who youve never met before a day small talk like hi or how your day is going i usually do this when i go to the store and talk a bit with the cashiers when im checking out,0
i have bp and anxiety i have depressive moments and hypomania i dont have long moments of depression it only comes in moments and the unexplained crying outbursts i wouldnt be alive without my meds i just wish there was someone at work i could talk too i feel very alone at work not part of the team ,1
make sure to have blood levels checked if you take lithium mine wasnt being monitored and overdosed for 3months with alot of uncontrollable vomiting,1
its far from selfish hun its just the way youre feeling at the moment and something so small that possibly wouldnt bother you has become more prominent and its upsetting maybe have a little word with your mum as to how its made you feel im sure she didnt want to make you feel this way its good to talk hun xx,0
you will know if you need medication it is a matter of functioning or not functioning for me life or death; however mental illness runs in my family it is genetic for us i have not had the traumatic experiences which cause some people problems such as abuse or fighting in a war i think the cause of the mental illness has a great deal to do with the maintenance of the illness i am not a professional i have had a mental illness since i can recall; i was about 5 years old (depression) and am now 39 (bipolar 1 and ocd) life is a struggle sometimes but i can live a relatively "normal" life it is a personal decision like taking any other medication--for instance if high cholesterol runs in your family diet and exercise may not be enough to put your symptoms and numbers in check in that situation after the other changes have failed to make major alterations you may be prescribed medication by your doctor; however it is your personal decision to take them or not good luck to you and blessings on your journey!,1
bobbi nicole sullivan yes all this for anxiety too much or too little for you?,1
i take lithium lamictal seroquel and prazison but i have bipolar 1 ptsd and anxiety,1
wish my dumb parents would get this thru there head so thru would understand how badly im struggling,0
go youve probably done for everyone else its time to take care of you i was admitted last year after my own struggles it was the best thing i ever did for myself use the opportunity to learn about yourself and let someone take care of you dont let stigmas stop you from getting help you may desperately need,1
the higher the dosethe worse tbe restlegs legs nothing like being exhausted and unable to lay down i was on it for years the extended release version helped the restless legs,1
the worst is when youre the one telling yourself others have it worse so you dont worry about yourself,0
som leder till "riktig" stress,0
thats a lot of things to be dealing with all at once without enough money or enough support it must feel overwhelming you have a lot of responsibilities and things you are trying to solve but you need help im not sure how to help but i think some of it will work out somehow if you have a little patience first one thing will be solved then another until you are in a different situation and state of mind it may not seem possible to solve these problems now because so much is happening at once but things will change it is so great that you rescued two pitbulls that is a wonderful thing for you to do they arent always so lucky to have someone like you helping them keep on helping them and loving your daughter one day at a time the other stuff is less important make sure you are on some good medications that work for you because you need to be stable while going through these challenges,1
didnt realize that i had social anxiety,1
i would advise a reasonable gap between kids to make things easier two small kids at home would be v stressful care plans much better these days an epidural helped me a lot to avoid stress/ pain which was a trigger for me you need to organise help after the baby ie at night if breastfeeding interferes with medication then dont do it i had quetiapine which helped me relax after birth and sleep which is v important ur case may be different as long as you know ur triggers / patterns but it is manageable so dont worry i was v high risk and this worked along with prayer ,1
how ive been feeling but i know im going through it all to make me stronger my heart had melted again for a while so far m afraid of going back to the ice maiden again but i cant control that if it does guess thats just another part of me dying!,0
i was diagnosed when i was 26 with bipolar and now i am 44 as i am getting older my manic episodes have been getting under control and i have been working these past 3 years i was told by my psych dr caseworkers and my own family that i shouldnt get a job because i will relapse well i am pretty proud of myself because i work in the mental health field in the same place i have been receiving services for almost 20 years i would pray so much to get my old self and life back and its happening i feel so blessed i want others who struggle with their diagnosis to know that its ok to feel defeated but you can never give up and we are strong,0
only a psychiatrist a dr who specializes in mental illness can diagnose you why do your friends think this? does anyone else? bipolar is nit just about having up and down moods there are two types of bp 1 which to be diagnosed you need to have at least one full episode of mania behaviour bp2 involves a more rapid cycling of depression and hypomania mania involves behaving recklessly putting yourself in danger losing inhibitions thinking you are invincible have special powers over spending extreme obssessions paranoia hallucinations but not all but main difference between mania and hypomania is that with mania the person loses their insight into what they are doing and believe it completely normal when its clear to others with hypomania the person is aware of their behaviour but unable to prevent the cycling its not usually as visibly destructive as mania can involve being really energetic ie starting something and then suddenly stopping anxious not sleeping obssessing compulsive behaviour  but if you are concerned you need to see a dr for a proper diagnosis,0
set an alarm on your phone,0
me too im scared to get off it if i ever do,0
i stopped because i had children and was worried if anyone told it would be possible i might get my babies taken away i have 3 nieces and i have seen the marks on all of them and i feel guilty like i was a bad influence on them i have scars and it is embarrassing for me the best advice i can give is to talk to someone you trust who wont be all judgemental on you someone who will let you het your emotions out so you dont feel the need to take it out on yourself therapy really helps too but it seems that may be an issue for you financially maybe look up a support group for help then also in therapy they teach you coping methods of things to help you keep from harming yourself exp: journaling listen to music go for a walk do some art work or call a friend whatever helps you personally every one is different good luck to you ❤,1
sorry that should say affect a lot of people will balk at this but part of dealing effectively with your condition is building resilience and self will and confidence thats nice talk for you have to toughen up i know its hard and it feels like going against yourself but to live well with your illness you will have to grow a thicker skin because people are hostile to things they dont understand and they are also very reluctant learners,0
this is a great question and one that shows a lot of fore sight on your behalf and by extention a duty of care to any potential child i struggled with that decision all the way through my child bearing years but could never grasp the concept of taking care of somebody else when i can barely take care of myself its not something you can back out of once its done if you dont like it i never did have children but it wasnt because i was afraid to pass anything on but because i could not have given a child the care they need maybe something to think about?,0
been there myself and i know what its like here is the suicide prevention lifelines number 1 (800) 273-8255 they are licensed counselors are are there to help not judge you can also seek help from a mental health professional you should never be ashamed for seeking help; its not a weakness,1
good luck just make your future the best you can i no its hard when you feel guilt from your past xxxx,0
to this i would say you dont want it to all be over if you did this wouldnt have got wrote its hard being in a dark place even more so when u can see yourself pushing loved ones away because your already scared they will leave you and pushing them away just heighten that feeling and then that makes u worse first you need to find a smile not a fake one for any means necessarya tv show a childs innocent smile once u have that slight brake thru now you need to grab hold of that and look deep find out whats making you angry more than not be aimed at yourself and work with it its only way i get thru them and when i get angry i like it i feed on it but i get a moment of clarity and thats what i grab hold of dont think about giving up that wont make u better that makes all your loved ones worse and possibly on the road that your on now,0
its not like im hiding my personality but when you carry social phobia borderline and others you dont really have any personality left the illness becomes your personality and people dont take kindly to unpleasantness,0
its not one of the official withdrawal symptoms but that doesnt mean it isnt related if youre unsure its usually best to consult with your doctor ,1
barbara i feel for you ♡ its a tough tough illness my mothers struggle hospitals meds electric shock therapy (made her sad to think about that horror) her illness is why i chose not to have children :(,0
i need medication to feel good otherwise my brain is a scary place to be,1
im a second year pharmacy student and though i have my own set of severe issues there are still certain requirements that i have to meet if i want to be a pharmacist i chose this career knowing the requirements and knowing my issues and accommodations only go so far i get extended time and private test taking for anxiety alone i medicate well when i have rotations to answer your question i have told my lecturers associate dean provost basically anyone that could support me and be in my corner but they have not given me options for special treatment in regards to rotations believe me i totally feel where you are coming from i had to run to my therapist once or twice a week to help me recover from the anxiety use your resources while meeting the requirements you chose this career and you are strong enough to do it! im not being mean just telling you what ive run across we still have to be respected professionals for our patients regardless of our own baggage if we want our careers bad enough! good luck!,0
sadly i have both but on the bright side  i manage them well  mostly through avoidancelol i like living in my little bubble of lonliness its safe here there is pizza too! i have bad days which can be very taxing and a trial of my strength and then i have good days which remind me why i keep going thankfully i have some epic kids who make it all worthwhile and make me smile every time im with them =p i dont think i would cope without their presence in my life,0
im troubled i have this friend 20 years since we first met and he doesnt know anything about my issues he is such a great friend its like having another brother at one point he came to visit so my niece has issues and she once told him how she suffers so i made mention one day of a situation she was in then said to him i feel so sorry for her family cause shes a constant embarrassment to them then i said ur lucky u dont have any one u know who has mental illness he looked at me and said oh god no if i found out they did i couldnt cope with that so for that reason and even though hes a wonderful friend i didnt tell him and most likely never will sigh in my life i had two nervous breakdowns and he did come with my mum to visit me in the hospital but the way he reacted to my comments that day im not sure if telling him about my issues is the right thing for me to do ,0
nope youre not the only one i have had to do this quite often over the last 35 of having this illness and those that say meds dont cure are right learning your triggers and developing coping skills is all you can do meds dont stop bipolar/depression and anxiety altogether they help control it to being able to survive/live with it i also remember this shall too pass me personally i spend a lot of time in prayer trying to refocus myself also you might have to try new meds every couple to few years i have too the ones i may be on just stop working it sucks but ive always found a new med path i hate adjusting to or trying to find new meds just know youre not alone and treat yourself kindly,1
my husband just came off sort of accidentally he forgot to put them in his pill pack for about a week they were next on the elimination list and his doctor said not to worry about it since he wasnt experiencing any issues just proceed without them no issues,0
you have anxiety ? as a condition  im a christian and i think this post is unnecessary and did thoughtless ,0
jeffrey lebahn all the dinosaurs feared the t-rex,0
drive3hrs of your life down the toilet wonderfully artisticshame about the plot the acting the lack character development and ridiculous gore scenes that added nothing but an sense of stupidity to an already weak film ryan gosling plays a guy with no nameand the point is hes a herobut not in the classic sense thats itbasically watch the first 20 mins then skip to the last 10 mins and thats it its incredibly pointless,0
i go through exactly the same its horrible and even worse when you carnt even control your own behaviour or understand yourself and why nobody understands you thats where im at with it all iv no diognosis but have social worker how do i go about diognosis thanks everyone  ,0
ohh ok maybe it just isnt good for people that have that and paranoia,0
look youll be ok i i suffer from chronic depression anxiety and bipolar and ocd and i have three beautiful children and im a great mom to my babies so dont let him put you down rl man doesnt do that but help you,1
mate honestly you need to stay busyive been treated for bipolar for 20 yearsthrough the good and the bad i stayed employednow ive got a reasonably successful careera family friendsbut you have to work for it nothings freeand ive got no doubt that to much time alone with your thoughts only ends in sadness,0
1 is not worse they are both equally difficult in different ways with 1 the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania type 2 (which is what i have) you experience whats called hypomania a less severe form of type 1s mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal oriented but with a short temper the cycles with type 2 are more frequent than type 1 what is dangerous about type 2 however is the extreme suicidal depression type 1 can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania but type 2 sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation so no type 2 is in no way less difficult than type 1 the good news however is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist,1
yesssss vicious horrible circle bailey morrell,0
dont know why you think this is weird to be honest obviously it is going to be hard for her seeing her ex and you together it would be unusual if it didnt make her feel awkward howerver it is really her issue and only she can move forward and accept things you dont say how long ago they were together - im presuming they had split before you and he got together as long as your cousin is not deliberately making things difficult for you both i would just carry on as normal thats really all you can do,0
helps a bit with physical symptoms but not great for full blown panic attack or when anxiety symptoms already started,1
talk to your doctor about what the risks are as this is your baby and you want the best,0
i had severe itching all over whilst i was coming off lithium it was horrible,0
my bad when it said "bipolar/depression/anxiety" i assumed it meant all that comes will the illness not everything everyone else brings to every other illness clearly this is an all illness page and seems its doesnt more then support these bad vices ,1
im bipolar 2 and i cant stop my meds so i have to accept that i wont have a second child anyway i just have to remember my last pregnancy and the first years of my sons life and i think its better this way i dontt want that my son suffer from ny illness (depression high anxiety etc) im not a doctor but my psychiatrist always told be that you cant take any meds when your pregnant i dont think you should take that risk good luck!,1
one of my sons does this especially when he sleeps for him it is anxiety he had a sleep trial done to rule out apnea,1
oh my goodness i was changed on to fluoxetine and victran i think thats how they were spelt i had the worst nightmares dreadful sleep at night i would be up 10 times a night putting washing on hanging it to dry and going to the loo i then drove to a place 40minutes from home and nodded off a couple of times ar pt the wheel i had to pull over ten minutes from my destination for a power nap to just get me there i felt like crap and thought my end was due however y doc agreed straight away to give me back my stresam and venlafaxine okay so i am back to 7 pills a day rather than 25 but i am happy again i guess each drug works differently for each person,0
im in between medications i accepted my diagnosis in 2014 when you see the worry in the faces of the people who love you you realize that theres a problem i have bipolar i borderline social anxiety ptsd and generalized anxiety disorder i dont want to see that look of worry and panic in their faces again its nice to silence the noise in your head ive probably battled all my diagnosis since i was 10 i can remember acting out of anger and frustration for so many years now that i lived with them for 27 years im still here ive learned to find artistic outlets to keep my mind busy i will always have that struggle but its up to me if i want to go back down that dark road again i choose not to let my mental illnesses take over my life im lucky that i have an accepting family and a wonderful husband it doesnt matter how others feel about me as long as i have my family in my corner i can face anything i know this sounds hokey but its true i want to defy the odds so many therapists list that i cant do this or that i want to prove them wrong it takes a lot of time to realize it isnt really you its just your brain is on a different wavelength than so called "normal" people but who is really normal anyway?,0
what are worry beads? i have really bad anxiety,1
no curing anxiety is not as easy as just turning to god by that logic just turning to god should cure a person of cancer or save them from dying of a fatal disease just like that and im pretty sure a lot of people with bipolar depression and anxiety who follow god are actually decent christians yet they still have those conditions this post is as bad as "just think positive" or "just relax",1
do smack heads hold their heads up high doubt it,0
i was on zoloft most pregnancy with both of my boys they started me at 25 mg both times my last pregnancy i was at 100 mg by the time i gave birth neither boys had any side effects the only side effect my ob was worried about for baby was irritability for my son (had two different docs with my boys) after he was born neither of my boys had irritability i also breastfed both boys my oldest is adhd and has anxiety but there is a ton of mental illnesses on both sides i have bipolar disorder gad adhd and ptsd zoloft didnt work the greatest but it certainly helped take the edge off it is one of those things where you weigh risks to benefits i would do your research before you start a medication check the studies done on the medication yes you do need to think of baby first but stress isnt good on the baby either stress can have side effects on the baby too from short to long term effects if you do take a ssri be sure to watch out for mania/hypermania being on only an ssri can cause bouts of mania i am a type 1 but i didnt really have issues during pregnancy do what is best for you and baby whatever you decide is something that should be respected youre a wonderful mother everyone is different and deals with their mental illness differently,1
the meds helps you relax and not make you laugh bieng bipolar and having the medication changes my life but im struggling to look for a job so that i could have medications at night to sleep and to relax in the day i hate this im bipolar for 11 years and no children,1
im afraid i cant help you with your medication as i am no doctor but i would like to say something instead you should be really proud that you go to work i dont know exactly what condition you have but i think anyone with severe mental health issues that works should be given a medal i also think there should be a government incentive for those who work or get back into work i work full time and sometimes i find it all a bit too much i am actually off work at moment having had an episode good luck hope you get the help you need ,1
my mom does this to me sometimes my partner and i chose to get married abroad and she decided she didnt want to come blamed money but we had offered to pay for her flight and she found an excuse anyway two days before we were due to fly she rang me and said that i didnt see what i was doing that it was because i was bipolar and depressed that i wasnt considering her feelings and we should essentially be doing things on her terms it upset me massively thing is it wasnt me i had done everything to include her and she had refused it was a means for her to try to gain control over me we went ahead with the wedding and didnt let her stop me you might love your partner lots but you have to ask yourself why he is doing this is he trying to control you too? x,0
mine knows all about my bipolar should never feel ashamed of who you arebe honest with yourself so you can then be honest to your partner im sure he will understand,0
i feel the world hates me and afraid of everyone but love everyone i dont fit in either but we arent supposed to fit in how do we help each other if we are all the same or think alike you are not alone ,0
i become obsessed with a thought and i forget to do important things i have to make lists to stay on task,0
no one will ever understand what we go through every day then we have mania when we feel we can accomplish anything then bang the depression sets in its soul destroying all i ask for is to be normal even with medication i still struggle,0
first off ive ptsd and dont know your infliction its a horribly addictive drug ever have brain shocks? objectively it did take my sadness and anger away but it left me with nothing i missed my feelings no matter how awful i felt like a zombie and i locked myself in a room for 4 years i would not prescribe it but im sure it has benefits its dangerous and addictive know that before hand it could lead to suicidal thoughts of hopelessness be wary of any pharmaceuticalthere is no magic fix doesnt exist,0
i dont know u well enough to tell u alot but im goin through the same thing like i was on different meds for bipolar depression and epilepsy but none of them worked so i stop taking them and im still struggling with it so i know what u mean,1
when it first started i remember having to stand at my desk at work and just stomp my feet it was such a miserable feeling,1
i am prescribed xanax when i first started taking benzos the dr told me to take one 3 times a day i was in college at the time i couldnt remember shit so i learned to only take them when i am having a panic attack or going into a situation i know will cause an anxiety attack when taking benzos this way the medication doesnt make you feel drowsy & forget things if you only take it as needed it simply calms you down & stops anxiety attacks be careful with benzos they are addictive & you will build up a tolerance if you take it when you dont need it with that said some people need them i recommend not taking them as instructed that is usually why people get into trouble with them they build up a tolerance then you have nothing to combat your worst anxiety to lessen my dependants on xanax when i feel anxious i take a product sold by thorne research its called "pharma gaba" for panic attacks take your benzo med i also take the pharma gaba 250 for sleep they use to have to give me heavy sedatives for me to sleep this product works better & you dont feel weird/hungover the next morning gaba also isnt habit forming/addictive i also recommend cannabis oil most people arent aware that it is legal for anyone to buy cannabis oil as long as it doesnt contain thc cbd oil can be purchased online and delivered to your door check out "charlottes web" there are many other places to purchase it as well,1
im more scared of the mania and what it turns me into i live in fear of having another mania episode because i dont think i or my family can live through it all again :(,0
ive been trying to conceive for ages now im on zolfot 100mg and quitiapal 100mg at night and 25mg when required am i going to continue to struggle because of my meds????,0
you are amazing your struggle is real and you have come far!! i kno its not the same but i wanted you to hear it at least once tonight ive been were you are as far as not getting the credit for the work youve done just to survive i was a cutter as a teen and i relapsed when i was like 20 and when my mom found out she told me i was doing it to hurt her even tho i was tring to hide it when your mom goes off on how well your sibling is doing walk in the bathroom put the phone down for just a second put your hands on your hips and hold your head high looking in the mirror and say "im a f***king super hero" and kno that you are! and pick the phone back up,0
im not taking meds they make me so ill i gave up on them 15 years of different types and they all floored me just struggle along now best i can,1
maybe a trial of buspar- it is specifically for anxiety but will take a couple of weeks to take effect has helped me a great deal,1
1 avoid alcohol 2 take your meds 3 rinse and repeat,1
hes not a friend sadly the world is filled with these people they are manipulative and self-centered and with time you will learn to avoid them because you will understand that you are much better than this youre on higher grounds and they dont like that they want to drag you down and you dont need toxic people in your life even if that means having to be on your own i can tell you briefly about my personal experience with these people read on if that interests you: i had best friends they were 4 we used to hang out together all the time for 7+ years we were like brothers then came that night when they were all hanging out at one of them as usual so i went up to see them and they started attacking me one said im a bitch one said im a hypocrite and a liar one said im insignificant and the last one just told me that since his "brothers" think of me that way then he wants no connection with me i tried to explain things but they werent listening it was like talking to walls so i hurriedly rushed out of the apartment drove my car fast away from them i was crying i felt miserable when i arrived home i noticed a text from one of them saying: "are you on drugs?" it was the most hurtful text i have ever received i will never forget this text instead of saying something nice they still wanted to hurt me some more i never replied and i never saw them again it was a shock for me not having friends especially that i lost touch with everyone else during these 7 years i tried to make connections it never worked i still feel the emptiness of being alone 10 years later but im growing tougher now im learning that i dont need people to feel good that i can do my own thing by myself i still miss having friends around though but then i remember that story and i think to myself perhaps im better off this way,0
thanksyou guys!!i was diagnose with bipolaranxietyand major depressive disorder about 7 months ago and still trying to get a full understanding of my mental illnesses,1
i am thinking one second ahead and it works sometimes the bloody thing is i cant predict when it comes and the thought of it coming scares the shit out of me but some how i am still here after 3 times i am not going to say be strong because it doesnt work but i suppose being and finding yourself in a environment where you are protected could be a help so called depression or what ever fucking sucks i am 5 days in good for me but i know i am due soon best of luck ,0
i am bipolar and suffer from anxiety and depression i too face the struggle of hypersexuality ,1

i have been in this exact situation i confided in someone i thought i could trust and the very same day i heard them making fun of my situation to someone else not only was i hurt and upset it also caused me to have issues trusting people however the positive that came from that is i handed all my problems over to christ cuz i know i can fully trust him and he will guide me in the right direction and i have become a much stronger woman !!!,0
anxiety is a monster not sure what you do about it as i never found the answer and no one ever seemed interested in treating that aspect of my illness; they only wanted to focus on and treat the depression i wish you the best,1
ive gained over two stone in 6 months and hate the way i look at the minute ive now developed social anxiety which is down to my meds quetiapine and my weight gain its a nightmare,1

i have alarms on my phone and hubby usually asks me at bedtime if i remembered :),0
it seems to be helping my anxiety to the point of im even sleeping better racing thoughts are even slowed down not 100% all the time but definitely seeing a difference,1
i actually follow a very similar regimen as you and i find it works for me it helps me deal with my symptoms without being medicated however i stay on a very strict diet and exercise regime and it helps for me to have regular contact with a therapist unfortunately however i have not been able to find a therapist so ive been cycling more due to life stresses but i hope to be back on track soon the ups and downs still happen ive had to do a lot of work in therapy groups and individually to learn coping skills to try to deescalate myself before i rev up to full on mania or severe depression best of luck to all!,1
i have bipolar type 1 rapid cycling forgot to add anxiety and panic attacks,1
i understand felicia im a single mom n with enough physical n emotional conditions to need n want to stop working dailybut i have to feed my daughter n keep a roof over her head every day is a constant struggle but luckily im still going,0
i have really bad anxiety and i used to hate thunderstorms they would scare me so much one day i was waiting outside for my parents to pick me up from school and a storm came out of nowhere and i was so scared because i couldnt go inside and it was so loud so i rang my mum upset and panicky and they made sure they got to me as quickly as possible but no matter how scared i was in that moment i havent been scared of them since because i had to face it without a choice! maybe next time theres a thunderstorm you can tell yourself that its going to be ok and face it! you could also imagine its just some crazy person on the drums xd but i hope you get over this soon! stay strong!,0
becca mckain i wasnt upset by your question once upon a time i would of asked the same thing but now i do forget sometimes my body reminds me but sometimes i can last all day sorry you feel you cant ask your question,0
adhd anxiety and depression whuuuut? why am i not the best damn person in the world yet? xd,0
positive anxiety positive elation - sometimes they mirror symptoms of bp and make us freak out - but dont be fooled they are *good* they are normal reactions,1
im in a similar boat im alone i have bpd depression and bad anxiety in everything going every friendship fails and relationships are messed up unfortunately you just got to push your way through hold that head up! try to make a life you want thats what im doing even though is a massive struggle chin up i know life is tough you can do it believe me i can relate to your pain,0
2 many labels on mental illness forget the stigma of a diagnoses and just work on getting better its hard work and dont be ashamed to seek helpbut be very cautious about prescriptions they can do more harm than good if dispensed from one that is not top notch in this field much over and unnecessary medicating going on,1
yes especially ones that live in or on my body eyelash bugsi cant think about them fleas ticks bedbugs i cant think about it or i go into phobia,0
the bit that concerns me as ive read alot about how depression meds can make manic depression/bipolar worse im terrified of getting worse as only thing worse i acting on my suicide thoughts when im manic i cant control my self ,1
it was so horrible i came to say that too luis barandik m,0
nadine van hoorde sorry i am on a lot of meds though i m sorry i wasnt clear in my comment ps the anxiety sucks big time,1
i have bp ii lamictal wellbutrin zoloft 1-2 100 mg seroquel for anxiety (my psychiatrist took me off all benzos) 400mg of seroquel at night primarily for sleep,1
know your trigers and  remove them even if you have to put them in a different perspective when my anxiety starts i look at the situation and deside if it worth my energy or can i move past it  can i ignore some things and take a deep breath and distract my self  till i feel better  i have stop going places that are trigers and stopped talking to people who are also get you a therapist and yall work on it together  in three years i have been in mental hospital 5 times i had to learn to take care of me you can too,1
you are not responsible for someone elses actions however guilty you may feel please seek professional support if you havent already for your loss you cannot get through all the emotions on your own the question will always be there it doesnt get easier you just slowly learn to keep going,0
i dont avoid certain conversations i avoid all conversations other peoples neuroses are projected onto my own,0
yeah i was diagnosed with everything i have at a very young age so maybe i just wasnt mature enough to receive that particular diagnosis does bipolar disorder often get confused with bpd? theyre pretty similar arent they? i know a lot about bipolar (which i have) and a little bit about bpd but ive never compared the two,1
your sister is wrong but i went through stuff with my mother in law and realized i focused on the drama because the bigger picture terrified me you are absolutely right in being mad! things are hard take care of yourself and your kids first hang in there and vent to us you are not alone ,0
look up saphris i take 10mg daily for harmful thoughts i also take geodon 80mg for bipolar and artain for side effects its a lot but ive been sick for 35 years and this is the best i can do and i still struggle so on those days i smoke weed to help slow down my thinking where i can control myself,1
its me too and i dont expect anyone to understand i always feel guilty for feeling this way but its not my fault its a no win situation ,0
bless you i used to be high flying multi tasking superwoman now i get overwhelmed with too much work but you are young and need to stick at this so personally i would take my medication and i would listen to some motivational getting up for a positive day guided meditation i would listen to another one at lunch or break time and then another relaxing sleep talk down at night good luck i love my work again now but am just not as speedy as i used to be good luck and dont let it beat youxx,1
the same thing happened to me when i switched from zoloft to wellbutrin it was very scary & like you i was almost admitted to the hospital,0
take a step down from rn think of being a school nurse less stressful,1
dont give up  i hope the person who upset you isnt working-class with people anymore there are good therapist out there who care  sending a hug,0
i think we tend to stick to what were know because we are scared of change i was in a bad relationship and stayed longer than i should have because id made another relationship mistake sometimes its better to admit a mistake and start again hope this is helpful x,0
without a doubt a dog is definitely a best friend my daft old mutt sensed me having a particularly dark and grim episode and she got up off her bed to come and lie next to my chair while continually looking up at me like she was reassuring me that she was there for me this may sound stupid to some but i for one believe that dogs can sense owners mood and wellbeing,0
i brag because there are days i cant ive been dealing with this illness since i was 19 so its been more than half my life i now keep a little welli call it my emergency backup kit with toothpaste shower wipes dry hair shampoo brush everything hygeine the struggles go on but i cant let it destroy other health care,0
there is no point when you stop looking for "the point" to everything you learn to enjoy the good time more and let go of the bad when i realized this i stopped feeling so stressed and stopped feeling like a failure no point just wonderful messy life ,0

ambien is extremely helpful for me along with tegretol valium 20mg seroquel 200mg and hydroxyzine 20mg i am diagnosed with bipolarmixedsevere and had insomnia for 2yrs+ that really took its toll me up for days little sleep isolated lost dramatic amount of weight etc ropinarole is very effective with restless leg syndrome and i take that am and pm very helpful in settling me down to a more comfortable level abilify is also another sleep med that seems to be very helpful to somebut did not work for me so there are other medications to help you can you get to see your provider on an emergent basis or maybe discuss with your providers nurse who will be your voice? i ended up hospitalized for almost 3 weeks and would not be discharged until my sleep stabilized i was also wrongly diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for years so many factors can be considered when insomnia is uncontrolled my case is extreme and i was a mess but not something i had control over you have to advocate/speak up for yourself i also had my husband with me before being hospitalized to substantiate my condition plus it was a legal intervention because i ended up in an uncontrollable destructive rage scared the hell out of me and my family wishing you the best and hope your provider takes you seriously,1
just shy i use to hate people saying that to mei dont take medication this is my own choice my life is strict its very scheduled and and i have a psychologist i have regular sleep hours very important but what has helped me massively is my gym workouts i work out alot could you see a psychologist ?,1
ive been in and out of hospital the last 11 years nothing to be scared of man,0
my daughter always makes sure she knows where she can go to decompress--there are often side rooms or lounges that are not so overwhelming there are several apps for deep breathing there is something on facebook for breathing i havent uploaded it because i have one but if you check the app store on your phone im sure you can find something i know on itunes you can find some great music if you put ear buds in you can listen and no one else will hear it my daughter has done that too when she has to be in big meetings stuff with rain helps her good luck it can be tough my daughter has bipolar and has panic attacks,0
i have bipolar i and anxiety which doesnt respond to meds i was introduced to mindfulness and ive never looked back look it up on the internet and there are also apps for your phone its a way of refocusing your thoughts of course if you can get to a psychologist/therapist then that would be great but try mindfulness it has been a godsend,1
i have borderline personality disorder and bipolar i as borderlines we wear our emotions or hearts on our sleeves we protect those who we dearly love and if you make us upset youll know it quickly i have severe trust issues if that tells you anything i dont take criticism very well either bpd is caused by a traumatic event at some point in our early lives you have to be a strong enough person to handle someone with bpd we can be quite emotional borderline just means we feel anger hurt depression 100x worse than the "normal" individual we can say things that we dont mean if were upset and those things can be pretty cruel at times this is the "i hate you but dont leave me!" mental health issue im just being 100% honest here if you can find a way to calmly talk to us then a bpd relationship is for you if you get upset easily nah it wont work my husband has been with me for almost 13 years now it can be done if you communicate effectively we can be quite possessive of the people we love and when youve done something wrong we have no problems cutting you out permanently were epic at silent treatments its like we need to protect ourselves from feeling that pain from that traumatic event again if we sense theres anything amiss were out of there psst but we love sex (at least some of us really do)! ;),0
i do this its like i have a bubble around me that shrinks what you need is a distraction the fear isnt really your environment its in your head,1
im over sensitive and was diagnosed with depression i stay awake most nights thinking about all sorts of things that make me cry im a marijuana advocate for the exact reason meds never worked for me and the only thing that ever did was that without the bad side effects like of other pharmaceuticals my family would never support although it does really work i wouldnt suggest seeing a therapist because theyre all just strangers and ive always became extra anxious and paranoid when i got out because i would think i said something bad or off but someone close to you to confine in like a best friend that wouldnt hold anything against you i just recently came out with my problems to a few of mine and it does seem to help a littleat least know youre not alone ,0
well here goes the anonymous aspect of the post lol ive been diagnosed with depression social anxiety and bipolar that was from my psychiatrist im on wellbutrin (which i love) lamictal and lexapro,0
i cant go too far from home or i get panic/anxiety bad i have to take valium & neurontin to go anywhere in a car,1
hey if you are starting a mood swing i doubt it is the wellbutrin this fast- it is actually a great antidepressant for bipolar disease i bet you are just starting to swing- the question is will it be the big mania swing or just a mixed state i second denise and kristin- if you need the hospital then just go back and tell them that person is a trigger for you and they will need to help you avoid that trigger,1
pip is not for mental health i get it due to my severe arthritis they ent bothered about mental health esa i also get for severe anxiety and depression but pip wont touch you,1
alcohol brings on major anxiety for me too,1
i worry about it too but i just have to remind myself that i am loved and can do anything i put my mind to,0
i have bp2 and ptsd i have been on a lot of meds over the years the #1 thing that i have learned is just because something works for someone else it doesnt mean it will for you all our chemical makeup are different and we all metabolize things differently it took a long time for me to find a good balance but i still have periods where i need extra meds when my regulars dont hold quite enough and i spiral down or start getting a bit out of control luckily i have had this disease long enough to be able to recognize the signs usually and to get help before im in troublei have been on topomax for about 15 years now for both migraines and the bp and at a high does have had pretty good control with the bp i only wish it worked as well on the migraines i also take cymbalta for fibro and the migraines if i begin to feel that i am having issues with the bp my doc places me on lithium er 75mg for a short period to help me get through or advert any crisisi also take anti- anxiety meds due to the ptsd i hope this help you some i have been through many doctors and the best thing i can tell you is to stay informed know what meds are out there what there side effects are and what is available to you on your ins if you dont have ins a lot of the pharmacies like wal-marts $4 list have list of medications that are a reduced priceor there are prescription discount cards that will help knock down the price of you script you simply put in the name of the drug in their search engine and it tells you which pharmacy will be cheapest and it gives you a coupon to print for that price if it hadnt been for that program last year med rx my family wouldnt have been able to have gotten half of our meds we needed and it costs nothing to participate good luck to you,1
absolutely i struggle at work so by the time i get home im in bed watching tv by 6:30 i cant stand being anywhere else i sent to dose for an hr or two then wake but its still better to be asleep even for a little while awake,0
i am currently unmediated as i am breastfeeding i did have the option of taking my medication with regular blood tests for both bub and i but chose not to i struggled throughout my pregnancy but seem to be doing ok now (8 months later) i struggle with anxiety at times and have recently struggled with high moods i was just thinking today a i am looking forward to going on my medication though,0
if hes not currently seeking help this sounds to me like hes not open to it so you need to get as far away from him as possible bipolar is a life long illness & if hes not seeking help things will not get better will not get better your just trying to rationalise a way to keep the relationship going & you just cant in this situation even medicated & counselled he will continue to have episodes they may be less violent it i doubt it very much in this situation because he knows he has control over you through fear,0
i took klonopin and abilify for years and had no business driving on them i gained 90 lbs and look back on that as a very over-medicated dark unnecessary period in my life i rarely put down anyones medical treatment as i am not their doctor but i am telling you my experience and this fact: it has been discovered that adderall and meth are chemically essentially the same thing id be very scared to meet someone on all the meds your on and adderall,1
yes and it sometimes scares me,0
the high sex drive is a side effect of some medications it happened to me when i was prescribed seroquel i also had obsessive thoughts i had enough after a few months and asked my shrink to change my meds the meds im being weened off of now effexor made me lose interest in everything now im another step closer to being completely off the friggin things my interests are coming back thoughts are clearer but i do have periods of deep depression and for some reason i started cutting myself when the sadness is at its worst ive been also diagnosed with major depression something like 12 years ago but something else was wrong,1
i know this might sound silly but when you get like that try taking a really hot shower while listening to some music just make sure its upbeat feel-good music that usually helps me when i get to feeling all pissed off and crappy like that and dont just stand in the shower that gives your brain the opportunity to dwell on whatevers making you mad wash your hair shave brush your teeth etc anything thatll keep your mind focused on something other than whats going on in your head,0
i mostly have fear from nighttime/dark sky ones (due to a thunderstorm childhood trauma) where i live sometimes it dont get that dark during them i find closing windows if you have somebody living with you ask them to close the curtains and if its dark turn on lights itll help reduce your seeing the flashes of lightning headphones or a stereo play your favourite music songs and if you have the option to use the fade into songs use that so theres no stop between songs if possible stay in a area/room where there is no windows the most effective thing i found though was facing the fear looking out the window during it i cant go out during a thunderstorm and i cry if i catch myself outside during an unexpected one but for the most part watching it has helped me get over some of the fear maybe watch thunderstorm videos first before watching one from your window also use lightning apps it tracks how close the lightning is to you so should prepare you more keep an eye on the weather forecast keeping prepared in case of one helps i am on depressants and medication for my anxiety but i dont take anything for thunderstorms (and i only started my medication recently and we havent had one since i started my medication so my advice should work for you medicine free) also if your fear or anxiety causes adrenaline use it i found the energy from that helps a lot keeping me alert and makes me look forward to the thunderstorm rather than fear it i know thats a lot of information and i hope it makes sense and i hope it works,1
i been taken it now for about 5months and still hasnt been affectively doing anything doctors keep trying everything with itmy body fighting itnow with latunda lets seeall i want is to get some sleepi only get 2 hrs a day and feel horribleany suggestions????,0
no real issues with low dose seroquel yet just make sure you have 8+ hours to sleep after taking it otherwise you might be a zombie the next day cymbalta - believe your doc when they say do not stop taking it without consulting the doc; the withdrawal symptoms range from annoying to potentially life-threatening,1
theres many different causes of voices actually trauma bipolar personality disorders did stress you cant just tell someone theyre schizophrenic do you not know how intimidating that is!! do you have no heart?,1
may i ask how well lithium works for you? i take latuda and risperidone but i am also struggling and i was diagnosed in 2014 so ive had every medication for bipolar there is but lithium and my dr suggested it but ive heard horrible things about it so im just curious on how well its worked for you  thank you ,1
well this was took the words right out of my mouth  definitely describes me  story of my life how i feel every day im feeling so much hurt pain sadness sorrow and despair but i wear a mask so its all hidden  i pretend im ok and i pretend im strong but inside im struggling and need help behind my fake smile and phony laughter and behind my sarcasm and sass and attitude and anger im fighting an inner battle that no one sees,0
my daughter is 15 and suffers from depression i couldnt get her to do anything like school (she still struggles with it) shopping hanging with friends nothing all she wanted to do was isolate herself and stay in bed i was at a loss i finally sat down with her and told her that i was really worried about her and of there was something i could do she of course told me no and to just go away and leave her alone well with me being a mother i told her that i couldnt just leave her alone i talked to her and said that i knew that she didnt want to talk to me or anyone in the family so i told her that she needed to talk to someone about her feelings and how to deal with all the stuff that was going on around her and it was making her feel i would set her up with someone outside of the family that would not judge her all they would do is listen i didnt use the word therapy or counseling just someone to talk to she finally agreed she has been seeing her counselor for over a year now and loves her she was also put on prozac and it does work for her i dont know if this helps but i thought i would put it out there just be there and let them know that they are loved,0
yes i feel very similar i was diagnosed with mixed anxiety depressive disorder as is my 18 yr old daughter ive just finished treatment for my 2nd breast cancer in 12yrs i take amitriptyline & epilum i feel i am a burden to everyone & have suicidal thoughts,1
i enjoy being productive and more creative the feeling of not caring what others think is good too but i always fall back into depression before i can finish what i started i tend to have a million things going on at once and none of them complete when im feeling depressed all of that tends to make me feel overwhelmed guilty and disgusted with myself so its a toss up i only like being manic in the moment,0
this means so much to me thank u for getting this i suffer from depression and anxiety and ptsd and i am also bipolar,1
i hear the same thing dailyit just makes me worse like why cant i just shake it offwhy am i so weak tired explaining it to ppl now i just say yup thats me a wack job i really dont think ppl can relate unless they experience it i am a horrible person most daysmaybe it is all my fault hope u get some support before you turn cold like me,0
i have autism spectrum disorder and am medication resistant before my autism diagnosis i was given the diagnoses by various psychiatrists psychologists counselors and therapists od bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder major depressive disorder post traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder one pa of a very respected psychiatrist ordered me to be on a medication regimen which required me to take 13 pills a day one medication (very recently) had given me such a severe allergic reaction that i remained in a state of psychosis for 6 months an elevated white blood cell count (along with an extensive barrage of other diagnostic tests ruling out other causes of an elevated wbc count) confirmed the allergic reaction i cannot take psychotropic medications because of my hypersensitivity to others i cannot be in a relationship talking about my traumatic life experiences to a therapist helped a little reaching out to a free community service which sent case workers out to my home once a week to check on my suicidality status helped hiring a therapist that performed home visits was helpful hyper-evaluating myself daily checking for signs of progress was frustrating but helped me stay focused on my symptoms from an objective rather than subjective point-of-view super-studying the diagnoses i was given helped me understand my enemies were not my family but were neurological & psychological the only being and force that has brought me through to the point of healing ive reached now and delivered me from people which were feeding off of my illness was my lord jesus my god never left me he never talked down to me never discouraged me and told me only beautiful truth the mind and the physical world have a bidirectional relationship which causes either damage or healing to occur the same is true for our spiritual life it effects our mind and our body i had no choice but to turn to the lord i encourage other sufferers to do the same,1

dont be too hard on yourself hun!!! your body is going through a huge transition and your hormones are all over the place too sometimes we put things down to our bi-polar when actually we are going/feeling totally normal emotions feelings and tiredness related to something else i definitely would keep in touch with your gp though even if its only to talk about how youre feeling what youre thinking and to relay any of your worries or concerns to them sometimes just talking things through with someone can make you feel better and your gp can also give u lots of advice and reassurance i personally wouldnt change my medication at such a time youre nearly there now im the same over my medication now due to previous changes made i didnt react well to the ones they wanted me to try and i had to stand my ground about reverting back to my original meds of sertraline and quetiapine if its not broken dont fix it i say maybe it is just that youre just going through the normal pregnancy motions and always remember you are strong brave and courageous not only because you battle on every day with your own issues but also because u are fighting through pregnancy and for your baby youre a trooper!!! never forget that!!! i wish u all the luck in the world and best wishes in the future tx,0
chronic persistent emptiness and low mood is one of the characteristics of bpd when i was much younger i used to overdose like you every few weeks partly as i felt so bad i wanted to be in physical pain but also to cleanse and start again as i would try to do things get on with my life but things would always just spiral downwards every few weeks at the time i dont think i had insight but looking back i do still self harm i hadnt for years up until past few years when things have been bad again im in the uk and i was diagnosed with bpd about 25 yrs ago at a time when it wasnt even thought to be a proper mental illness and as a result no treatment i have since been diagnosed with bp2 and also suffer from depression and anxiety things have changed since then and it is recognised as serious mi and therapy especially dbt which is a form of cbt is the most beneficial so far as medical records i dont think anyone has ever mentioned bpd or any other of my diagnoses in any detail gp or consultants and oh always write in very general terms in what they say they may refer to underlying mh issues but they will not specify diagnosis i have always worked in my adult life and have been on long term sick several times recently 3 months and 11 months 2015-2016 and 8 months in 2012-2013 the medical line from hospital basically says nothing and gp will ask what you want put on your line is stress depression etc i have never really had specific therapy for my bpd so it has been always underlying everything theres no specific medication for bpd but depression anxiety commonly accompany bpd or as a consequence of how it impacts on your life even on the medications especially antidepressants which i know help i still struggle with feelings of emptiness and pointlessness and feeling worthless but i can tell when im also severely depressed and when im not of course you may not have bpd but it isnt to be ashamed of and unless you tell people no one will know,0
i was on pristiq for depression/anxiety my entire pregnancy and ended up going up dosage to 200mg/day the only issues bubba would have faced was possibly some lung issues but as long as they were aware of it they would be prepared to handle it he was born via c section 2 weeks early as he was 44kg/10p125o and i had a lot of fluid the biggest risk to his health was actually my gestational diabetes not my meds i was told that i would be able to breastfeed and stay on my meds and that would actually be beneficial to bubba as would reduce his withdrawal symptoms i made the decision myself to bottle feed i did try breast feeding initially but i think c section and being separated from him while he was in special care for 9 days didnt help while a small part of me missed bf you still get the closeness and contact while bottle feeding and it also allows your partner to have a hand in it too :) please talk to your gp/psych/obstetrics dr about possible side effects for you and bubba my drs keep talking about good outweighing risks at the end of the day it is how you feel too if you feel the anxiety of being on meds and possible risks will be worse for you than tell your drs that here if you need it mumma!,1

yes play solitaire it takes your mind off you & is the best for me to relieve anxiety,1
hi i suffer bipolar aswell and have emotionally unstable personality disorder mine means that im impulsive and irrational its to do with how your child hood impacts on your way of growing up for instance my dad was a drinker and beat my mother my mother was cold and showed no emotion or love and other aspects of my life made it harder to let my emotions grow with becoming an adult you should asked your dr what kind of personality disorder you have and why she thinks that hope this has helped good luck with getting your answers x,0
i also have bp2 and anxiety i choose to medicate my depressive episodes get so bad it is my only choice if i want to be some semblance of "well" it has taken me a long time to find the right combination of meds but i feel for me it is the best choice i just started going to therapy again too and that has helped immensely,1
same im demi with hypersexuality as well but also thanks to lots and lots of abuse i have an aversion to sex on top of that its really fucking confusing,1
of course in fact id rather be i worry about being with someone neurotypical who will either take advantage of me or end up resenting me because they dont understand,0
im on permanent disability now after almost 30 years of driving myself into the ground however i have very severe bipolar bpd major anixety and panic disorder ptsd not saying you shouldnt apply for it but here in canada generally for just anxiety and ptsd they wouldnt quailfy you for permanent disability just ppwd which is given for 2 years to help get your self ready for the world due to the severe trauma i suffered growing up and everything that happened and numerous suicide attempts and fighting for help i got a new doc who immediately saw how much i was suffering and got me on disability i also have a now 8 year old son whom i help raise with my inlaws due to the severity of my illnesses i would suggest starting with therapy maybe doing a job few days a week and finding other ways to help you not saying you dont quailfy for aid but your still very young and you may have a hard time being accepted for such funding however like the one lady said every one is different i wish you the best,1

you shouldnt have to keep such a secret if your bf truly loves you he will stand by you know matter what although it may take some time to get through and he may also be upset for not sharing your mental health issues with him sooner you just need to rip that bandaid off my partner and i are high school sweethearts he suffers from depression and has anger issues cause of it and i suffer from depression and anxiety we can never seem to help ourselves in our time of need but we always stand by each other in those times of need moral of my story tell your partner if he loves you hell stick by you my partner and i suffered from mental health long before we met and now we conquer it together,1
i dont because while at times it makes me feel confident and fantastic- at other times it makes me quite agitated and irritable and i can be hurtful when i am that type of manic,0
yes suicide does hurt loved ones it still will never be the way to help a suicidal person to heap guilt on top of their self loathing to try and get them to stop feeling the anguish they are feeling would you also tell someone with cancer that they cant die because their loved ones would be hurt? depression is an illness just like any other #endthestigma and stop trying to tell depressed people their disease is less important than other peoples,0
i have adhd bipolar and anxiety i am on lamictal xanax buspar and just started on rexulti because seroquel was making me fat and latuda made me aggressive really liking the rexulti i rapid cycle and havent been this stable in years,1

i recently started taking this and on several occasions had nightmaresi havent had then since i was a kid so very scary,1
im a nurse and have bipolar depression i believe this makes me a better nurse people see a mental illness as something terrifying its not it makes us stronger and more aware of other that suffer take your meds counselling and time for your mental health no one is allowed to discriminate against you you know your own limits be a great nurse and make a difference,1
suicide has so much stigmatism to it and when people hear the word they feel like you just assulted someone suicide is never the right answer to temporary problem but its ultimately your choice no one fully understands when someone is at that point in their life all the doctor visits medicine or counseling will not help if you have reached that point what people dont understand is when someone thinks or asks about suicide they are looking for help even tho they deny it they are hoping just one person will reach out and help them its sad because a lot of people say and do so much that the person finally gives up because their need wasnt met instead of posting comments that are negative rude and mean we should reach out to them and see if there is any way we can help suicidal people need love caring and understanding in this desperate need/time of life encouragement that is not positive will only further their despair,0
i liked what you said you have a good point i say im bipolar when i had cancer i never said im cancer but to me saying im bipolar is no more shameful than saying im diabetic its not a label - its an explanation,0
look into having your meds adjusted try some positive stress relief (music coloring beads gardening) move around & get some sun just got keep trying till you find what helps,1

my advice would be to seek advice from a professional read about different anti depressants and their possible side effects - dint think anyone who has responded to your question as referred to anti depressant which is what you are asking about many antidepressants are also good for anxiety ocd etc too any drug has side effects ranging from minor to more severe and very common and rare sometimes you need to weigh up benefits of a drug against side effects and accept themas long as they are not severe,1
dont worry about the bipolar diagnosis lots of depression is actually bipolar but undiagnosed its easier to deal with once you know what you have and get on the right drugs get off any drugs that give bad side effects asap though,1
my answer might not be popular but yes it absolutely can you certainly cant put everyone in a box thou depending on how the person has learned to manage their disorder  like if someone has a history of not taking their meds or is in denial of their disorder  each person is different but unfortunately the "mania" is the irrational part that follows no logic,1
if his condition is genetically inherited he is actually his real self in which case no intake of any form of medication will alleviate any of the symptoms associated with the illness moreover uninhabited illnesses exacerbate the inherited ones which are marginally aided by medications  my inherited illnesses are generalized anxiety disorder and bipolar disorder exacerbated by acquired borderline personality disorder rapid cycling moods ptsd and ocd the powerful medications i am on set me off into a middle-of-the-road dimension as i remain marginally well,1
its been suggested to me to try ect from my psychiatrist but i have been hesitant due to the potential loss of memory i am extremely resistant to most antidepressants/antipsychotics but for some people it has worked wonders!,0
yes i agree he is incapable of being a good support to you you need to go to the doctors immediately and get on bipolar/depression/anxiety medicine you also need to be strong for your son and do yourself a huge favor-quit seeing your sons father immediately when you have been on your medication for 6-8 weeks and can make a sound decision talk to him about seeing your son you and your sons well being should always come first trust me when i say that your son sees the stress you carry and could have a negative effect on him it happened to me with my daughter until i straightened myself out if you do need a shoulder please inbox me i will not judge you but i will not lie to appease to either im a straight shooter i have everything you have and i have dealt with it my entire life i am not a doctor so i wont give you medical advice except make a drs appt asap michelle,1
this may be the family that i have so desperately needed for over 40 years,1
he agreed to give me the amount of sex i wanted in a week guess what i got moaning his dick was sore and his tummy muscles too booooo hard life right ? yes you are right its hard not to think about something when you are addicted to it yet not getting your fix then i feel like im going without  and then angry and upset and then unwanted its a nasty cycle,0
i wish this worked for panic attacks i begin puking and sweating and faint before i even know what happened cute meme tho,0
latuda works wonders for me and xanax for anxiety,1
to be honest i would be relieved to hear this from a professional every time i have been open about these thoughts being my default i wake up with a hefty hospital bill i dont have any plans its just a part of my life that i deal with i cant tell you that youll always have these thoughts because i am not here to play armchair psychologist but maybe the finality of what the doctors are saying is disturbing to some dealing with bipolar and borderline is tough its work every single day of your life you are fighting i know i am some days it exhausts me so much that these thoughts resurface at the forefront of my mind but once again as long as i dont have a plan theyre not a cause for alarm to me personally,0
those admonitions place so much unnecessary pressure on people if a person does not already have mental illness the anxiety and personal second guessing they create is detrimental so if you do have mental illness those admonitions are just that much more so i take them with a grain of salt making the most of life looks different for every person and i believe contentment which comes in many forms is preferable to the often elusive "happiness" sometimes just getting through the day is a huge success,0
sorry zee im the 33 year old i was married for 9 years 3 babies to that one man too may i add just in case bipola is caused by having kids to different men my mother and father have been married for 41 years last feb and she too also suffers depression and anxiety my father always by her side no matter what so that marriage shit you can put it up your nose n blow it outta your bum dumb things that come out of some peoples mouths can and will one day push that suicidal person over the edge got nothing nice to say keep it to your self hope to god you dont ever be in a place not only am i in but 1000s of people too,0
ive been diagnosed with both bipolar 1 & 2 i have mixed manic episodes i have struggled with the depression part of it for years & was relatively oblivious to being manic because its the closest to "normal" ive been able to feel i only recognize the symptoms now since ive been diagnosed & educated about this debilitating disorder beforehand i just thought i was extremely depressed i can relate to what youre going through i remember many days of not being able to get out of bed to shower or get dressed all i felt like doing was cry & sleep i couldnt eat & having to interact with another human being was a living nightmare i tried many different medications until i finally found one that made a difference not all medications affect people in the same way so its important to work with a mental health physician to figure out what works best for you im not gonna say medication is a fix all but it definitely does decrease symptoms & make life more bearable & worth living again getting enough rest is also just as equally important sometimes during a manic episode sleep may seem impossible & there are medications available to help with that but personally i choose melatonin which is all natural above all just try your best to stay positive & on your worst days remind yourself " this too shall pass!" a good support group or just one person you can trust & talk to when youre having a low also benefits greatly hope this helps encourage you to keep pushing forward ,0
ive been med free since 2013 but im also only bipolar 2 so i dont have huge mania its mania to me but by doctors standards its nothing i have more depressive episodes than anything and im easily stressed but im personally better off like this than i was with meds i also do not have suicidal ideologies and never have so its probably easier for me than someone with them some people it works for and some it does not,1
started on it 2 months ago and it has been life changing fori do have depressionanxiety and borderline personality at first i felt "flat" and emotionless but then realised it was my background anxiety had stopped so my brain was quieter if that makes sensei totally agree with the dry mouthwe are slowly increasing the dose till hopefully i will have peace x,1
i havent had a manic episode in a while but have been very depressed ive been isolating sleeping eating poorly and drinking a lot of beer im lonely but dont want to be around anyone one of my meds is seroquel which i hate i take it for sleep and its unpredictable most nights ill sleep for two hours wake up eat all kinds of junk and then go lie down for hours waiting for sleep to come its horrible but it beats a manic episode im in the doctors office right now waiting to see him,1

i was on lithium for 9 years it worked amazingly but is a terrible drug it dehydrates you because it has high concentrations of sodium in it which first off do serious damage to your kidneys secondly it makes you drink a lot if you get even the slightest bit dehydrated on it it turns all your body organs toxic to themselves and will cause organ failure of all your organs and you can die (same with if your lithium levels are even the slightest bit high which is why they have to do frequent bloodwork) that is why there are warnings to stay out of the sun at all times and drink a lot also if you ever get pregnant on lithium it is known to cause severe deformities such as missing or duplicate body parts non functional organs and organs forming outside of the babys body even you can also never stop this med cold turkey or it will kill you i missed 3 doses in a row once (2 mornings and a night dosetotal of 1200mg) and by 3pm that day everything was spinning my heart was racing i felt nauseous as hell and ended up fainting the drs confirmed it was due to withdrawal of the lithium i would never recommend this drug it was the absolute most effective med i was ever on but its so scary,1
i am bi-polar ii rapid cycling pschzoid effective disorder generalized anxiety disorder w social and agora phobias ptsd and have panic attacks on top of all of that i have a twice as long list of physiological/ musculoskeletal problems i take 3 daily psych meds - saphris which started at a xl high dose 2x/day to get symptoms under control i am now on the lowest dose 2x/day lamictal a mood stabilizer i am on a medium dose to keep the rapid cycles on a sort of gentle float of a balanced teeter totter i shift a little here little there but its manageable and my anxiety med that i take 2x/day as needed at least 4hrs apart when as part of my ongoing therapy i force my self to go to a social area be it out to lunch dinner breakfast to the grocery store to a park or to and i must do my best to stay in said setting for 30 min to 1 hr med management helps stabilize you so you know when you are stable what you can truly handle and not bury which got you where you are now is stuffing it down deep and not actually being equipped with the tools and skills to work with ir,1
when you cant say anything correct to someone with bipolar disorder try just listening even if it means listening to us cry she isnt in control of her actions my mother has often been my life line even though i have said horrible things to her she knows me & still loves me possibly you are the only person she thinks loves her unconditionally,0
personally id set an alarm if at all possible set the title for the alarm as "breakfast" or "remember to eat" its something i do on my days off work because i tend to get preoccupied and end up just having little to no food or fluids setting an alarm has worked wonders and now i eat on or around the time the alarm is set naturally because im so used to doing it,0
back when i was in high-school i was put on buspar for my anxiety and depression mom would bring me my meds with instant oatmeal and hot cocoa usually for breakfast to take them with before i even got out of bed it gave me such bad tummy aches that id often be doubled over in pain for a few hours after taking them i ended up having to repeat my junior year of high school because i missed on average 1 day a week of school cant pass classes when you miss 36 days first period tapering of to 27 days 6th period all in one semester (if i started feeling better id go to school late not skip the whole day) what ended up working for me was effexor (combined with the adderall i was taking for add),1

i dont know of anyone who has used it either however the psychiatrist i work with has seen it quickly bring patients out of very deep depressions from my understanding you do not run the risk of permanent memory loss with it either as seen in electroconvulsive therapy another treatment option for resistant bipolar,1
lamictal made me barf its not worth it then they tried many othersprozac in am zyprexa in pm im not happy to report that the side effects lamictal made me so sick in 2 days all the others ive taken over 20 years were never worth i just treat my anxiety with xanax ( small dosage) and hydroxizine ( visteral) which helps with anxiety,1
i think about it often its so true just to end the pain and torture of your own mind no cureonly band-aid fixes i wish almost daily that i wasnt here at the same time i am scared to die and dont truly want to die i am too scared to take my own life but i definitely want to some days more than others :(,0

cant believe how powerful the mind is sometimes the negative feelings just take over and yes its hard to feel alive and happy even when you try so hard to block them out they just come straight back in leaving you feeling empty and confused very hard to face the day sometimes,0
this is so true  we have no choice but to be strong  we have to fight to do the simplest things  we battle so much unimaginable pain  and hurt sadness and despair and sorrow its a stuggle just to deal with everything  its not for pussies thats for shure  ive been struggling for years  bout ready to give up  rather die then keep going,0
dont trust people in the "church" that is only a building an institution trust in the word i had the same dilemma but here it is psalm 118:8 "it is better to take refuge in the lord than to trust in man" the church is just a institution but the real church are believers in jesus i know some people might not believe some here are atheists etc others might ask why the lord would curse them with a sickness i myself has struggled with this i suffer from bi-polar too and have done some crazy things during mania i dont believe in the church as an institution at all i do believe in jesus the only way human sickness is because the flesh is fleeting it is manifestation of our sin it is flawed and degrading due to our sin since the exile from eden we are no longer in his image there is no cure for our ailment yet but keep faith it has helped me in some dark times,0

the problem with those with mental illness is they can easily be taken advantage of and people can easily manipulate them make them feel like they are crazy at fault all that time because they refuse to take responsibility for their own actions the gaslighting mentioned by alice sounds a lot of what hes doing if he refuses to see that you are ill and making an effort to get better and be supportive i know this sucks you dont need him its not healthy for you to constantly struggle to be better so you dont lose a relationship that is not doing well because your partner is manipulating you into feeling worse focus on you your health and mentality is all that matters right now not him,0
nope as much time as people like us spend self-loathing and wallowing in mental and emotional misery its nice to let loose and just do our own thing when our shitty-bo-gitty brains let us,0
dont be ashamed youve done nothing wrong nothing to be ashamed about we just are who we are as for them? theres no educating the ignorant just keep stepping do you ;,0
from the sounds of it she lives where i live and that will be no help they may possibly give her 1 dose of an anti anxiety med and send her out unless youve attempted suicide you get close to nothing they will call her med seeking and not help i was not suicidal but wanted to harm my childrenwent in immediately to be hospitalized they put me in a hall on a bed for 12 hours in er then sent me home because i was no danger to anyone and they couldnt waste a bed on me,1
i got rejected and wish i had never applied i became very anxious during the application and assessment period one of the reasons i given was that ihad a good understanding of my illness i have bpd no shit sherlock ive had to live with this for 12 years of course i have researched and read about my illness,0
excuse me but in saying not to use anything as a crutch and that no one helps and if she fails oh well are you advising this depressed traumatized girl begging for help not to seek professional treatment and medication and to just live with herself in a suicidal state? medication and therapy are not crutches any more than my blood pressure medicine or allergy medicine are no more than my friends insulin is by your reasoning it was a bad thing my brother went and got surgery and bars and pins put in his ankle when he broke it in 4 places he should have just lived with it in the state it was and if he was crippled for life oh well im sorry for what ever you went through in your life to make you devalue everyone else but please lets not turn this support page into a place we basically tell people to go ahead and kill themselves,0
bi-polar with anxiety stress phobias is a bitch depression mixed in and life can be a muttha fricker friends and family hanging in there is very tuff and stressful but believe me its appreciated and so important to we who suffer all i have to say be well,0
i have been on cymbalta for three years i actually feel great the drawbacks however are the side effects i am experiencing it is apparently affecting my nervous system which makes me sweat a lot and i mean a lot! i am a health care aide and i sweat so badly at work that my scrub top is soaked within an hour into my shift its not a common side effect however i am just unfortunate to experience it i just lowered my dose which was hard due to the side effects of that the sweating has improved minimally if at all i hope this helps! feel free to message me if you want to chat more!,0
oh yes i heard that also something about lithium levels needing to be tested regularly because if theyre too high they can cause severe health risks?,1
i agree cameron harman if she cannot handle it you will know how she feels and can agree to keep an emotional distance between each other but you will not feel the need to actively avoid her on the other hand she may be willing to give it a go then you wont again have to actively avoid her do you know if she has noticed you avoiding her? dont you think she may take this to mean you really are not interested? everyone deserves some happiness dont screw it up for both of you,0
im going through the same thing finding out about his affairs triggered a horrible manic episode which scared away all my friends so now its just him that i have i really feel for you going through this but its also nice to not feel like the only one,0
im on all types the only thing that i have to stay away from is ativan it made me so tired that i was late for work anyone that knows me knows that since i have anxiety i fear being late so i get places an hour early that really screwed me up i take xanax which is not the best but works the best for me i get a little tired but not near as bad as when i was on ativan but i would definitely try your options because everyone has different side effects from medicines good luck finding something that works ❤,1
if things dont get better look at the meds im now on i use to take effexor but ultimately it did not work for me i would really like to to see you try a mood stabilizer and lithium is the best although the name sounds harsh i know its been such a great for me dealing with depression and anxiety good luck honey!,1
easy one!! there is nothing you can take that will deal with anxiety attacks as such you wont grow out of them diazepam does work but your better off changinf your mental well being get a cat walk a dog music works for me #junglist,1
fear and loathing ?,0
now *i* just realized from ypur comment: i could have had my fitbit alarms this whole time lol,0
at least you have your family they scream at you im alone with 2 kids my daughter is an adult and my son is 11 struggling we autism right now hes in the hospital my daughter wants the same way and wasnt real easier for me but look i made because i start speak up and tell people would ever win the city said they got help i need the help that the city offer and they will help you i have couple hospital i live in the bronx new york not even if i was crazy i will leave my son over here so what i do i travel to manhattan new york and we got to help with this serve as a human being sweetie its always positive if you leave far away in town you dont get the help you dont have to tell you family feud adult get a train get a bus and go to another town that you can get the help that you deserve because anywhere they have to treat you the right way and then if you wanted to get in contact with your family you put them in the list so they can called you but you have to let me know where you are at to see if you location will help me more to help you,0
absolutely i go through those same thoughts every day ive been diagnosed with bipolar disorder anxiety with panic attacks ptsd add and severe depression have you considered seeking out a therapist or a psychiatrist to read diagnosis and see if medication may help?,1
oh i did have side effects uncontrolled twitches inability to swallow and i feel like something else but the benefit greatly outweighed i also have rhemetoid arthritis and it helped my pain,1
rapid cycling bipolar disorder is particularly almost impossible to live with as mania and depression over short periods or even from day to day the moods may even merge as they mix and so we have rapid cycling mixed moods there is a link between mania and depression thus with a mixed state mania is depression in a more intense form mania and depression are which are dreadful diseases are one disorder mania can moreover but distinguished from depression by degree and manifestation jean pierre falret in the mid-nineteenth century posited that strong depression often occurs before during and after mania bipolar disorder is a truly dreadful illness and i have the rapid cycling divergent form with hypo mania which is more difficult to treat i would not wish it on anyone,1
i need to start doing this i just got signed up for intermittent loa where i have 4 /8 hour shifts a month that i can use for call outs(they dont need to be used) if i having a flare upi have a miscarriage in june and my moods ever since have been horrible so i ended up getting wrote up at work for my call outs some days are harder then others and i think this is a great idea so that my doctor can see what my patterns look like thank you for this idea,1
yeah the rage is really bad im a very silent person and i keep the rage under wraps especially at work since i get bullied i dont want anyone to see that side of me im like two different people and its scary that is why i dont have any friends or a social life ,0
my son had the genetic components but trauma (both physically as a baby from being very sick and mentally-really showed up after horrible bullying) increased and intensified his doctors (neurologist genetics and physciatrist) have told us he likely would have had some sort of anxiety/depression but the traumas brought it on younger and more intense definitely can be a combination of the two,1
i have bipolar and my husband has severe anxiety we celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary two days ago,1
bipolar ii gsad and hypomania depakote 250 mg/d and paxil (15-25 mg/d depending on what is going on in my life) i need the depakote to flatten out the cycling and the paxil to keep the anxiety under control it seems if i can keep the anxiety under control then the depakote can hold me steady if i let the fear take hold then i start back up the hypomanic train the trick for me is balacing paxil dose with stress,1
you need to find somewhere that you can detox safely especially from the klonopin i had a doctor abruptly take me off klonopin did not tell me that i could suffer seizures that could possibly kill me from this withdrawal and the withdrawal was absolutely horrible from what i understand the type of medication is one of the worst withdrawals almost,1
ive had a couple of them it is an all consuming feeling of fright i thank god i havent had any in forever it seems,0
my ex tried worked well but kept relapsinghelped with the anxiety and tremors,1
setting an alarm on my phone and always having them on me x,0
ah ok we didnt have access to music (cords can be used for asphyxiation) i missed having a support system after i got out i had to fend for myself again - in the hospital i just showed up to meals i missed having people that "got it" - we would be genuine in our laughter about our "inappropriate" jokes about where we were having very frank discussions about what brought us there etc i didnt have to hide anything - everything was on the table out in the open suicide attempts mania hearing voices sex addiction drug abuse things that were taboo in normal society were normal for us and i still miss that i miss being able to be myself even if it was depressed and scared and ashamed i never put on good graces there i miss being safe it took me about 3 weeks before i felt comfortable being on the outside talking to people and i still wasnt completely assimilated i definitely had to put on the happy face and say that i was doing ok (even though i definitely wasnt - one week in a hospital doesnt cure you it just gives you a safe place to start to heal) i dreaded going out to the mall (i just didnt) going grocery shopping (had to do it) running into friends ("havent heard from you in a while!" thats because i was in a psych ward)i physically felt like i needed to duck to avoidsomething i was off work for 6 weeks (and it would have been longer but i teach and it was the end of the year) and all anyone knew was that i was sick my staff was terrific and only 2 people knew where i was - it was the best kept secret ever in that building 2 people out of 120 i will never be able to re-pay that debt but getting back into the regular world was hard it takes time but it doesnt happen for me 3 days was just scratching the surface of my return into society,0
i set my alarm on my phone for all of the times i have to take my medication works for me,1
medications can get rid of bipolar symptoms but then bring on depression anxiety panic attacks etc no simple surgery can "fix" all that,1
haha dont worry the day might start off like that but i wouldnt let it end that way without trying my hardest <3 <3 xxxxxx,0
its hard having kids with bpd i also have a tbi ocd and gad but my manic and depressive stages are even harder with kids it can be done but sometimes its overwhelming and you cant take most your meds while pregnant so be careful there too,1
i have anxiety and depression and i get very moody a week prior,1
nah its just anxiety,0
it is so late for me now so not saying to much!this is what i keep saying the "so called normal people do the most stupid things in life"well a lot of us are very knowledgeable of things things because also of anxiety "where it comes to me"!,0
hi there im sharing you two beautiful links thats beneficial (1) to control your anger must start with in you sometimes you might become angry because you see only one aspect of the issue—the part that affects you try to consider the other side of the story theres usually an explanation that can help us show a little understanding” do you have access to the bible? please read this bible principle in proverbs 19:11 the wisdom in it might help you ❤️ here is the bible-based article related to your anger-problem situation (2) being shy it has to do with finding real friends and be a genuine friend to others usually helps a lot one of the short animated video from this link entitled: whats a real friend- might help you as well take care ❤️ ,1
first get a new doctor because a doctor thats telling you that its all in your head is a piece of shit second i take 1200mg of ibuprofen 3 times a day i know its a lot but thats what it takes when things get really bad like from my ra my doc will give me a single script of morphine or vicodin ive also found that weighted blankets are fabulous for body aches i have one that weighs 25 pounds and believe it or not it helps calm anxiety attacks too,1
i take 90mgs of cymbalta a day also valproate yes l do get a few tremors but l think it is quite normal after years of mis diagnosis and and a very miserable life a few tremors are nothing your gp should be able to find the right combination for you good luck,1
im bipolar 2 and have a 20 week old baby when i fell pregnant i went to see my dr to talk about my med we had a really good chat and spoke about the risks i already had 2 children that needed me so i decided to continue to take my med! god for 5mths my mood was really not good i nearly got taken into hospital now 20 weeks on im so glad i stayed on my medmy little girl was fine there wasnt any problems with her at all im on 250mg quetiapine and 100mg sertraline no-one can make your mind up but you they are risks with all med good luck and best wishes xx,1
i had an anxiety attack today and not all of those work,1
dont stress yourself over it think about the other things experience good things you have fallen too deep in you depression get out for someone shall never fall as deep andits the gravities right,0
same for me works great i really like it only anxiety/panic medicine thats ever worked for me,1
if you havent got a visible illness most people dont have a clue how you feel and think they have the right to think you dont have a disabled illness if you have a sudden panic attack/anxiety they cant see it and dont understand that you need to rush sometimes passed them to get a taxi immediately to get home but they think you are being rude think i need a tattoo on my forehead to let people know that i do have an illness xx,0
i was taking adderal and loved it felt more awake focused just alive however it made me very anxious and i became severely manic after being on it for just a short time i know it wasnt medication alone that made me manic seeing as how i am diagnosed bipolar 1 and manic episodes are just part of illness however i experienced a state of mania i had never experienced while i was off of it,0
yes!!!! heather welch lol people dont realize that we make change by talking about things openly and truthfully im so tired of the cannabis shaming i havent been able to do anything even leaving my apartment except once a week for therapy for 3+ years since ive gotten prescribed cannabis for my pain depression anxiety etc guess what? i went to the empire state building i have been able to go to eat at a restaurant among a few other things i havent been able to do in a long time or at all before and guess what? its all because of cannabis it annoys me so bad when people dont look at actual scientific evidence before making statements i feel like its a personal attack on me every time smh,0
yes completely i fear so much for the time im not here to care for him my son is 17 too and his anxiety can be crippling it is bad enough now for him but at least he has me to lean on and to help him but i am so worried about the future who will look after him when im not here? it almost makes life seem that much more fragile i think as parents we beat ourselves up all the time when we cant fix our children we dont have all the answers even though we are constantly wracking our brains trying to do our best im also trying to decide how to address the anxiety whether there is any effective therapy or medication to help with that as with my son and with your by the sound of it the anxiety is stopping them from living any form of normal life its heartbreaking to see them suffer they lose out on so much its so unfair i dont think many people understand how awful it is im sure you are doing a wonderful job its an ongoing dialogue between supporting them and not doing too much for them we can only do our best all we can do is gently encourage but a lot of the recovery or steps forward have to be governed by them they cant be pushed too far or too fast im sure you are doing a great job but the conditions are so difficult to deal with there are certainly no easy answers thats what makes it all so frustrating i hope you have others to help you perhaps to allow your son lean on others too to share the load from you and for him to be able to trust others enough so he can become a little less dependent on you because i know it can be exhausting best of luck to you both xx,0
i have also struggled with depression dated a shrink gone to shrinks taken thier meds  played thier game nothing worked until i began to see the huge conspiracy that was causing my depression i have overcome depression with no help from the pros  but from my own critical analysis of what is going on along with honest feedback i am willing to tell more if you like,1
i tried sooooooo hard to stay out of hospitalwhen i finally sucumbedno bedsleft my friend to care for meembarrassing! keep soldiering ongo for that walkstop and smell the roses resttry and eat welleven smoothieswe can do it!,0
husband is on propranolol im on gabapentin 3/day and clonazepam clonazepam knocks me out so i can only use it at bedtime since i was waking up with horrible panic/anxiety attacks (and im not any longer) it obviously worked for that,1
i think ive said this a thousand times before unless you have a diagnosis of mental illness or a doctor youll never understand the way the person feels somewhere along the line my heart has hardened although my family is supportive there are many who have left me for dead in their lives including my biological father nobody asks for this dont be ashamed of your tears you have every right to express your pain be blunt tell them exactly what they are doing n how it makes you feel if it continues you need to seek support somewhere else family should allways be there for you that being said respect yourself enough to get the support you deserve for the record i am bipolar 2 border line personality disorder and schizoaffective,0
bless your heart im scared all the time you can make it through this,0
not an rn but lpn of 15 yrs and my last day of work was may 12thof last year i literally snapped at work that morning and quit my job after being trigger by things said by my don i have since applied for my soc sec disability because of my anger issues that i cant seem to controlaswellasmy anxietythat ihavein a social situation i tooloved my job but i cant begin to imagine going backto it yet if ever i have since lost so much self confidence and self esteem i truly know where your coming from i have so damned many diagnosis i literally lost everything i had in feb of this year and am currently living with a family member that dont understand my issues and is verbally mean i pray to get out soon i will pray for you as well,0
i have type 2 with anxiety and am on xanax aswell i was on valluim but went down hill quick a doc that specialist in this told me that the valluim runs off the same receptor in the brain as the bipolar disorder medication hence going down hill but i find this works for me but each person is different hope this helps,1
i went to a center for mental health and substance abuse (place for either or both issues) which was the real beginning of getting myself under control they have counselors who i found were non judgmental not pushy and there for you to talk anytime they have a huge range of resources and support all types group meeting with people dealing with similar issues they help you to understand yourself more and come up with solutions that are right for you its always a good idea to talk to your doctor or a psychiatrist but i found the mental health center to be the best support you are in control its all about trying new things a good try keep whats good pass on whats not for you you can do it! i know its overwhelming and its hard to get a ball rolling but it will get better and you will enjoy life as you find yourself more❤,0
i did but just like any other antidepressant i didnt respond well to it and made me more depressed ive never had a good response to antidepressants and a psychiatrist from the hospital said she would never give them to me because my symptoms would not be a good fit for them anxiety and mania medications work wonders for me and balance out my depression antipsychotics have the same reactions as antidepressants they all sedate me 24/7 so that i cant function,0
melissa mayes thank you for telling me your story & for your thoughts & prayers i will find out on wednesday what my doctor feels is the best way forward but i do know that i have only 3 options as i mentioned above which involve either taking oestrogen during my periods going onto hrt or lastly a full hysterectomy (including the ovaries) then hrt id be a fool if i didnt admit that im scared but i do know that something has to be done i cannot continue this way,0
all i know if it wasnt for the lord i would have gassed my self but he stepped in and took control of my fears and paranoia which was very bad at that time i also has a character that i created for my self when i was in mania her name was because she is also laid to rest now in any case i called her the white princess of africa it had to do with my faith he set me free from what person i created,1
my heart breaks for you sending you love light and healing from south africa i am also living a nightmare with severe depression and anxiety an the lack of understanding and empathy by those around me never ceases to shock mehow i wish i was terminally ill then id know my hell would end soon,0
please sweetheart dont give up i feel your pain i was at the end of dealing with things after a lifetime of torture my sister took her life in a very violent way her babies and i walked in after she did it after twenty years i still have awful panic attacks horrible flashbacks and an awful amount of guilt her boys have suffered horribly too even after witnessing all of that trauma i still was in so much agony that i just wanted the pain to end but you know i have fought and worked to get the right docs to help me please reach out for help i promise you that things can get better when you least expect it i had absolutely zero hope i was wishing to die it really does get better you know i too didnt want my meds to increase but sometimes like in my case that is what had to happen just until you are stable maybe please realize that you are someone special the world wouldnt be as good without you in it please you owe it to yourself and you are worth fighting for if you want to friend me on facebook i would be honored to be there for you in anyway i have very few people in my life that get it please reach out for help,0
please reach out for help life is so short ive known people who have taken their own lives and its such a waste of life it effects everyone left behind to grieve ive been in and out of depression since i was a child and suffer from extreme anxiety i have my bad days but the power of positive thinking helps me get through when i struggle to care about myself i think back to when i was a little kid and i couldnt bring myself to hurt her so i hang in there ,0
i know as impossible as it may seem right now these feelings/thoughts will not last forever dont give up as hard as it is to feel this miserable you have to take it one day at a time hang on to one thing you have to live for for me it was my kids even though i truly believed with everything in me that they would be better off without me the pain they would live with kept me breathing never give up ,0
seems like anxiety symptoms,1

ive struggled with my weight for years and im not even five foot  its so depressing im fed up with being overweight  its hard  been difficult on my self esteem and self image,0
i take lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine for bipolar psychosis and anxiety yes they mean weight gain over the past 3 yrs ive managed to lose 35kg ( not sure what that is in pounds) which isnt a lot but its still a loss i replace breakfast and lunch with diet shakes in particular optifast which i really like) and i have a small dinner trying to avoid carbs if possible i have chronic pain as well so moving is very painful but i manage to walk 2 20 min blocks 5 days a week to and from work and the train station im lucky that i have no choice to walk if i want to work its difficult and can be demotivating at times but it is possible take care,1
i am sorry to here that i take it for anxiety and depression and hot flashes i take 150 mg a day,1

docs have tried hard for so many years finally settled on anti anxiety and sedatives now im a zombie,0
there is no doubt from your words you are pretty desperate and struggling to cope i guess many questions come to mind such as do you have parents? are they aware of your mental health problems? if they do are they supportive? also do you have a good doctor? i guess you may be in the us while im in the uk where doctors are readily and freely available and you can change around until you find the best for you when i was really in a bad way (unfortunately im way older but there are still similarities) plus my teenage son has had acute anxiety and depression my brother too when i was ill i was adamant i wouldnt take sleeping tablets see a counsellor or go onto anti depressant medication i wouldnt even admit to start with that i had depression until i ended up on the edge of a breakdown and knew for my sake as well as my families something had to change i have had a lot of problems with staff at my sons high school pushing him and had an email recently adding more pressure saying he was going to fail his exams and wouldnt be able to continue next year this approach is not helping applies more pressure on him when he is already not coping and makes him feel a failure some of the things hes told me how he feels over the years are heartbreaking things you never want to hear as a mother but im so relieved tho he can tell me and i want to know how he feels so i can help accordingly i have explained to him its not about failing or succeeding if his exam results arent great then i d like him to be able to think he hasnt achieved quite as well as hed hoped but thats not a problem its not insurmountable and really it doesnt matter there is so much pressure here and probably similar there on our young people to succeed in their studies its far too much pressure on their young shoulders as a society we need to back off gently encourage and be kind im sure this would be far more affective than frightening and bullying them mental illness isnt being stupid weak or a failure our brains are the most complex organ like other parts of our bodies sometimes they dont work so well we all need a helping hand from time to time and until the world takes mental illness seriously and stop being unkind impatient and not understanding then thousands and thousands of people suffer in relative silence its all wrong reach out hun tell those who love you how you really feel if they truly love you they will understand its not for you to make them they have the responsibility to understand and to help look again at small but significant steps to make you better do you need something to help your bad periods? are they causing deficiencies in your body? medication can be a temporary crutch to help you get back on track during a particularly busy time can you talk to your lecturer? jot down some notes so you dont forget im sure your mind might be completely jumbled how can you study effectively when you feel like this im not telling you what to do just looking at options support is one of the most important things along with consideration and kindness you need people to give you a break but if they arent aware of the full facts then they might not be able to help properly dont push loved ones away with depression we can feel so alone but we also try to isolate ourselves too thinking of you and hold on to hope that it will get better there is always hope look after yourself x,0
also id research that 30% thing that sounds like a random bs number its a crap shoot if your kids get it and ive always been told youre at a higher risk of getting it if it runs in your family so id say thats prob higher than 30% i may very much be wrong but i dont think they really know,0
dbt is dialectical behavioral therapy it helps people that have a hard time regulating their moods and emotions often have feelings of abandonment suicidal thoughts or ideas long-term depression anxiety karma ptsd feeling like your life is just existing its a certain set of skills that you learn several different ones to help change these thoughts to more positive ways im sure if you google borderline personality disorder or dbt it can explain it better than i can,1
thats a shame jessica because if you have a disorder that causes you to need it and are not abusing it you should be helped my doctor is a really good listener i was diagnosed with severe depression and severe anxiety panic disorder he wanted me on xanax but because of the junkies xanax has been removed from australia and doctors do not give out xanax but im really really bad so he wants me on increased dosages of valium he said it may take up to 5 each day to just calm me down my doctor cares and listens and a good doctor will look at your history your diagnosis previous suicide attempts (they look over everything) and look at you today and tell you what you will need if he/she flat out said no thats not very good if she gave a reason well yeah its a hard one yes certain prescribed drugs are addictive but under the watchful eye of a good doctor and regular visits and taking them as prescribed for your condition you are safe because the doc can ween you off safely when its time so sorry your having a shit time candy,1
lithium is an old medication and i am surprised by how many people are on it lithium is very hard on the kidneys sorry for your loss and the horrible way it went its a shocker epilim is also a mood stabiliser like lithium and causes zero damage to the kidneys and no side effects to me i strongly suggest that you give epilim a go bipolar people tend to need medication to help them manage it when i tried a vitimin therapy that did not work i bounced from one disaster to the next !,1
dont be afraid the demons arent real its just your brain misfiring,0
so well said but after soso so long i am getting tired and more tired of getting up and down all night long to the same outcome meeting me in the morningn carring me through the same pattern in the day and then bringing on the night only to be paniced sadened and know if tomorrow comes in my house the outcome will be the same bleek anxiety/panic as it has been no matter what has been taken given talked about on and on an on,0
i messed up my first script on a small dose and took 2 a day instead of 1 and was left with 3 days with no pills thought i was dying of the flu horrible withdrawal my doc doesnt want to give me anything else for my anxiety and bpd at the moment so im hoping this helps,0
im trying to keep a promise made after my last failed attempt each day is a struggle days filled with pain sorrow and yes despair pray for all who must fight this fight pray for me,0
yes it will get better the times of hormonal changes are always super hard being a teenager makes ya kinda bipolar anyway!!! my best friend was diagnosed and medicated from 15 until just a few years ago i worry about her not taking meds and im not saying youll get to that point but shes not had a major mid swing in about five years five years!!! depression keeps you from seeing hope but its still there,0
im fearful of a super-low next oh the joys of this disorder!,0
actually isnt that a buddhist belief? now what you said is indeed true thinking about and worrying about the future can lead to anxiety just as living in the past can bring about depression the thing is we are extremists and anything or sometimes nothing can trigger these reactions,0
it made me forget everything my short term memory was all wacky it was horrible i got off of it quickly good luck,0
are they real or are people telling you theyre not real? just asking because i know someone who thinks their memories are real and they are horrific i would never imagine anyone going through these situations and they are so real to this person theyve found peace with god over the horrific situations however they still struggle daily,0
wow effexor is fantastic for bipolar and depression zero side effects when first taking it but dont forget to take it you will get little head zaps and dizzy spells im currently going through it as i type this message not that i forgot to take it i just dont have the money until tomorrow to fill my script its horrible ,1

different for everyone for me with depression and anxiety i noticed it was working after about a month on my depression honestly it may have been a slight *contributor* to my anxiety (but to be fair my anxiety meds werent helping either) not on it now but if my depression got bad i would be willing to try it again and for women (idk if common or not) but my dr would have me increase dosage temporarily before cycling that month,1

lamictal/lamotrigine was the best medication i ever tried i picked it myself its an anticonvulsant that seconds as a mood stabilizer so theres minimal risk unfortunately i got bad physical side effects after a while but mentally it worked i still highy recommend it,1
meds are half of it a person must do the work to get well ive been suffering from mental illness for more than half my life now and i can tell you i was where shes at it will be uncomfortable but to get better you have to do what it takes i went to counswling and a counselor that could problem solve not just listen to me be a victim of the world i learned everything i could and am still learning about my mental illness i have learned how to cope some days are still hard but i want to be a productive member of society so i do what it takes yes im on meds and yes they help never give up! :),0
my husband whos very scientific struggles with understanding my daughters mental illness but one thing he does not dispute is that she is the best mom her illness has made her even more accepting and compassionate to peoples needs and differences it took him some time in counseling to open his eyes let your therapist and dr help you make your decision bless you,0
to have to struggle with myself so much you have to have a spine or grow nuts its a survival mechanism! its always one thing or another brave i have to be,0
if taking a medication improves the quality of your life and sanity then you should take it especially with a low dosage you would be recommended to take most drs are against medications during pregnancy especially for mental issues they look at a chart and immediately insist it is a terrible idea if you or your doctor have any concerns a specialist will be likely recommended they have trained staff that measure and track all growth fluids etc regularly i lowered my dosages of some of my medications and immediately resumed the normal level after my child was born my child was healthy and i was better able to take care of her benefit vs risk if you are able to deal with your illness without medication then obviously do it but you do not have to suffer unnecessarily because of pressure or fear your child will not have withdrawals or lasting impacts from that - but the rammifications of discontinuing a medication pregnant can effect your ability to adequately care for and bond with your baby it isnt noble or more responsible or more natural or whatever kind of misinformation will say to suffer,1
first youre never beyond help second ive been on lithium for years and years and my first year of being on it was horrible but it does get better and then you learn that your body needs it and you feel good about taking it and it really helps just make sure you get your blood checked every three months it will get better stick with it,0

those are all common symptoms of anxiety medication helps many people exercise helps boost medication ensuring you eat good foods and sleep enough helps your body be healthy ask your doctor about medication ask your friends to exercise with you ask the people you live with to help make sure you eat properly and dont sleep all day practicing mindfulness helped me move forward with my illnesses but it works better in conjunction with all of the things ive listed,1
as a nami volunteer i got to go speak to 5 different middle school health classes! about mental health how i went from agoraphobic to going to a university- it was a blast we also explained the different illness and where to get help! though i am graduating tomorrow with my ba in business i actually want to enter the fiction arena with the truth of mental health showing positives and some negatives that help us overcome! we are a special people smart creative and hell of a strong group of people we have to be we fight our own brains everyday when i was told i needed a heart transplant this year on my 42nd birthday actually i smiled and said " ok now where do we start so i can get better!" i know depression this caused me to be angry i am back to training for my second degree and my instructor certification the only thing that stops me- is me now i do listen to my body i have more breaks and dont push it all that is through mental health and the struggles i had with it three doctors told me i was stupid! i wish i can find them and invite them to my graduation when i get my ba!! lol,1

i am at the end stage of my bout now the last week i have driven myself and my boyfriend insane to such a point he was hurting because of my reaction i feel like a different person and i cannot stop it or be logical because there is no real reason for my own head just a guess a cycle going round and round until i crack i am going to doctors tomorrow as the pattern is formed and see it happening even before it started with that in mind if i see it unfolding why cant i stop it because its ruining all aspects of my life anxious afraid nervous my confidence my working life and my social life really need help im 37 now and feel stupid for feeling so pathetic my head is a horrible place to be in sometimes,0
thats me every day no matter what i do it is never good enough i try and i fail at least my daughters can see that i am making the effort to change so i am making a difference to somebody i just have to see it in myself make more positive changes do the right thing get right with god be positive and dont be afraid to smile,0
i do not believe suicide is selfish if a person has suffered for a long time with the overwhelming depliltating side effects of depressionand medication therapy group therapy hospital stays and ect has not worked than why should they have to spend their life suffering to keep others happy,1
ha ha if i stopped my meds that would be the time for them to start worrying,1
i wasnt diagnosed until after id had my children they are both fine and well adjusted children (18 and 13) they know about my illness and i have always been honest with them about it i think the one good thing about having the illness is that of either of them had of inherited it from me then they would have been diagnosed a lot sooner than i was as we know the symptoms and also as we have experience of it then they could be helped and understood more nobody else in my family has this illness but i dont think that knowing i had it would have put me off from having them obviously i would have been concerned about passing it on to them as i wouldnt wish it on anyone but if you decide that you want children then this horrible illness shouldnt stop you as there is no guarantee that they will get it whatever you decide in the long term i wish you all the best ☺️,0
i get paralyzed i seriously cant move or think can barely speak totally weird does anyone else have anxiety attacks that manifest like this?,0
i have a wonderful healthy son i was diagnosed 5 years before we chose to vet pregnant i was very stable then i have a supportive husband that helps a lot during those times of major depression but because i have my boy it makes it easier to keep pushing through also during pregnancy i consulted very seriously with all my doctors about my meds we all decided that it was safer for me to stay on them than risk an episode during pregnancy my son was born with slight symptoms of withdrawal but other wise completely healthy has been 100% fine since birth i fell like we made the right choice for our family,1
if youre bipolar 1antidepressants will send you into a suicidal state of mind just be aware of that also research has proven that there is a higher probability that ssris and antipsychotic meds will effect your baby its a risk,1

it comes at night good idea horrible execution,0
this this and this so afraid,0
wow right now you need him more than ever struggling with depression and anxiety is not easy and when your supposed support network deals a blown like this it makes you so so much worse yes being in a relationship with someone who has depression and anxiety can be hard but if you love that person unconditionally and are committed to them then you go above and beyond to try to understand and help them does he not think that if you just be "normal" (fyi i bloody hate that term but you know what i mean) then youd do it in a heart beat? depression and anxiety are debilitating theres no two ways about it quite frankly if he cant support you in the way you need and you dont fit his so called "perfect" ideal is this really a healthy relationship to be in?,0
a daily struggle,0
yes! my father had manic depression in the 50s diagnosis and treatment was little he had no treatment and unfortunately turned to alcohol he went out and robbed a bank in a manic state got 10 years he committed suicide when i was 15 my mother had anxiety and depression tracing back to my family there were quite a few cases aswell i was diagnosed 12 years ago and after a few hospital stays i gratefully got the treatment i needed my daughter has inherited bipolar and is also under good care and treatment my phyciatrist is convinced it runs in families,1
to leave can be very hard and it can be for some time whatever you do be safe first and then surround yourself with people who will help you be strong and go through the process of becoming separate in your mind from him you can love someone and not be with them you can pray for him and not let him be able to harm you any more god is good pray and read comforting bible verses go to church for comfort and to get strong and close to goddont be afraid but be strong~ and be safe,0
seek out a good holistic dr they will guide you please dont be scared off by all this interactions not to mention there are better things than st johns wart st johns wart is heavily advertised but its not the only nor best natural anti-depressant,0
i understand it makes you feel crappy but you shouldnt stop taking it a lot of medication can have negative side effects but after taking them for a couple weeks and they get in your system and your body adjusted the side effects will go away but now since youve stopped them you wont know if they are going to help you or not one of the meds im on actually i had horrible side effects when i started them! i was having nightmares i was throwing up just thinking about food and i even pissed the bed 3 nights in a row!! i told my doctor about it right away and said i cant handle this! he told me to please take them for 2 weeks after 1 week and 2 days those side effects started slowing down and after 3 weeks i havent had any side effects at all! they all went away completely! ive been on this med for 4 months now and its by far the best medication that ive ever been on in the past 20 years!!! just my advice a little food for thought ~dani,0
do not make a decision until you feel stabilized i would also discuss this with a supportive individual therapist or doc all mine tell me that my partner is creating an atmosphere that makes my disease worse in a cyclic manner so i may feel better for a bit and then crash again repeat (abusive) he controls everything and it is scary! i have not been stable for a long time - years,0
i thinkblargh which is like blah ugh tired overwhelming and guilt,0
there is the 4/7/8 yoga breathing that is also taught by a leading doc you can look it up on the internet i also found several relaxing sound apps that are free in the app store that might help see if you can write down any memes on cards or put them on your phone that can remind you to breathe do you have worry beads? they are easy to make or maybe a calming cloth i found the softest baby yarn and crochet a small square that i will rub on my face or in my hands or a new one is try to ground yourself and go through your senses what do you see? what do you hear? what do you smell? what do you feel? do you feel your feet on the ground? can you feel yourself breathing? im sure there are more that others will or have added,1
help but probably most of all understanding and support i want the stupid panic attacks to stop i want people that really care about me and not just say it so they feel better i want a dad that isnt constantly confusing and hurting me maybe a bf or gf that does answer my texts and is there for me when i need him and not just start a conversation and immediatly goes away after i want a friend that doesnt try to kill me and people that stop hurting me and pushing me back because im coming out as trans my depression got better but my anxiety worse,0
your anxiety is because you have put your body in danger never stop your meds please rethink this choice,1
stephanie thank you for again reminding me that i am sick unfortunately the rest of life doesnt stop just because of an illness and personally i want to overcome it which means learning to cope with problems not excusing them i was specifically asking for help on the housing relationship and dating situation which i admitted my responsibility of bad thinking and where it was coming from continuing to ignore problems that include other people only makes them worse i didnt need to be told i was worrying about everyone else when i was actually worrying about myself being homeless and alone wondering if you actually read what i wrote? at least you got me working on my junk again! now if only i can figure out how to face it! ,0
i was the same at 16/17 and i found once my mum and dad stopped over compensating for me i really had to push my self and get on with things ive now had the same job for one year and im doing driving  i still struggle with anxiety and my mood disorder everyday but i know when i feel crap i might not feel the same tomorrow  there are lots of anxiety treatments  light therapy  cbt i listen to music every night on youtube for anxiety there are also anxiety apps on iphone and android that are very good as it works when asleep your ears are the only thing that dont sleep at night  so it is gradual and you might not nessacerily notice any changes at first ,1
i dont like the sharknado moviethey are horrible but i have a ten year old who loves them,0
i have bipolar 1 and i had psychosis twice i had to be hospitalized twice i was very paranoid and was thought to be schizophrenic at the first hospital ive been properly medicated for almost a year and a half and havent had any delusions since being hospitalized my parents had to call the cops on me the 2nd time,1
i have researched ect and have found that in a lot of cases this form of treatment can cause extreme damage both short term and long term to the brain while this doesnt happen in every case the risk is still to high for me to consider as my mind is really all i have,1
this is the best way i have seen this horrible disorder described ever its hard some days its harder but we pay the price always when we come back down from our highs and wish we could just crawl under a huge rock because we are so filled with guilt please dont judge be more understanding,0
my agoraphobia is similar to your husbands fear level i take effexor and rexulti they help me stay present and unafraid most of the time your husband should absolutely talk to a psychiatrist about panic disorder and any signs of ptsd or c-ptsd,1
sometimes medication isnt always the answers i used to struggle to sleep most nights  brain over thinking to many things  or id fall asleep and then have a disturbed sleep maybe wake up to 6 times  i always try go bet at the same time as it gets me into a routine (like you would as a child) then i listen to music on youtube  music for anxiety  music for insomnia  theres so many  and some of them play for the whole 8 hours and i find there the ones that help me stay asleep  if they are just quick ones that send you off and only last 40 mins im up again within two hours  your ears are the only thing that dont sleep  i found this really helped me along side taking my mood stabilisers and anxiety tablets,1
this scares me to deathbut i can feel it starting up again and after reading this i just know its a matter of time now im so tired of fighting everyday already i cant even imagine it getting worse again,0
its a every day struggle,0
im on board with honesty and trustwithout which i dont think you have any chance of making it work i have bpd and "bipolar tendencies" whatever the hell that is lol my partner of almost 20 years has bipolar disorder we tattooed trust on ourselves in someplace we see at the beginning to make sure we never forgot our commitment to making it the foundation of our relationship then we spent the next 20ish years being completely honest with one another we might not always like what each of us has to say but the honesty helps keep things transparent these disorders will complicate your life enoughdont add anything else in the mix that would confuse or complicate the relationship that being said you can understand the demons each other faces better than a "healthy person" you can sympathize with the issues your partner faces youll be proud of their success because youll know what it cost the only thing sometimes youll have to put a disagreement or discussion off till later because when the disorder is running the show u cant have a rationale conversation u have to wait till your partner is back in charge to have some talks i wouldnt want to live without my bipolar partner im grateful every day we were willing to take a chance on us! love always !!! ✨❤✨ ✨❤✨,0
well my dear you are not alone! i have them all myself and often feel like a juggling act! all my kids and grandkids are grown so i dont have to worry about little ones i hate the manic state of the bi-polar depression sometimes i am there for a couple weeks i have been on mood stabilizers for a while now my dr increased my dose by 25 mg i could tell the difference within a week it is called lamactil stopped the hamster wheel in my brain was having horrible panic attacks so it helped that as well i would go from 1 extreme to another so maybe talk to your dr or psychiatrist! i take a lot of other meds relating to my other illneses had brain surgery and life has never been the same but know you are not alone out there my friend,0
but for many it does work if any medication is causing an issue you have to address that with your psych doctor and yes i know its hard sometimes i have bipolar 1 anxiety ptsd and personality disorder bipolar since childhood,1
of course youre scared so much has happened in the last few weeks and days you can pm me if you want,0
i totally agree with michelle here manuel its prescribed and certainly a powerful drug and therefore abused quite frequently definitely follow directions carefully and never exceed the limit prescribed trust me i know from experience i once was so depressed and anxious that i took all 3 of my pills at once (theyre supposed to be spread out every 6 hours) and ended up so sleepy that i fell asleep for the entire day ive also read that it can cause memory loss which i havent experienced but definitely something to be aware of good luck :),0
tell him its something he needs to know if he doesnt already but its an awesome feeling when ya got somebody to help you through your meltdowns providing they can handle your mood swings but after 2 years im sure he has some idea i told my current partner before we actually got together after coming out of a bad relationship with a guy who made me feel soo guilty for my thoughts n cutting n meltdowns,0
i had zoloft and heard voices and screaming on my ear especially when i was trying to sleep i also used to see shadows and things flying horrible,1

i take it for nerve damage my anxiety is still shit tho,1
imma big girl and my mood stabilizer is topamax it helpsto curb your appetite you might want to talk to your doctor about it if your worried about weight i understand about the stress and depression of weight gain i have a lot of medical problems as well they play a big part in my weight but to make a long story shirt i once had lost alot of weight and was thin and have gain it all back plus alot and now i cant get it off no matter what i do but the topamax has helped with the not eating all the time which helps me to atleast not gain more weight i would highly recommend not going off all med completely tho they arent miracle pills but they help out brains work the way they should things can get scary when not on meds ive been there i hope whatever you do you find some happiness and peace,1

hi i have bipolar 1 as does my sister and mother i remember back in 2012 when i was convinced my teeth were falling out i could feel every single one of them moving when i spoke when i ate the only way i can describe my mood throughout that episode was utter terror all day everyday i didnt eat i examined my teeth i went to 4 different dentists and 2 gps (before diagnosis ) i ended up trying to ply them out if my mouth until i was sedated with diazepam  the only way i coped at times was to distract myself with painting  i cant explain it but it really helps medont get me wrong the anxiety creeps through always  the other day i was on a low i got really overdramatic about the price of fags and how its not fair to do this to me bla bla bipolar blaaaaanyway i made this through spite and it went viralwhich sent me into a hypo and i painted the whole flat bipolar is weird lol xxx,0
this is something that has caused me a lot of pain and struggle and if i ever mentioned it to therapists or psychiatrists they either wrote it off or blamed me for lack of self control this is why its important to have a good therapist,1
i do occasionally when i know im going to be somewhere i could end up having an anxiety attack i take 2 i live in a rural area so i have to drive pretty much everywhere like i said ive never had any issues but everyone reacts differently,0
i would wean off the ambien and valium they increase your risk of alzheimers by 60percent they also affect short term memory,1
top bipolar med is lithium some others are abilify seroquel  lamictal and saphris(personal favorite) a lot of anti psychotics like geodon are also prescribed for bipolar disorder if the depression is a main concern they may add on a med specific to depression such as zoloft or prozac clonazepam is also known an klonopin which is a benzodiazepine (helps anxiety almost immediately) works wonders for sure,1
anyone experience relationship guilt? you just cant be happy and vibrant like your partner and know she needs/ deserves someone like thathow do you deal with thisknowing she was happier before she met you?,0
and from the outside its hard for those who care to tell that its happening to those with anxiety then there is the person who is dependent on one person (as is my down syndrome daughter) to take care of them and knows that when that person is gone its very likely that one one else will really give a damn about them that is not anxiety that is real and tragic and there is no cure or pill for real combine the 2nd situation with anxiety and its crushing,0

thank you dre wag and amanda austin for the kind words we are all dealing with this horrible disease we should band together not tear each other apart its hard enough coping with life and people who have no clue what we go through daily im sorry if i hurt anyones feelings i didnt mean too,0
works great for mine but everyone is different and yes it is an antihistamine but antihistamines treat more than just allergies they also help with nausea insomnia and anxiety as well i like that i dont have to take it if im having a good day and i also like that if i start feeling anxious i can take it and it works fairly quickly my anxiety is pretty well controlled without meds most of the time but this med saves me when it gets bad,1
that was my entire month last month would just cry for no reason thankfully i had seroquel added with my abilify and ive been doing much better with my anxiety/manic episodes,1
ive been trying to deal with my cricket phobia for years,0

if i may ask what medications are you on? i am on zyprexa prozac and lamictal and do you go to therapy not just a psychiatrist? i have been where youre at and it is horrible feeling the best i know to do is to keep going to therapy and getting my thoughts and my feelings out,0
i think unfortunately we live in an age where its easier and more common to ask for advice on a social media page rather than get correct information from a professional health care worker i see so many people asking for help or advice on medications on facebook and i cant help but to think "why dont you just ask a psychiatrist" sadly i think this is due to the fact that many people all across the world do not have easy or affordable access to mental health professionals australia nz usa and many more countries i have lived in have very poor support for people with mental health issues my advice is this always check with a doctor before changing dosage or stopping any medication i know that many medications can cause increased risk of depression anxiety or suicidal thoughts but there are also many that dont it takes time to find the right medication sometimes and it can be a tedious process i also am a suicide survivor and speaking for myself i wouldnt be here without my medications keep fighting the good fight people !,1
i deal with bipolar depression and anxiety myself its a very hard combo to deal with but i get up everyday somedays wishing i didnt and get dressed and do my best to make it through the day if for no other reason than to prove to myself i still can,1
yeah i feel that way everyday i avoid mirrors and cameras because they always seem to see the sad part of me i hate not feeling normal and it seems like no one understands that and when i teach out for help because i feel like im having s mental breakdown in told i cant have one because i have a family that needs mebut how do you stop it?,0
never heard of a therapist saying such crazy stuff like the one you seen any educated therpist should be able to understand and help let the new therpaist know all your feeling as its all real and a struggle good luck,0
my job is extremely physically strenuous people think as the day goes on that im just getting tired i suppose im lucky that thats a logical excuse but its really because my anxiety escalates as the day goes on only a couple people at work know about my battle with depression but only one who i really trusted to tell knows about the anxiety it really is painful to hide it,0
im the same way it sucks n the anxiety bout dying sucks!!,0
not going out it part of being mentally ill i am in utah and was told cause i was not following the gospel was all my problems being a addict and mentally is ok you need to just try to treat both i did best just making sure no matter what i would not use drugs i drop of the map no one i use drugs with could find me in my new apt deleted all their numbers and fully dedicadef no drugs you will feel the most benifit of your meds maybe want to go out or just feel better inside but dont ever let anyone judge you i was going to na but gave me anxiety had friend that went i was put on adderal and she look down on me i thought she is not in my head and blew her off,0
but seriously at least here in the states we are so repressed about sex i can see how this would be a problem no one want to talk about sex i mean unless they are bragging or something it is weird how we handle sex in the states it isnt handled in a healthy way by anyone even the mentally healthy,0
i was hospitalized 15 days through police intervention the doctor finally told me to answer just the questions directly as he was trying to decide if i was depressed or bipolar i am bipolar with depression that does not mean i dont have manic episodes also steve wajda is correct bipolar meds are a combination of many types some with harsh side effects and costly previously for 25 years my diagnosis was chronic depression with anxiety i eventually became someone who i did not know existedvery angry and destructive along with manic spending sprees my children became afraid of me as i look back at my history i can identify times when i was definitely showing symptoms of bipolar severe your awareness is a positive attribute and do not give up on getting the proper diagnosis and help be persistent have someone close to you verify your situation also with your psychiatrist or therapist my husband did for me (though i hated him at the time for doing so),1
effexor caused a suicide attempt for me and the brain zaps from withdrawing from the medication were horrible this drug should be taken off the market it only makes things worse in the end,1
ive been there and struggling again too so i do understand,0
im sorry to hear that maybe some cbd oil would help i know it has helped me there is no thc in cbd oil that might trigger him im bipolar 2 ptsd and severe anxiety,1
i have suffered from depression ptsd and severe anxiety i can find it very difficult to leave the house and cant do the simplest of tasks like washing ive been suicidal in the past,1
type 2 can also be manic and depressive at the same time that is when i honestly feel like i am going crazy and i truly need to watch my suicidal thoughts if i had the studys link i would post it but for every manic episode in a type 1 there are around 4 depressive episodes for type 2 that ratio becomes 1:40 type 1 manic is also more in the "normal" range than a type 1s both types are horrible though i dont wish them on anyone unfortunately my son has it too and is rapid cycling like i am,0
or give you ptsd anxiety problems clinical depression dissociative identity disorder etc,1
distract yourself by doing simple things like colouring reading watching a movie or researching research cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness they are therapies and techniques used by psychologists and psychiatrists to treat depression and anxiety you might find some ideas you can try there are even mindfulness apps you can download you need to see your dr and let them know you arent doing well you cant just snap out of it it takes a lot of hard work but its worth it,1
i got stephen johnson syndrome horrible,1
i am so glad to hear you were able to connect with a group and then a few individuals! this is so important isolation is not a good thing i am struggling with this myself,0
been treated for depression anxiety and bipolar for awhile now meds and therapy have worked until recently seems like meds are working as well i switched to a new med and its been better both bipolar and bpd characteristics fit how i am,1
tamara edie-jenkins it helps allot i also suffer social anxiety disorder it helps with both as well as my insomnia tried to cute smoking before i got the card but it didnt work to well my mood was everywhere my therapist even recommended me to continue to smoke because its the only thing she sees that works for me theres 4 types i have to take cbd meds which has very little thc and another which both i take orally those are for my bipolar depression then two types of oil vie the vapor pen which one is to take before bed and the other for my anxiety so i would definitely recommend it for someone who has tried everything but havent found anything that helps,1
i feel the same way sometimes i dont think people understand how hard it is having this bipolar disorder trying to function day to day can be a struggle our minds need a break,0
i wish i only had anxiety,1
i am sorry to hear of your troubles there is so many of us out there but are afraid to speak thank you for your story i am sorry you have to go through this,0
i dont im a pretty responsible independent person without alarms,0
sometimes we can be so afraid of things "getting worse" that we dont do the things that can help us get better -- the problem with ignoring trauma is what we wont deal with doesnt go away it will only make things worse and worse over time you can do this!,0
yes you are definitely right clarissa anderson i had to try so many meds to get my mood/anxiety right its a very hard struggle but you can overcome it!,1
i use to have that problem but now im on tygretol and wellbutrin and a new anti psychotic called sulfris not sure if i spelt that right and have had no weight gain issues there is no associated weight gain with any of those and they work very well my diagnosis goes between bi polar and schizo effective with agoraphobia and high anxiety but those meds seem to keep me very stable i was over 300lbs and yes i had help losing 175 of it but since then and the new meds ive had no issues with weight gain,1
id sit here and say how sorry i am for you but that would do you a disservice this is your life the hand has been dealt its time to call and show your cards thats the thing though show others your hand talk about what hurts defining your feelings is difficult im sure but you can describe the emptiness the loneliness and im not just talking about a therapist tell everyone in your life i know how terrifying that prospect can be but just think about it for a moment you live with fear every day fear of your own thoughts your urges or simply interacting with others the fear here is being judged but even if you were would that really be worse? theres a saying almost a mantra for us "no one is harder on me than me" so really what damage can telling people how much your suffering and how little control you have? you torture yourself far more than any hurtful judgmental comments however maybe just maybe youll find someone who gets it maybe your support system will grow the people who get your pain but instead of telling you to get out of bed and deal with it they lie down next to you and hold you sometimes love and support can be just as effective as meds,0
absolute fear sucked i was mad,0
if you can replace that job with a similar type of job with hours there are more suitable to your needs at please do it that job will kill you and all the stress is not helping your sensitive issue,1
the color purple i was too young when i saw it and it scared me and my sister,1
i struggle every day i am getting better though,0
yep same hear i have to get someone to come to the doctors and even then i often cant go i constantly cancel things and avoid the phone door ect,0
i cried all day every day on it  i was a mess it was horrible,0
i hated zoloft though it never did that to me im on whats called an off-label drug meaning the pill is meant for one thing but they noticed in patients it was also helping with anxiety ive been on 100mgs of lamotrigine and very little side effects and no weight gain for sleep (insomnia) i use trazadone its actually for depression and im happy with these,1
serious anxiety seriously hurts,1
first of all- you are amazing - you did the best u could at the time and her health was your main concern/priority thats love - period nobody likes inpatient care especially mental health but she needed you and you showed up and stepped up dont doubt yourself on that decision im so sorry she is suffering and you are feeling helpless find a good counselor for you similar to aa people who love those with mental illness need support too- and thatll help u to feel more confident about caring for her bipolar is a bitch excuse the language but its seriously horrid be there for hugs hold her when shes panicking and help her breathe slower while u hold her remind her that its ok to stay in bed or "check out" when overwhelmed shes blessed to have u,0
always knew that anxiety and depression frequently hang out together,1
taylor beebe im sorry i suffer as well i guess im in between manic and depression been diagnosed bi polor im so sorryhve took many of their drugs and im on nothing at this time my insides are shaking when im not sleeping as ive had to do without meds for 17 days im tired im so sorry,0
i would just say to you it is very early days and it is normal to be looking at the service sheet etc you are coming to terms with your very sad loss and you are probably in so much shock you think it is a nightmare you will wake up from you dont want it to be real if you are struggling then contact a bereavement association or councillor its never weak to ask for help it is our strength that permits us to admit we are struggling even medication can help you through but remember it is very early days a week is no time at all,0
get upset and frustrated with todays society suffer with major depression suicide is never off my mind but in this day and age there is no compassion conversation feelings or interaction its all about i want want want want selfish people is all i can say sad but true sometimes a hug is nice!!,0
yes there are depression causes stress stress causes headaches i do body scan meditation and that helps me relax,1
i take lamactil for my epilepsy bibi also suffer from manic depression/anxiety/ptsd and it works wonderfully with my other meds anx it has kept me seizure free for almost a year now,1
i just went through this my mania was so high it was causing anxiety attacks luckily new dr recognized this put me on seroquel its been a godsend,1
if your scared and you think its time to go then yes its time to go!,0
i actually love being manic i get lots done i have energy im more open to human interaction i get along with people better its so great for me but i know that eventually im going to crash so hard thats what i hate about it; the constant dread of "when is that next swing going to hit?" the only time i dont like mania is when im in a mixed episode; angry so full of *negative* energy and too depressed to release it safely but its different for everyone i can see why some people would dislike it,0
get the brain shocks when in detox? me too horrible drug does help with depression but leaves you feeling numb thats a prison i never want to return too,0
living with mental illness please check out my blog theres much insight on my struggles and ways to cope (=,0
it`s hard when we hide our symptoms makes it harder for even the best support systems to know they need to intervine (i still do it though) surviving the aftermath: take an honest self assesment accept your acheivements limitations & your ablities build from there don`t stress on what your sickness has caused you`re better now educate people on your symptomatic behaviors & some helpful resposes it can take weeks or months for me to `bounce back` completely keep you`re mind occupid set small goals celebrate every accomplishment (even the tinest baby step!) & be patient with yourself,0
all i can imagine 4 martinis would put me over the edge i used to drink heavily until diagnosed bipolar i used drinking to try to sleep when i started meds i stopped because my meds help me sleep i tried drinking on the 4th  i would rather not feel horrible so thankful not dependant on it anymore,1
thank you you lovely people! im at a stage of being scared to say any more to anyone especially family and friends i feel very alone still fed up to be honest its making me angry sitting here in this shell of what i used to call home thats life its shit ill just have to deal with it!!,0
dishes laundry mop do whatever u can to alieve any outside stressors so that she can deal with the spiral head on,0
you are definitely bipolar try lithium its the one med for bipolar that wont cause tardive dyskinesia maybe klonopin! at least your reaching out! you absolutely need a therapist especially if you feel you want to hurt others lexapro targets major anxiety which seems to be most of what makes up bipolar it helped my 2 family members they still struggle but they arent as angered one of my family members said it helped them from feeling like they wanted to killmedical marijuana needs to be not just for chronic pain but definitely passed for bipolar because of the dystonia type side affects the anti psychotic medicine for bipolar can cause im praying you get control because its just as hard on the family and youll want your children to grow up healthy normal life can be hard enoughblessings/praying,0
i am attacked by bipolarity ptsd and others psychology does not believe in demons possession but after 18 years of therapy and medication i finally tried exorcism i feel the best i ever have! i am still on three medications but i am down from six! some mental illness is a chemical imbalance and others are clinical as you know i believe now that clinical mental illness is really demon possession and should be treated as such look at the man yelling while walking down the street he is not just ramblings there is a subject and a verb someone did something or didnt (god maby)and he relives this over and over he cant get past it mary the government husband etc etc these people are hurting and you dont just tell hurting people to "get over it" they are believing lies and need to hear the truth! maby there should be some kind of combination treatment combining faith reason and a little medication until maximum improvement is achieved i was on lithium for 15 years and all it did was make me numb to life! i could feel anger love fear or joy! is that healing? no,0
this makes perfect sense to me the things that should be okay things ive experienced a hundred times without harm still create utter panic,0
anxiety try breathing exercises,1
michelle armstrong i was only able to go to one day of the convention last year and struggled the whole time ive spent hours with my therapist trying to prepare for the convention this year im just trying to get as many tools in my toolbox as possible so that i can make it to all three days this year,0
try mindfulness there are plenty of resources on the net and i think there are even apps you can download that can help to focus your thoughts and attention onto things that are more helpful id also speak to your dr keep a mood journal that you can take to your appointment as it can help with diagnosis and is there so you dont have to stress about remembering everything,1
talk to your dr about this there are other pills than lamictal finding the right combo of pills can be horrible but youll get there!,1
yes sometimes the anxiety can be too much for me! i have found some good edibles that gives me the calm that i need! i just can get them all the time!,1
effexor the last trimester and for 2 years nursing325 mg he is fine and 13 nowhe didnt have any adhd or any other disorder the hormones really make depression and anxiety hard with my first i went free of medication but for my second baby i chose medication i was able to have some control over my depression and be more calm and present for my baby,1
im just very self conscious and very insecure about how i look im a female u know  we have those issues  ive struggled with low self esteem since i was around thirteen maybe even before that  im now 29 society and the media have me feeling so very bad about myself and i honestly have so much self hate i just have a very bad self image and im always comparing myself to the pretty good looking cute girls that i wish i could be but i will never be cuz im just trash,0
actually thats not true i was a single mother with my oldest son for a while  i was so happy i cant ever remember being more happy now i have two sons n am with my youngest sons father he loves my oldest like his own takes care of both the boys and me hes amazing  but im miserable relationships can take a toll on bipolar people sometimes its better not to be with someone kids or not,0
i was on it for 15 years got really run down during the summer and ended up with toxicity it was good until then im a bit too nervous to go back on it now,0
i agree i write letters and i keep a diary due to some days i cant remember what i was upset and angry for bless you sweetie xx,0
i cant even read it because of the red background the contrast will trigger an anxiety attack if i force myself to read it,0
mania or hypomania is what gives you the diagnosis for me it can be euphoria the world is a wonderful place and everybody is my friend it can also be rage irritability your behaviour can be reckless financially sexually even driving the car you may believe you are the fountain of all knowledge you can accomplish anything you are unstoppable and that can include talking sleep is a good indication of mania you can get by with very little sometimes none,0
i find the propananolol helps with the heart palps i have with my anxiety,1

i am on sertraline 200mg for deoressionbut feel it isnt working i just feel constantly down and scared its effecting my marraige can anyome suggest anything? i cant pin point what makes me down but its so hard to just "snap out of it",0
i am bipolar also with panic anxiety depressive disorder ive been in severe pain for many years i finally was diagnosed having fibromyalgia deep pain in upper and lower back shoulders and neck i have all 18 tender points maybe you can talk with ur dr about it! good luck to you,1
i think it depends on where your depression is coming from if your brain isnt able to produce certain hormones/chemicals on its own a nice walk in the woods wont help medication is the only way to replace those things then think of it like diabetes - if your body wont produce insulin on its own itll need help with that if its coming from stress a trauma or something similar natural ways like relexation techniques talking therapies etc might help depending on how open your mind is to those things,1
i have read this 11 times and and i (i am very sorry if i offend you in any way )see you have just typed everything about me i am looking at my life in this text as if i was a mirror i am feeling a bit overwhelmed again i am sorry if i offend you i find this hard to explain to anyone it comes out of my mouth the wrong way and then i feel stupid and go lock myself away or i explode and shout and scream for the silliest reason the only thing is i havent hurt my self but if i do have pain i let it get really bad as i feel comfort in it i but at times i feel i am just waiting to die i am only 52 i dont know where to turn or what to do i am so confused i hope you can find the help you need and may your god bless you and your family with love health wealth and happiness,0
1) stop sign realize that is your anxiety that is giving you the hit the fan feeling and out of body type thing is called disassociative (sp) disorder both are to be expected as well as nausea and appetite changes possibly dizzy and lightheaded 2) find another doctor fast if you have to go to a clinic like red rock or north care even dhs should have some resources for you to help speed things up 3) smoke some pot im sure im gonna come under fire for this but it does help with the agitation and anxiety not so much the depression but it doesnt sound like you have that at the moment please take care if you need to get to a hospital for a couple days please dont wait i hope this helps you and others have great ideas as well we are all here for you,1
sertraline saved my life seriously ive been taking it off and on for years and its the only medication that works well for both my anxiety and depression note: some docs wont tell you this but make sure to eat with it good luck!,1
jess n kailey  i agree with you jess how can others understand a depression that is caused by a chemical imbalance if they havent experienced it themselves? they dont which only adds to the stigma and it doesnt help either - in addition to being depressed you should also feel guilty about it? putting oneself out there one will get all kind of responses - try to rule out the ones that only brings you down and look for those who show actual understanding,1
i no how you feel i carnt even try to have a bath cuz i panic never mind go out anywhere,0
know the feeling just horrible,0
suicide is never ok its unfortunate that our minds get so desperate to relieve ourself from what ever it is where going threw that we are tricked into thinking this is the answer perhaps its your answer but that doesnt make it ok theres nothing ok with a life being taken even if its your own your taking,0
meds dbt family support therapy might take a while to find the right meds  as time changes you might be able to take less and during rough times more i have bipolar 1 anxiety depression ptsd and chronic illness adhd i take 5 different ones and im still changing the doses  but im doing good took a while hang in there good luck,1
i think its definitely worth a try with medication unfortunately its a bit of trial and error until you find the right one for you and the correct dose as they can vary but i was told today by a doctor for somebody else that that medication can help with anxiety so i guess your gp would have taken your situation into account when prescribing them acute anxiety can start at a very young age and can then lead to other things if not addressed hopefully you are making great strides in trying to get help to overcome this awful condition it can be terrible at times however taking medication isnt always easy for some people so completely understand the things you ve said really well done for seeking help best wishes x,1
i live in upstate new york and i know that we have prescription programs set up counties vary in how they do it to assist with paying for prescriptions i would ask your pharmacy about it try and avoid the alcohol too,0
try speaking to somebody as well then during it a friend or somebody you live with distracting yourself might work or go to your doctor as they should be able to get you in contact with a physiatrist to help you get over the fear is it something youve had since a child or is it from a trauma like mine?,1
hell my meds change constantly if you do not understand why or how much of a medication you can call your provider and speak with their nurse or talk to your pharmacist my pharmacy gives me an information printout on each med i take every time it is filled or refilled i have bipolar severe mixed you are not alone i get paranoia and tend to be catastrophic and have many trust issues you must become your own advocate accept help when you can ask if you wonder take care of yourself is #1 i have boys i raised when diagnosed it was difficult but more freeing as children are more forgiving they do not need long or inappropriate information continued my love for them explained when "mommy" was not feeling well now they are young men who understand my disease and freely love me do not overburden your children with language they would not understand please take care and love yourself and love and respect your children,0
i thought guys would enjoy it but not all guys have a high sex drive mine has increased even more since ive been happier and less stressed ive always have a high drive since i was really young but my past relationship was terrible so i never wanted it im obsessed with porn too but have been staying away so it doesnt affect my sex life,0
i dont have bipolar but i have severe depression n anxiety so im just gonna give u advice 4 what works with me first dont ask 2 many questions n dont go oh thats so sad n dont tell him that hes gonna got over it also hugs r the best hug him but dont get offended when he doesnt return the hug coz sometimes i get annoyed when people hug me coz they think it will fix everything but sometimes it doesnt n also just listen 2 him talk my closest friends r the 1s who will actually sit their asses down n listen 2 me complain cry n shit idk if it will help him but it helps me :),1
you need to push to see a psychiatrist or even just call simaritains and talk i overdosed on baclofen a few years ago and as they relax the muscles my heart rate practically stopped worse than that my 17 yr old son came home to find me sitting in the hall terrified i was seeing writing appearing on the wall all negative things i could hear music and shouting no one else couldnt by luck my son had a support worker he called who manged to talk me into going to hospital and convince me what i was perceiving to be real wasnt happening i was told at hospital overdose triggered a psychotic episode with severe paranoia and had to be prescribed medication for the normal use of scitzophrenia for two weeks till the hallucinations stopped it was the most terrifying experience iv ever had id never be as silly again i shudder to think what i could have done to myself or others if my son had not returned home and knew something was way wrong with me x,0
no one in my family has bipolar or should i say no one has ever said they were bipolar  i have a son who is 5 and a daughter on the way  i wasnt diagnosed with bipolar until my son was 3 years old  knowing what i know now and becoming educated on the disease i wasnt scared to have another !!,0
nothing is in control stresses me more i dont believe in a higher power and i am learning that i cant control everything but the thought of having no control is too terrifying,0
i take lamictal and when they took me off tegretol they doubled the lamictal dose and tolld it would hold me- did not happen- had a horrible long mania so they ended up putting me back on tegretol and keeping the lamictal as well- for me lamictal just was not enough if you are having mania then you need more of a mood stabilizer plus a new doctor if she/he will not listen to you no doc should be threatened when we do research into our condition- we are the ones living with it not them i have been diagnosed bipolar 1 for 40 years or so,1
sounds like she needs to be hospitalised  dont worry about her being mad its difficult being a parent but you trying to get her help praying for all of you,1
yes difficult to set a routine that is suppose to be healthy for stabilization and recovery i hate the uncontrollable crying!,0
i am almost 45 been through several marriages(not gonna say how many) most of which i was not medicated i have a 24 year old diagnosed with bipolar and a 20 year old undiagnosed(but i know the signs) i wasnt diagnosed until after i had my boys i hate that i passed it on to my babies but i also wouldnt take a million dollars for them! i have been pretty stable for several years now but im not going to lie its been a long hard road! i hate my boys had to live through some of my worst times but they love me and understand now that they are older but i still feel guilty for putting them through it! this is just my story everyone is different,0
she told him she was on birth control and was messaging me telling me he already filed for divorce she was taunting me and making it a point to let me know that they was going to spend the rest of their lives together she even sent me a picture of rings they were looking at i myself suffer from depression anxiety ptsd so all this is really taking a toll on me thank you guys for being supportive and understanding as well,0
worry beads are beads you string together my sister put some together for me that she picked out at the craft store they were all of various shapes but harmonious in color i could hold them in my hand and run my fingers over and over them it really helped! i have a couple now i use flexible string that will not break easily i then choose beads that the color catches my eye and the touch feels right in my hand making a bracelet is easy to start with when you think it is long enough tie it off and seal it with clear nail polish let me know if you try this or have any questions,0
yes totally half of my own family just doesnt understand how hard it is 2 deal with this crap on a daily basis they just gave up on me and im so tired of being tired but especially when u already feel scared and alone all the time then your own family gives up on u,0
im so sorry for your loss but happy youre speaking out to help more of us im asking for help my insurance dropped me and now i am having trouble getting my anti depressants ive been off them a week and i have gone back to where i used to be strugglingi want to sell my possessions and end the pain ive not hurt myself but ive thought of at least cutting so i draw on myself,0
sounds like a very complex set of symptoms the thing that truly helped me was dbt therapy and mindfulness it was very difficult for me to begin practicing consistently but i kept at it its taken me 4 years of learning that essential oils calm my anxiety a mood stabilizer and sleep meds make sure im getting enough sleep staying hydrated do my dbt worksheets and have become more patient with myself its not easy to change my reactions and volatile aggression but it can be done! its a lifestyle change like any other dbt works if you work it also would recommend bpd central forums and also nami family to family program for your adult family members wish you all the best!,1
am i the only one who is bipolar has depression and anxiety but takes no medicines? and is surviving on my own? alone?,1
i have rapid cycling bipolar 1 with anxiety im on 400 mg oxcarbamazapine as my mood stabilizer and then seroquel 300 mg is my antipsychotic and then propranolol 80 mg is my anxiety med and migraine prevention med,1
i set an alarm on my phone works wonders,1
same boatmy mother was unattached with me since birthshes very religious so wherever i have pointed out my mental issues (depression and anxiety) she says its all because i abandoned the churchand if i would just come back to "the lord" i would be completely healedmost of the time we end up in a severe argument and she hangs up on meso ive stopped trying to make her understandshes set in her ways and shes 85,0
but there is a difference between you thinking about your family and making the decision to hold on and somebody else throwing guilt at you and calling you selfish for needing your pain to end trying to guilt people into not suffering from a mental illness is just as ludicrous as trying to guilt a cancer patient for being sick,0
have felt the samescared of my own shadowis there anyone who could stay with you until youve found your feet again?,0
this is something i find myself repeating with people who are newly diagnosed or not understanding of the illness you can still live your dream you will still have your passion and joy it dosent go away but it can make things harder learn your body track your moods pay attention to yourself and youll find what works and what dosent for you even if you can only manage to work on something 10 minutes a day thats 10 minutes of work more than the day before i had always wanted to write fiction i was never encouraged or supported and when i broke under life pressure and my mental illness i felt it time to kill the dream then i met my wonderful partner who found my notes and half written stories and told me to keep going it was slow and i wont lie hard some days i finished my first novella after almost 3 years of labor and am now working on the sequel im honestly not the best writer things are sometimes hard for me to convey (i had 3 amazing friends beta reading to help) i may never make a full living off my works but that was never the point i have stories in my head screaming for life and i have a duty to provide it,0
im so sorry your having to go thru this you seem very mature for your age and have researched and planned it well we are supposed to be able to rely on family but some cases it just isnt thstvway and you must look out for yourself and your own pyhsical and mental well being and dont feel guilty for that! you deserve to be happy! and if you have a plan then go for it all the laws and stuff you billeted you are very right my son ran away at 17 and it was that way w the law however he ran away bc he was using drugs and i was on a mission to keep him clean there are so many good people in this world i hope you find ones along your journey to help you! good luck and lots of prayers! ❤️,0
thats so true but most people we are not sick shame on them,0
eh dont worry about it clearly a good portion of people here (at least the admins) thinks there is a one size fits all solution (pharmaceuticals) to mental health problems when of course that is a silly ridiculous notion that needs to be squashed out,0
shaming someone is never useful shes trying to dig herself out of shame unless you are without flaws i would suggest some kindness,0
i take welbutrine to help with the irritation trazadone helps with insomnia,1
at 30mg i had a lot of irritability and agitation my daughter didnt even want to talk to me my doctor put me on 60 mg and most of it went away,0
once youre on it do not screw around with lapses between refills you will go through withdrawl and its terrifying the short-term memory issues are also very real,0
you need to grin and bare my dear if you want to feel better sweating isnt the least of your worries,0
benzos actually didnt seem to help my anxiety much and i was put on a regular and increasing dosage which i questioned but doctor insisted it was fine gave me memory loss and made learning impossible didnt connect the dots until after semester ended and it was too late i think i would have been alright had i only used it if i felt the point of no return for a panic attack coming i will have to keep that geodon in mind if i need to readdress things my current doctor only has me on adhd meds now i know bipolar isnt out of the question as well,1
the need to know that they wont exasserbate your condition or harm you if the job caused you harm theyd be liable if your doctor doesnt sign it because theyre worried then you shouldnt be working,1
creativity comes in lots of forms its not just about drawing or playing piano (anxiety depression and add mean i am a compassionate and creative problem solver),1
i have the same problem only i hate family gatherings i always feel they are watching me to see if i say the wrong thing if i dont say anything they wonder if i am mad or sick i have a lot physically wrong with me then you add bi polar i also have chronic depression and anxiety i worry about everything i work myself up over things that turn out okay i constantly am consumed by death planning in my head my funeral and everything i guess i am wanting to make sure they get it right i dont want to die i would not take my life for my religious convictions i just think about it maybe because of my health things i loved to do i cant i still can read and use my computer for two hours circulation in my legs i am 64 and have been sidelined since i was 49another thing is all i do is talk to my sisters about what doctor i went to and what they found they dont want to think of those things they dont want to loose me god bless you dear one day at a time and no matter what you are wonderful,0
its been a year since the last pill i took now i face another form of mental illness why god why? i know why i just wanna say "why" if anyone offers me to change who i am to get a new different life with a new identity as a human being i pass no thank you i know its hard to live like this especially when those people who dont understand what youre going through keep bullying you but i wont exchange me my life my struggle with anything else no matter how bad it is how hard it is im here and im still alive and thats enough i dont think anyone else can be as strong as i am today so ill live ill do whatever it takes to stay alive,0
im part of the 60% but over a year sober now! the real struggle for me tends to be finding ways other than drinking to cope with mental illness ,0
anxiety doesnt make you do anything you choose to react to it thusly it is you who made these choices i know because i have experienced all of this and more and changed it all too by choosing to be honest and realize i am in control at all times i am not a victim!,1
i cope with medication clonezapam i have bi-polar2 ocd generalized anxiety to be honest im not sure how i could/would be able to cope i have been on meds since 2009,1
i am bipolar 2 i have more lows than highs and my highs are mostly irritability with a lot of energy i believe bipolar 1 is more highs than lows and their highs are extreme,1
yes its herbal i had taken it in texas from heb its a tonic im sure they will have it listed it did work for a while they also have other tonics like happy mood etc its like taking st johns wort for depression you can look up and try different types of herbs for anxiety cbd oil is real good mood lifter,1
i was agoraphobic for 5 years could go anywhere in a car i would have to pull over and get out of the car due to anxiety attacks i too have gads  bipolar depression and suffer from ptsd i currently on prozac trazadone and bupropion its a long story but i had to get to a point  after suffering for 40 years that i wasnt going to live my life like that anymore no medicine helped me with my anxiety attacks i only became addicted to them even tho they didnt work 13 yrs ago  i drove from long beach here to moreno valley by myself i hadnt driven in over 10 years,1
to help counter this problem my dr prescribed memory medication that is often used for mild alheimers (cant spell that) and dementia his reasoning is that some of my other meds like mood stabilizer and anxiety meds may also be part of the memory problem,1
you are not alone this is a journey of lifes ups and downs you may not hear or even see the words with the responses youll receive today and days after i dont know you im not sure of your struggles i wont say "i know how you feel" because youre special i will say "ive been where you are right now" i thank god everyday for life we survivors all are embrace who you are go for a walk and smell some flowers  the fact that youve written about your night means youre way stronger and wiser than you give yourself credit for i dont know you but i love you we are sisters or sister/brother life would be terrible if you forced an event that isnt natural we are meant to follow our purpose sometimes you dont know what that purpose is until one day it just clicks you are love ❤️ you are lovable you are loving hoffman process/institute pls look it up,0
heather marie awan a nice read crazy tho i go to bed late and wake up early in a panic,0
i agree with you i also hate to see my daughter struggle with it i hate the pain it causes me to have prayers to you and your child,1
the shepard boys no one here will ever see it either was a film in the toronto film festival absolute pos film 3/4s of the audience got up and walked out i stayed with the last 1/4 just to see if it could get any worse and it didnt disappoint there i mean what a pos and this is coming from a guy that once a month has "bad movie" day and watch just horrible movies all day long  shepard boys what a pos,0
my dad ended his life 40yrs ago up until about 10yrs ago i blamed myself it was shameful then so didnt talk about it had to tell people that he just died my depression started then finally got help for myself and the psychologist told me that it wasnt my fault and then my mum told me that my dad had mental issues i sometimes still feel guilt but that is because i suffer deep depression i wonder if i could have stopped him by telling him that i loved him in the end it is their decision and you just have to accept that they had a problem that they couldnt overcome ,0
trick with remeron is to keep to a higher dosage 45-60 unless theyre using it for sleep then it needs to be 75-30 mg also found effexor worked great for depression and anxiety added with 75mg remeron nightly that totals my depression and anxiety; still have traumatic anxiety but thats getting treated separately,1
yeah it boils down to approach theres is encouragment and theres guilt tripping support not judgement being encouraged to think of your loved ones is not the same as being accused of being selfish for supposedly not considering them some people mean well others are just assholes,0
ill have to set an alarm then lol im scared to start it i havent been on medicine since i was 15 im 24 now so its been quite some time ,0
omg u hit the nail on the head and ive noticed about three days before full moon my anxiety over whelming and im depression bad x,0
well my doctor prescribed a almost three years ago the two previous years i had refused to be put on any so called moodstabilizer lithium lamotrigin/lamictal but fell into one of my worst periods of depression abilify (i was very hesitant!) an anti-psychotic drug wow!! after a few weeks i felt life again! after yet a while my energy shot through the roof i felt very content happytoo happy jitters - yes! after 3 months or so i was practically unable to be still my body and my mind couldnt take it anymore i lost weight very fast (which goes to show how very individual use of bp-drugs can manifest itself) well well that was that can still miss the good months on a dont dare to try it again but i know of comrades for whom a turned out great it surely can take a long time before one finds the best bp-drugs by the way im bp ii and was diagnozed as an "oldie" just 5 years ago - 55 now (excuse my somewhat clumsy english am swedish),0
i think im in 2 different discussions haha sorry but my anxiety is so bad i cant work drive associate with public etc my dr said i have to rely on clonazepam to get by for the rest of my life ive tried everything non-narcotic does not work for me our bodies are different,1
i use mindfulness it has been a godsend there are plenty of resources on the internet explaining what it is and what to do and there are even apps for your phone a simple eg is colouring it helps you focus on one thing so you change your mindset like i said its a simple example its something you need to practice everyday so you are ready when your anxiety starts to take hold take care,1
your right i should be feeling better but one of my children died in 2013 at the age of only 44 years old andrew ( andy) he liked to be called andy had 3 wonderful children 2 boys a girl he was the first one to make me a grandmother with a boy i was getting really better about my life my mental health issues but when andy died by killing himself how does a mum cope with that my youngest son was very fretting me they had a family meeting said that if i came to andys funeral that the family would remove me i wasnt aloud to even send flowers a card even to dill with problems ive always taken things out on myself but i got put in the linden centre chelmsford just because what i did in the past my children had a horrible up bringing which was my fault in out of care andy myself fell out 15 years before he died i will never ever forgive myself for what happened to him the phone call to let me know at 7am couldnt stop crying for that i got put on section 3 family friends need to understand about mental health ive tried to call write to my family but nothing comes back to me so ive just got to live the rest of my life without my 3 children12 grandchildren 4 great grandchildren i hope all of my family have good lifes be happy thats all i need them to know i miss them all im very proud of them all i love ❤ them so much,0
ive been there done that he put me on the wrong dosage and i was so dizzy and lightheaded etc i couldnt sleep or stay up so i shaked back and forth in bed till it wore off felt like i was going to die so i never toke it again dont get me started on other sexual side effects it caused good times :p ,0
some people fear the mentally ill rather than help them even those who say they love someone who is mentally ill often reacts with anger and resentment instead of understanding mental health education needs to be more prevalent it angers me to see those who are ill taken advantaged of,0
you are not alone being diagnosed is the first step dont be afraid to share your true feelings put you first take care of you there is a huge support system out there good luck ,0
hes saying bullshit not everyone has depression he doesnt understand anything i have depression and anxiety since basically i could talk and i know how hard it is to fake a happy act i get rages from my intermittent explosive disorder and cutting is the only thing that calms me down also i cut from guilt costing money and feeling such a burden ive been trying to stop but its not working its just who i am if your friends wont accept that im here for you drown yourself in fav music you arent worthless to me stay alive for me i dont want you to die ive been suicidal since 8 yrs old that was my first attempt and last year i basically died my body wasnt functioning and i was walking around out of my body i was terrified pls stay here for me <3,0
yes my history is very similar to yours i was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety for 26 years then new symptoms appeared and i became very angry and destructive at times other times i was manic high on life an unstoppable force i gained a lot of weight while depressed then i spiraled out of control with insomnia unfocused suicide attempt lost over a 100# and did not recognize myself i was hospitalized and diagnosed with bipolar severe i still battle with suicide ideation often i think no one wants or loves me i spend time alone with my own thoughts praying and writing i do know if i committed suicide my children would definitely be hurt by my loss they keep me going i do not want to bring any destructive forces into their livesmy love is unconditional as for everyone else who offers nothing but judgement and negativity block all they tell you you are sick and people like your mom are only making your situation worse and more stressful you are worth it loved and needed always,0
yep i struggle with this every day i try,0
hey chad im in recovery myself im aware theres different addictions i know about the struggles of faceing our demons that kept me using i fight em errr day i have a good relationship wit my higher power ill support anyone in recovery n some in active addiction i talk wit em n try to encourage them to get help,0
ive been in this predicament and its taken a while but hubby has come around to seeing the bigger picture it took for me to see it too i have a few lazy days then balance it out by going batshit crazy when i have the energy to go!! haha it really takes understanding on both sides for each other to get anywhere the fact hes not holding it in means hes fighting for the relationship how u go about it from here on in knowing this affects that let him see ur best and worst hun!!! (bipolar and anxiety) ,0
my mum does the same and im waiting for that phone call that tells me shes gone please seek out a professional you can trust; be honest & open about all this the comfort you get now isnt worth the risk you matter youre stronger than you believe at the mo you are strong! your prescribed meds are enough so please think twice about playing russian roulette with otc meds however you feel there must be somewhere to turn for support wishing you all the best ill be thinking of you (( <3 )),0
what a love of god to show and share shame on your grudge may forgiveness and mercy be blessed to you,0
depression + anxiety = i dont care and everyone hates me sigh my life,1
i have anxiety i use acrylic metal will damage your teeth hun,1
i have been on effexor for about 10 years and its mellowed out my depression and anxiety but like today i dont feel it mellowing anything out but i also know one pill isnt going to cure depression,1
how long have you been on it? is it possible that you need a medication adjustment? i found i was worse on the higher doses sertraline than the lower ones at 50 i was ok but anxiety wasnt controlled was upped to 100 and had multiple panic attacks a day generally unwell hang in there medication can be frustrating ive been messing with mine for a year and finally have an apt with a new dr for evaluation,1
hi i have the same thing and the same thoughts i broke down and tried to kill myself with my dads gun before getting help i was admitted to impatient ward and was there for 4 days after getting out i did a out patient for 4 weeks it changed my life ive never been so happy if you know you need help dont wait just go your gut is always right go and get help,0
i have bi-polar disorder ptsdocdand adhdand i think the older i get im leaning toward some paranoia symptoms i hope not but i pray for everyone who sees this post !!!!!!!!!we all have to stick 2gether and help each other !!!,1
or telling me to just slow down my breathing and breath normal and dont shake  dahhhhh i cant just make it stop just like that and it actually hurts so bad in my chest that with my first one i thought it was a heart attack  so did the er,0
i am on lithium 800mg a day and 40mg fluoxetine for my anxiety it goes by the level in your blood not how many mg 06 / 08 is what my dr said the level should be with lithium ask your dr what your levels are and what they should be you seem to be on a lot hope this helps x,1
i gave up many times too but even so i never truly stopped caring i have social phobia and general anxiety disorder among a few other problems but they arent nearly as bad as the social phobia i cant get help from the right people because i cant express myself the way i want to; like i cant tell somone what the problem is i cant even get to the point of talking to someonebut i had an idea that changed my outlook (even though its still eating away at me it will get better) i decided that im going to start recording myself most of the time and start a youtube channel it will give me a way to push through the anxiety on my own terms and at my own pace it does give me hope and even if it fails it will still have helped a lot but one of the biggest issues is that i keep getting stuck on starting anything i always feel the need to be pushed in a direction so i can know what im supposed to be doing i hold myself back by not just going for it so this is me going for it lol i appologize to all the people that keep having to read my long postsand thats not a joke i really dont know if its my anxiety or not but i feel like im the only one who talks this much on facebook maybe even the whole internet lol (okay maybe it was partially a joke) ill shut up now,0
oh my im going through the same exact thing! im worried i wont be able to hold down this job long enoughwhat happens when i go through something else and i cant get my disability back? im also a good fighter but sometimes i just want to stay home and think all day about everything i mean everything! then i get paranoid and depressed im a wreck but i need the money,0
my boyfriend and i both struggle with mental illness so when one is down and struggling the other who knows all too well how hard it can be and is the support system i have cptsd and he is agoraphobic with severe anxiety so theyre both very different but we know we can always get through to the other side together,0
this is something i post alot about because it helps me alot is medical marijuana if you do the right research and really look into it it could really help you like most medicine you do need to be careful when first trying it as it is not for everyone i have an overwhelming amount of loss and trauma in my life and its the only thing i use because i have problems with ingesting things to hurt myselfso if you havent already it might be something to look into ,1
i understand that depression is a horrible illness that poisons the mind its not mind over matter because the mind is the matter but with that being said what keeps me chugging along through my depression is knowing that its my mind that is broken the facts are much different ppl do love me i do have a good family i do have good friends i do have a good job i do have the things i need even though at times it doesnt feel like iti know that its my poisoned mind that makes me feel so worthless i assume that doesnt help you with your struggles but it helps me i try and push out the negative and focus on whats good i believe that you see what tou loom for even though depression makes that soooo much more difficult and even impossible at times just know you are loved maybe not the way you need to be loved but you are loved and with depression you can be loved the way you need to be but still not see it or feel itat least thats whats true with me,0
yes we should fight for them here in america in my town our hospital 20yrs ago a doctor told me that here we tend to sweep mental illness under the rug i recently to a razor down my arm and went deep and long ways  it was bad  they stapled it back together they were holding me to send off to a mental unit some where  the nurse told me we dont treat phyic patients here! and if you try and escape we will lock you up in a room well that set me off and i left without notice and was listed as a missing person i had hit bottom once gain  i survived  im 59yrs old my illnesses started in my early 20s  anxiety  depression and now bi polar disorder,1
how is this disturbing explain ,0
i think thats what is unclear and giving me anxiety what am i working and living for? im just starting to build my life after years of spiraling down neglecting myself just started working again after taking a couple years off to get healthy dealing with anxiety and depression coming up as i take on more responsibility especially today i guess i need to do what we all need to do sometimes take some deep breaths be kind and patient with myself and trust in the process of transition i dont know exactly what i want to do with my life but ill find out while i do what i have to do,1
thats basically how mine went but i had physical disabilitys too im not saying someone should make something up but if you are being treated forhigh blood pressure diabetes chronic pain etc bring documents/doctors records for that too,0
there is no shame in taking meds im on sertraline aka zoloft too just started it 2 weeks ago from being on effexor xr for years it seems to be working but it affects peeps differently your only a failure when u fail to try!,1
i know how you feel i also have a daughter that suffers bpd and it so painful to see her struggle ~s~,0
just came off of a 6 week episode of mania or hypomania whatever it is! i love it for all the same reasons we all do but know i cannot keep up with it all forever but sure wish i could! no fear of the world at all then i start to get irritated by everything under the sun & then the ugly depression comes i have many more episodes of depression than mania and would give anything for it to be reversed,0
said these words to my michelle sullivan-gregory just 7 days ago amidst a post bipolar rage panic attack and internal guilt world tour,0
ethan do you have a close friend a relative or a counselor that you can turn to in times of trouble? you should likely have a personal safety plan prepared (meaning you have someone to go be with when you feel especially depressed vulnerable or suicidal) you definitely need to be seeing a doctor for your bipolar disorder if you arent already its an illness that needs to be medically treated you definitely cant change that by yourself its like thinking that if you had cancer or diabetes you could just change it by wanting to or thinking hard enough about it thats not how it works you probably know that bipolar disorder is usually caused by chemical imbalances in the brain you need medications to help with getting your brain chemistry back on a healthy midline for you your depression is probably causing you to have pervasive thoughts and thought loops (just in case you dont know what that is as many people wouldntthats when you get the same awful negative thoughts and memories playing over and over in your mind you try to get away from them but they often are intrusive and disturbing) depression is bad about causing those you sound like you might also have a bit of ptsd from being bullied all of those things can be treated well and effectively you need to see a doctor if you are really thinking of running away or doing anything damaging to yourself please seek out help at a hospital there are people who can help you and who will care for you and ethan i know this may be hard for you to believe right now but you never deserved to be bullied you didnt ask for it the bullies were the ones who were 100% in the wrongand not you please do not take to heart anything they mayve said about you bullies deliberately try to find something to hurt their victims with quite often they seem to know exactly where our vulnerabilities and insecurities lie and attack us there heres the thingtheyre in the wrong and im sure the things they said about you were cruel awful and negative i dont know you personally but i do know that no oneand i mean thisno one deserves to be treated like that please dont let them keep bullying you even now in your mind whenever those thoughts and memories come back into your mind try to confront them try to explain to yourself why those things were incorrect or why those people were wrong about you rebuild your inner strength by focusing on all the good that im sure exists in you and all the good youve done in your life those bullies didnt know the real youthe one deep inside only you and those closest to you really know you so dont let these bullies and their stupid hatefulness steal another moment of your life from you please get yourself some help for your bipolar and depression those can be treated and you might find all those negative thoughts and memories eventually fade with treatment you have only my very best wishes for a better future,0
thank you i didnt want anyone to diagnose me i was just freaking out a bit last night because i went from super high to super low and im terrified of the doctor so i didnt want to go there and make a fool of myself if it was nothing my gp is trying to sway me away from seeing a psyche i dont know why maybe im that crazy and she knows ill be sectioned or something if i see one lol,0

hi i had 12 ect treatments 6 years ago for severe depression that was resistant to all other treatment and medication it was very beneficial for me although i now have huge chunks of my life that i cannot remember which is upsetting i would rather have that than try and fight the depression everyday if you have the support you will need i would say have the ect all the best,1
if someone has threatened you call police yes ive been in this situation,0

drowning means your body and especially your mind is overwhelmed and right now you cant cope with whats on your plate which is a lot your a mother a wife a cook a cleaner a student a worker a woman with multiple mental illnesses of which not all are getting the treatment they deserve so you can not cry for 3 hours straight and not want to work! time to get honest because your borderline is active and maybe your bipolar causing panic attacks its a spiral that you need help to regulate and prevent in the future good luck honey just be honest sweetheart,1
my friends adopted famille and family get thisif cannot the fire or dragon dont poke at the cave where she dwells or feed the fire or ashes ashes,0
this is a true story i asked my older son to go to group therapy with me and he refused i need lee had a switch turn on in me and i chewed him out called him names told him he didnt care he was selfish conceded and told him never to call me again i feel bad now because i deleted his phone number from my phone book i have no way of getting ahold of him and i need to apologize to him i didnt mean it i dont know what happened im triggered this one off i got upset because i want him to know me and understand me and he doesnt want to and i was hurt so basically i run my older son all not intentionally he bought me necklaces for christmas the things i told him i was throwing them in the garbage i was terrible i dont know what to do i made a big mistake and i dont know how to correct it,0
it also did awful things to me i wanted to kill myself i have never felt that way before i was hysterical all the time i was so sick and had severe panic attacks and nightmares,0
i live in the united states i wish i knew more about your area to help you im also suicidal at times but i know that my life is worth it and that theres people in my life that love me and they would really be saddened if i wasnt here anymore and thats what i have to keep telling myself dont be afraid to go to a mental hospital they will help you and get you the right treatment that you need and reinforce those good things that you have about yourself and hopefully change your thinking were you can feel good about yourself from the inside and dont need other people to validate that for you i will be thinking about you and putting you in my prayers feel free to text me anytime if you need to talk,0
i on the other hand enjoy sparking terror into the eyes of ignorant normies :d,0
i wish i had this help available when i was having issues at work instead they were all afraid of me and then one (who was a friend turned jerk) tried getting me fired with hr reports well i left for a better job and worked on my health she was caught a couple months later stealing on camera cherry topper we worked at a large corporate bank,1
this person is being 100% honest they obviously want help but dont know where to turn these pages are made to help us when we feel like we have no one else i hope you personally never struggle with self-harm because its addicting just like cigs alcohol drugs eating starving and everything else sometimes when youre completely down you dont think straight and need help i know if im extremely depressed i cant function at all,0
also i really think it is the name attached to it humans are afraid of illness and when they hear the word it can tend to make one feel uncomfortable or powersless and its human nature to fear what we dont understand,0
im shaking too and i feel different in several different ways but i also get anxiety and such during each of the monthly full moons and after working in a neurophysiology lab at a psychiatric hospital for 35 years it was a known fact among the doctors that emotions became restless and rage became more prevalent it does affect me everyone is different,1
i agree with jennifer tenhagen a therapist does not diagnose however the worst thing anyone who suffers from a mental illness or any form of illness have the tendency to look it all up that plays tricks with your mind the best way to bring it up is to see a psychiatrist and do all the tests when you finish them then they can give you the correct diagnosis you may have anxiety and not adhd thats why a doctor needs to diagnose you i hope you the best i was diagnosed in 2005,1
honey thats absolutely horrible i hope you find someone who deserves you real soon you are a good person even if some people dont want to see it,0
i used to set an alarm on my phone but not easy to follow that when im at work or take them same time every day my worst one for forgetting it last one at night i only know if ive missed one when i see it still in the pill box the next morning,0
i would suggest having some blood work done and make sure you arent deficient in any vitamins or minerals many times people with bipolar or depression are deficient in vitamin d and other things so you might want to add that to you diet or take a supplement i think ( and please dont think i have any science to back me up on this) that things vary from person to person but based on what i see with meds that some meds work for some people and others work for others i am going to guess that is the way it is with diets too what will work for you might not be what works for others i mean there are some definite things all bipolars should avoid like alcohol and non-prescribed drugs and maybe dont over indulge in caffeine i try to stay under two cups a day but some days i go over that because i love coffee so much other than that i try to eat food that makes me feel good some days it is stuff that actually makes me feel healthy some days it is stuff that makes me feel like i want to live it depends on what sort of day i am having fresh fruits and veges are good for everyone lean meats are good for everyone lots of water is good for everyone staying away from junk food and sweets is good for everyone a nice walk is good for everyone,0
yes i do and its terrifying know matter how i try to explain they see from clear glass mine is cloudy!,0
i doubt it it is only and always a flaw in chemistry when all the circumstances are so bad all the doors you knock are locked by thousand locks when you cant even trust the ground under your feet when everyone is acting like you are a burden when you cant have fun for very very long time when you dont feel all the good feeling for such long time there is nothing anchoring you to this world and reality you start to fade awayin the hard circumstance of life i guess being depressed is a normal reaction from our body and soul there is nothing and nobody filling you up with positivity you try your best to go on by your energies but how long it can last really? 2 year 5 year even but not 10 years! after that there is this undeniable feeling of hopelessness that is normal for a year you almost forget it burying in the deepest grounds unaware of that it starts to grow and grow and one day you notice all your world is dark when you look up you see that little feeling of hopelessness that you thought you were got rid of by burying it had grown so big that casts its shadow all over your life! there is no escape but with a help from outside and a person who is really cares and whats to help but i am sorry that everyone is so busy with their live or accusing you with different thingsyou must be so lucky to has someone that cares so deeply that will do anything for you to just see you smilei hope all of you will have all the help you need god bless you all with total mental and physical health,0
ive simply pushed my shopping trolley aside sat down in the middle of the isle pulled out my cell and spend time on facebook till im okcrazy yes but works for me every time peeps will stare and andand so what so take a pillow with you give it a bash and throw the meds in the trash btw i saw a doc on the telly where professional therapists are treating patients by giving them a low dose of extacy during a 4 hour session for 3 days (obviously illegal) but with a 70% success rate on anxiety and a few other mental illnesses/disorders emem?,1
i take gabapentin for anxiety it works well,1
if i understand correctly you are feeling suicidal because you are alone and you are struggling your disorder it is also important to remember that our disorders do not define us they dont define us because it is how we deal with them and how we move forward that does! a good support network is very important maybe going to see a psychologist or registered counsellor could help but if those just dont do it for you there are many forms of therapy including art and anything creative look into it its something that could be worth looking into,0
latelly ive been in this kind of state of mind im not emotionally strong and if something goes bad my anxiety starts killing me day by day and my toughts of wanting do disapear and not exist emerges its sad and horrible but i know it will pass today i had an anxiety attack and all i wanted was to isolate myself and disapear *sorry my english* big hug warriors ♡,0
theres no quick fix im afraid and medication is not going to resolve all your issues i would also suggest seeing another specialist to confirm that all your diagnoses are correct if you genuinely do have all i wouldnt imagine you would be able to function at all bipolar depression anxiety can all be helped with medication but therapy important especially with depression anxiety and eat i g disorder to identify underlying cause there are no specific meds to treat bpd therapy is most beneficial but bpd can cause associated depression anxiety as above that can result can be treated autism not sure about but dont think so second opinion is my advice though,1
i agree that you need to see a psychiatrist and try medications i suggest adding some vitamins and minerals as well i struggled with severe depression for years and feel like vitamin b 12 saved my life it can be found it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin levels checked and get injections some people like me dont absorb b12 correctly so injections are the only method that works for me i also recently started taking magnesium tablets which have greatly reduced my anxiety i hope things get better for you very soon ,1
im on it at the moment twice a day still have anxiety but it has calmed it down havent noticed any side effects,0
you need to relax/ stay away from stress / try a massage / exercise whatever helps you i like lavender oil u can deal with a fair bit / dont panic bout if a relapse is coming it prob isnt but if serious symptoms start then get help ps quetiapine v good for helping u relax sleep : short term use x,1
when you feel suicidal but still have doubts call your local mental health center or er of the nearest hospital they know what to do,0
wendy mcmaster i only copied what the person wrote i have many fetishes but wanting to be beaten to the point of death would definitely qualify as abuse to me and that is something i struggle with lol,0
fools dont want to meet reality they are afraid to face the truth pwe hypocrite,0
so just an update to those who want it :) i saw the doctor she was so unhelpful its not even funny said that i should have gone to my gp with the pain and other symptoms after getting upset with her she admitted that i could be experiencing toxicity but refused to give me any tests said that i must stop the lithium and if im not better by monday i must go to my gp and ask for tests i demanded to be put back on my old mood stabilizer until i have seen my neuro to get better help with my seizures she insisted upon giving me an anti depressant which i have been told numerous times that i cant have and told me i must come back in 3 weeks unless the anti depressant makes me manic then i must come back sooner i am grossly unhappy with the way things went down today but im living in hope waiting to see my neuro in hope that i can qualify for ect or the surgery for epilepsy thanks to everyone for their support,0
disturbing?? how about this opens a dialogue for those who want and need to talkplease educate your self or you will be offended by someone with diabetes next ignorance before investigation always gets me in troublehave a blessed day,0
go to your dr as soon as possible and let them know about it not trying to scare you but the rash can cause death,0
my sister is bipolar and has horrible anxiety like myself and she is taking gabapentin and klonopin and she is down a few doses of her klonopin i take gralise which is gaba extended release and it helps me some ,1
i also use to think i had schizophrenia because of the rage that was inside me it used to make me that angry that i would attack myself and self destruct as much as i could and the thoughts that ran through my mind were so sadistic and quite sickening but it was just part of my borderline and came with my rage fits im past that now i no longer feel suicidal when i have outbursts and no longer self destruct or self harm i can control my moods 10 times better than i used to all because i got the right help and the right treatment for my problem meds ever worked for me so i forced myself off of them im now med free for my problems but i still take mertazapine occasionally for sleep as i have bad insomnia i found the only mer that ever did help with my anxiety depression and mood stabilisation was mertazapine all the others i tried made things worse harder to deal with or turned me dumb seroquel for instance literally caused me to start stuttering and losing my mind i couldnt even reply to someone when they asked me my name or date of birth because i couldnt remember i started feeling dumb and embarrassed so j stopped taking it and writhing 3 weeks i was myself again no more stuttering or forgetfulness but all meds work for different people i just dont ever reconnect seroquel to people because of my effects its trial and error with everything whether it be pills therapy or finding the right person to diagnose you when one fails try and try again goodluck with finding the root of your problems so you can get the right help that you need :) i hope you have some understanding soon,1
all that anxiety you are holding inside of you is a result of you not talking to someone let it out (to a reputable therapist) cry dont hold it in its better than any medication trust me,1
im horrible with meds i dont take them or i take to many,1
youre with people with anxiety problems you could just start with "let sometimes your fear not decide your future",0

i have had the conversation with my daughter with increasing details as she has grown mommy has a brain that doesnt think or work like others i take medicine to help me but i still will sometimes be overwhelmed this is the cause for my frustration and why i feel the need to yell it is to right to yell at you and i am very sorry i love you more than anyone on this earth and i am trying my best to be a better mother to you that is why i keep trying and sometimes it doesnt work it isnt your fault and it isnt right but i love you so much that i am doing everything i can to get help people arent perfect and parents are people too do you have any questions or what to tell me how you feel? that is more or less how it goesand at least having the information and the facts could help her i grew up not knowing why with my mother so i am trying to give her something she can be certain about,0
dont be scared it seems scary at first but take one thing at a time you do need to go see the doctor though he will prescribe the right meds dnt get discouraged keep fighting,1
a constant my life is changing so rapidly and i feel like im getting tossed around without anything to keep me balanced ive lost friends and family im scared of not having anyone left ive tried different things: relationships food medication religion no matter what i hold on to it doesnt feel like anyone wants to care relationships have become meaningless food becomes poision medication puts you on more medication to fix the problems medications cause and religion is so often shunned or used as a weapon rather than love i just want something to focus on and focus on me back you know?,0
i struggle with this daily i force myself to get up because of my 4 yr oldi fight hard for him wish i knew how to get better,0
i was hoping to stay anonymous but wanted to respond to this - my managers were fully aware that the area ive been moved to exacerbated my anxiety yet moved me there anyway they arent interested in any kind of compromise,0
i have experienced the same symptoms as well i had a breakdown last year i was in the hospital for 10 days they put me on seroquel i was diagnosed with ptsd  bipolar major depression and panic disorder i dont know how i would be without it im not gonna sit here and say how bad it is  because for now i am as "normal" as im going to be you are not alone,0
eat a banana a day it helped me a lot with restless legs,1
im diagnosed everything and taking a lot of different meds and a few have worked and im still taking i know the struggle is real but have faith in yourself and youll find the right combination stay strong friend,1
i was taking rispedol and nothing for anxiety,1
susan newcombe  ur so so accurate my husband is suffering as u say overwhelming terrifying depression everyday is beyond terrible 4 both of us not being able to help him is dreadful nobody understands,1
yes iv been over anxious in build up to eclipse my normal meds not even dulling anxiety i often get this way during full moon tooi just do meditation to helpx,1
i constantly struggle with the fear that i will never be happy i have a loving caring understanding wife and an amazing intelligent creative and very loving four year old daughter i should be strengthened by their presence in my life yet i still feel crippled by fear and doubt ive been actively working on improving myself over the last six years and i feel like ive barely made it to where i should have been at 22-23 im 28 now being an extreme introvert and having an anxiety disorder ocd poor impulse control and fibromyalgia makes it feel impossible to be my best and be happy financial insecurity is also a problem sorry if this was just an unhelpful rant basically i struggle with happiness and have been told i dont know what joy is,0
i am also a recovering alcoholic i have been on xanax for 23 years at this point only 8 weeks sober he does not want me to detox off this drug just yet i am also bi polar 2 ptsd anxiety,1
i found it took months for lamictal to kick in and i struggled for months and still do if youre concerned talk to your doctor because there are other stabilizers out there i waited to talk to my doctor until i was on a stable dose because it keeps going up until the doctor thinks its appropriate to stop upping the dosage,1
when im bad i can masturbate up to 8 times a day and the more i cum the more shame i feel to the point im just depressed like when im in a healthy state of mind its once or twice a day but hypersexuality can be rough luckily the meds im on stave off a lot of those pesky side effects otherwise id be staring at asses and crotches all day unable to think about anything but whats under the clothes,0
i take 4 mg xanax a day but i really wouldnt recommend it because it is only a temporary fix and really hard to come off of my mom is bipolar (where i get it from) and she smokes pot and it really helps her also as melissa hutter has already mentioned withdrawals from benzos are pretty horrible i mean like diarrhea vomiting and flu like symptoms such as body aches and fever thats the worst withdrawal though just talk to your doctor and the both of you can determine what is right for you there are non-narcotic drugs that can relieve your anxiety as well,1
ive looked into both tms & ect ive been told that tms helps more with anxiety & depression but not other illnesses like bipolar,1
i really struggled with this for years i didnt take vacation because i didnt think single people did that my psychiatrist convinced me to go on a regular cruise and that really opened up my perspective i can have fun by myself because i push myself to meet at least one new person wherever i went just one person was not overwhelming when i got home i applied the same principal i meet one new person at the grocery store aisle in the checkout line at the park at church or the movies its really surprising how friendly and reassuring that one person can be,0
tell these ppl they have no clue what they are saying or talking about! and that bipolar is a far more serious issue then even jus an array of emotions at one time did u know that bipolar also causes serious physical health problems?! ask them if they know that!?! tell them they need to be more educated on sumthin b4 they go shooting off at the mouth! and u dont need to tell them its u that suffers tell them u know many close ppl that do not that u should be ashamed at all!!! thats like being ashamed that u have a limp or other defect from birth u cannot help how u were born i wear my bipolar proudly! i am exactly how god made me!,0
feel free to message me i have bipolar 1 temporal lobe epilepsy anxiety disorder adhd borderline personalitydisorder obsessive compulsive disorder and ptsd,1
seroquel xr 400 and klonopin for anxiety,1
hugs i also struggle with self harm and suicidal thoughts i wish i knew how old you are so i could try to help,0
healing must take place on all three planes of your existence: spiritual psychological & physical pray specifically about your bpd your symptoms your fears give thanks for triumphs there is power in jesus name also develop daily routines there is some comfort in sameness routines also help you guage the severity of downshifts towards bouts of depression anxiety attacks or the onset of a psychosis strictly care for youe body vitamin deficiencies can prompt the onset of depressive episodes and angry outbursts study study study yoursrlf your past your present your habits & all the "whys" of your life i am praying for you now,1
no doubt this has happened to me,0
its ultimately your choice but personally its the best choice i have ever made it took a while to get the right combo and the right doses but i have been doing great now for about 2 years still have some good d aha and bad days but no where near what they used to be!!! i can tolerate it and i like to say "pull it together" when i need to it will always be a struggle but the meds made things so so much better for me i see things so much clearer now,0
please goto a doctor dont be scared they wont hurt you they will help you can understand you a lot better they will listen to you and will try to help you out give yourself a chance self medication wont help you go for a professional treatment,1
ahh yes so true shame we have to hide sometimes,0
yes iam like this at times but they seem to wind us up too its not all what we say  but i am careful at times how i speak or i dont speak at all thats easier lol  try and think before we speak but i know when we get stressed its hard and all sorts come tumbling out  stay strong,0
i have bipolar disorder depression ocd and personality disorder i just want u 2 know i was diagnosed with depression when i had my daughter 8yrs ago i then went on to realise i had much more undiagnosed but was so afraid to tell my doctor the truth as the same as you was worried about the care of my daughter and to be judged as a bad parent many years went on and i met a new partner 4yrs ago and he picked up on it strait away i was in denial altho deep down i knew something was wrong it got to the point where i had to tell a doctor and in all honesty it was the best thing i ever done as they was so supportive and couldnt help me more my child is well looked after i told them as they do have to ask and the doctor and psychiatrist honestly take your word unless they have evidence to proof otherwise u need help and need to confined in a doctor before it gets too latei dont have panic attacks anymore i dont have anxiety i sleep i do everything i should be doing  but i do have 1 bad day out of say about 7 or 8 but it beats everyday life im so proud of getting the help and care i need for me and has helped my daughter 2 u reli should have a think about what is best for your children which means is best for you take care hun and get some help xxx,1
i totally agree with the first comment i too have a great life a truly amazing wife a brilliant (although admittedly sometimes stressful) job great friends about to move to a lovely new house and the future is looking great however i still want to pick up the courage to jump off the nearest bridge i have the urge but thankfully am resisting the urge to self harm every day its not circumstances its the brain doing stupid things! keep your head up we are all here for you x,0
im married to a toxic person its so hard listening to complaints about my sleep or being "lazy" constantly bringing up a friendship i had that made me feel good but he hated calling me names timing me when i leave i am not allowed to go out with anyone its a horrible life to live,0
even if you mentioned she hit you without proof they would not have been able to do anything i spent years in the exact same situation when i got tired of it and took off my mom did report me as a runaway to save face with the rest of the family they ended up helping her get me back in her house be prepared for anything is the only reason i tell you this i hope things go well and if you need encouragement and help there are peoplemake sure you know that when youre home and scared even strangers like us are only a message away,0
thank you for this validation! just today i was having to state my case to a family member who believes bipolar or depression is just a cop out to function normally believes meds only make it worse i tried explaining why this med helps in combo w my other meds all dr prescribed but it was just a losing battle its awful when your own mother doesnt validate mental illness as a legitimate illness like any other but i digress im grown dont require her approval or support even but all the judgment and blaming me for everything that is negative in everyones life and accusing me of using bipolar and anxiety as an excuse i could certainly do without this is a big enough battle to fight daily dont need more on top to fight im learning to let it go doesnt really matter in the end how she treats me anyway yeah?,1
crying is our bodys way to release stress so cry if you need to dont get angry when you do that crying is just like pooping do you get angry if you poop? no right? because your body needs it just think of it that way and if youre uncomfortable doing it in front of other people do it at night in your room or cr before you get overwhelmed by your emotions or just have a routine of doing it every night just like an exercise,0
what jennifer tenhagen has posted is very accurate so please take note of her advice as many people get confused your therapist has treated you very appropriately as only a psychiatrist can or should diagnose any medical disorder a therapist plays a very different yet valuable role,1
true only two times i avoided a depression that was coming for me was being marched for miles along the road and having a bath and my toddler popped a whole bottle of lavender oil in my bath it was very strong but i did not want to waste it it kept a depression away !!!,1
i know how you feel i felt thst way since i was 13 years old its crippling and you lose hope and faith i suffer from bipolar mdd psychosis anxiety/panic disorder and ptsd i was put on everything from the moon at back i finally underwent ect with keto mine treatment 16 rounds it wore off 2 months ago fearing i needed more ect i went back to my dr and we went with lithium vraylar quetiapine clonazepam it has been a great success i regained my hope and faith in life it took 25 yrs but i cant remember the last 6 years of my life which iam ok with there is still hope never stop looking try old medications with new ones theres something out there if it gets really bad try clozaril its not just for schizophrenia patients they treat hard to treat depression with it hang in there,0
if you know the anxiety comes with driving maybe talk to your therapist they know how to deal with it when you can pinpoint a certain phobia,0
im on it my dr is hoping it will help me with an added side effect of weight loss/appetite suppressant i definitely eat less i cant say ive lost weight im still just in starting stages of testing it to see if it is a good med for me (dr took me off depakote and replaced it with topomax im now up to 1 1/2 pills 2x for a week and then 2 pills 2x a day starting next week) paired with wellbutrin and adivan for anxiety bipolar2 and clinical depression im beginning to feel a little bit normal again its still early and i still have rough days but its getting better,0
never hide your struggles whether you tell just one person or your whole circle is up to you you need someone in your corner that will help you when you need and who knows what you struggle with me personally i suffer from depression and anxiety and kept it to myself for years and it got really bad a few months ago but i told my two best friends and they have been able to help me when i feel it coming on they know my struggles and they help you need someone to help you seriously even having just one person to share this burden will ease it so much for you,0
christopher gravelle if we could all talk to someone we know then we wouldnt need this forum its not for miserable trolls with free time on their hands find something to do with your life because being funny isnt working for you,0
i was a cutter for 12 years have not cut now for 6 years it is an addiction and it actually helps to treat it as such on the road to your recovery start with trying 1 day without cutting and go from there have a reward system in place for when you succeed there will be stumbles but keep pushing through i suffer from cptsd and bipolar i still get urges to self harm when im overwhelmed but when i do i look at my scars and just how far i have come you can do it you will move past it and you will be stronger for it all the best xx,0

take her phone away i know that sounds extreme but without it to distract her she will get bored and start doing things like looking for a job make a role if she is going to live with you that she has to take meds lastly dont enable her my parents did all 3 and though i was really upset at first it helped in the long run maybe consider yoga or meditation i can understand her position as i have bipolar and really struggled and still do sometimes to be adult ultimately its going to come down to her will if she wants better things in her life than you have to put in work or go the lazy way and put her on disability just dont cave and not do anything,0

i have the same problem when im having an anxiety attack i go through the motions of throwing up usually nothing comes up unless i just ate im finally on clonidine klonopin and atarax havent had an episode since i have felt like i was going to have an anxiety attack i stave it off by lying down or talking myself through it or go to the bathroom and wait it out,0

bipolar is bipolar so yep you can be bipolar without taking meds i would never not take my meds because i know i am bipolar and have no desire to have episodes like i can have without my meds we will always be bipolar theres no cure but meds can help with the horrible episodes helps me recognize i am falling into one,1
im going through something similar n just reading through the comments has made me feel a little less guilty abt cutting people off being part of this group has saved me many times thanku ,0
these feelings are symptoms not truth and god is the one person who never has any bad feelings about you ever his approval of you doesnt have conditions thats the kind of love you probly never experienced either i dont know if you have a counselor but they do help they are the steady person when we are in chaos and they understand the struggle more than most people,0
step away from such a person a true friend would never risk distressing you for their own entertainment,0
im on citalopram 20mg for depression i deal with anxiety as well but dont take anything for it i take it once a day just be careful taking all those medications ,1
i use olanzapine its a mood stabiliser antipsychotic and it provides a calm from anxiety im also on lithium and mirtazapine all 3 can cause weight gain so im not sure which one or all to it but it has been the best for me outside medication i also use mindfulness it has been a godsend its easy to do you practice while you are feeling ok so when you start to feel anxious you can use it check it out online you can even get apps for your phone,1
people hear what they want hear some times when you are so stressed out you cant cope with everything that is around you it to much people don understand what you go though you try to say what your going through it best to say nothing let say what they want say you understand what go on with you and just adored them they slang off some one else people should judge you they should judg themselves and leave you alone xxx,0
4-7-8 breathing technique shown to reduce anxiety by 65% ,1
have your primary care or gyn do a hormone test check your thyroid and other possibly unrelated things that could be exacerbating your diagnosis especially during your time of the month thats probably a good start not always is it just a mental health issue and if there is any even the slightest increase of stress in your life can cause significant changes keep a journal and document it all and see if you cant pick up over the course of months what your pattern looks like and then take it to the doctor and let them help figure it out and the wrong medication could be doing you worse than good have you tried alternative therapy and treatments? if you are bipolar i suggest an antidepressant and mood stabilizer and something for the anxiety attacks and i really suggest trying marijuana for all of it your life will see the changes positively if your open to trying something different! i cant express it enough even with it being illegal in most states the statistics dont lie about its ability to effect the nervous system in a calming manner my opinion though,1
actually i really appreciate you asking valeda! basically i am prescribed a medication which if it works the effects only last a limited amount of time this time limit can be as short as a month or as long as 3 - but never usually more than that amount of duration i have been on so many different medications that my dr is basically running out of things to prescribe in my last few sessions he has suggested that i should consider electric convulsive therapy - which i wont do as ive done a fair amount of research and feel that the risk brain injury from this type of therapy is not something i am willing to risk for myself,1
even recovery rooms can be extremely stressful some patients do not come out of anesthesia well at all- having screaming and violent episodes (through no fault of their own),0
some meds give me weird vivid dreams but dont worry dreams dont count,1

i was never trying to guilt them out of the thoughts more asking them to think about the people around them everybody has somebody who cares dearly for them even if they dont feel that way,0
zoloft/sertraline is one of the safest meds to be on during pregnancy i went back on it toward the end of my second pregnancy because my anxiety was getting bad again i was also very concerned about my baby having withdrawals etc i seem to remember my dr telling me anything under 100mg was negligible and the babies she had seen go through withdrawal after birth cried more for a day or two and then were fine breastfeeding wasnt an issue for me on the sertraline (off name for zoloft) i also breastfeed on psych meds with my first (cipralex) and everything was fine too again zoloft is one of the safest meds for pregnancy/breastfeeding something i want you to know before this baby comes: your cup needs to be full in order to pour into others (your babys) lives i have gone way too long trying to fill my family up from an empty cup and it does not work your health needs to come as a priority so that you can be as happy and healthy a mama as you can be good luck hun ,0

i have severe anxiety disorder and take paroxetine ive been on it now for 12 years i only take 20mg it really helps me best advise is to let your doctor know that what he prescribed doesnt work,1
marae corday the system is overwhelmed because it is chronically and terribly under-resourced has been for a long time your self-stigma and community stigma of mental health is part of the problem we need to be part of the solution - wake up!,1
*the truth im about to share with you could hurt your feelings just a heads up but the truth hurts" coming from someone who just called off my engagement and 5 year long relationship that type of shit does not change if he cheated on you and seems like he doesnt care about putting in the effort to understand the struggles you have with your mental health then he doesnt care im brutal with the truth and if you have to question whether they care that means they dont because if a man loves you you know he loves you without a shadow of a doubt men are usually an "eye on the prize" type so if he doesnt care you will know it by how he makes you feel im sorry you are going through this,0
ok i have voices in my head at night time about my past thinking of my mum and dad and friends its like im there but im not and when i awake its gone its only when im asleep and sometimes it stops me from sleeping not sure what you call it but it can be disturbing,0
i think it could be suggesting that even if you have a mental illness and struggle being a mum never stops,0
we are so similar! haha i commented to your comment above too! hubby also reminds me because ill just turn my alarm off and think to myself "oh ill take them in a minute  or when this show is over" any excuse and then forget lol! ~dani,1

i love cymbalta been on it a while now but suppose to be taken off all my psych meds in the next coming months as my partner and i are going to be trying to become pregnant and worried about the withdrawal,1
yeah you kinda put yourself in a corner saying you want a job that is not so stressful i would start looking for one that is not as stressful and you will feel so much reilf i had a bad job i would cry before and cry after i am disabled and had a special paper filled out they couldnt fire me but i got a lot of shit and when the project closed and i didnt have the job i was amazed how great it was not having stress now i have a job that is so mellow i love it i wish you well and hope you find whats best for you,0
thank you i sometimes feel like my thoughts and sadness are just in my head and i need to just snap out of it but ive tried to "just snap out of it"it doesnt work so i just kind of "coast through life" with the fake smile and the "im oks" then i feel guilty because my issues arent "real" issues then im angry for feeling like this and then the pretending like its all ok the never ending cycle of ups and downs i sometimes feel like im living "groundhog day" over and over and over how do i deal with this never ending feeling of hopelessness? i just cant no matter how hard i try or how much i read about it or how hard i try to lie to myself that it will all be ok,0

i understand your frustration while my circumstances are different in many ways im similar i can leave my house but i also want desperately to be a functional member of society i want to work so badly unfortunately it can take time medication also isnt a quick fix i have bipolar 2 and ptsd my depression was very severe but it can and will get better you just need to be patient if you have been on this med a while it might be worth trying something else it could also be an idea to ask your psychiatrist for a second opinion keep fighting i assure you it will get better *hugs*,1
i have depression anxiety and ptsd i have a sister who is schizophrenic when it comes to word phrasing it would be correct to either say she is schizophrenic or she has schizophrenia both phrases are correct i know depression is not the same as being bi polar that wasnt my point,1
thats an ssri isnt it? you might have high levels of serotonin (maybe dopamine as well?) already some people with certain gene mutations react badly to ssri for that reason if its really bad low doses of no flush niacin can calm the anxiety from it temporarily def tell the doc!,1
dont be afraid of your diagnosis be happy you have gotten one and can now begin to understand your moods and how to manage them this is the beginning of something better for you!,0
i know this feeling this struggle is real and scary to at times,0
i dont agree with some of these like "dont take it personally" or "theres no reason to be afraid of me" if we dont want our own feeling invalidated we shouldnt do it to others been living with bpd a long time and ive lost people i love because it was too much for their own hearts to handle i dont fault them at all the majority is great though and i absolutely relate,0
first off feel free to private message me if you want to talk second ive been off meds now for 3 years i came off of them in 2014 so that i could conceive my first son we knew after my oldest was born that we would want more children and since i was on lithium which is hard to get on and off of we decided just to keep me off of my meds im now almost 36 weeks pregnant with our second child im due in mid-september after my first son was born i had postpartum depression during the pregnancy i did really well until the end when my anxiety got high this time around i havent been doing so great and i wouldnt recommend asking me any questions unless you want my gods honest truth experience i dont lie to people but if you want more information feel free to message me im happy to talk or at the very least if things get rough im happy to be a shoulder because trust me i understand,0
i was on lithium 1600mgs/day over 15 years i too went from 130 to 204 i too was put on synthroid for hypothyroidism i was also on a few other psych medsseroquel zoloft and 8mgs of xanax/day i was a walking (fat) zombie after years of research and a life changing event i finally took matters into my own hands this was after years of self education i stopped every med except xanax which i went to 3mgs instead of 8 switched from zoloft to effexor and contiued taking the thyroid meds nearly 3 months later my weight dropped from 204 to 160 now almost 2 years later i am 135lbs my mind is so much clearer my body is finally back to the way i remember it being big pharma will dose you your whole life if you dont take a stand! being bipolar is hard enough but being overweight doubles the depression i realized i needed to get better for me!! i started talking walks which then led to hikes then i started swimming which led to learning to kayak which is now my favorite hobby stopping all of those meds was scary but in the end so worth it! being sooo medicated made me basically lose out on being 30 something bc i honestly cant remember my 30s im 41 now and i feel better all around nowmentally and physically i also found god during my process which i feel like that in itself is the biggest trophy of my life without god i would not have been able to go off all those psych meds and keep what little sanity i had left i thought lithium was the best drug ever invented to control my moods however now that i am not on a mood stabilizer my faith gets me through the rollar coasters i dont suggest doing anything without intense education and research i have found cannabis to be my natural stabilizer i never thought id be able to live taking just 3 prescriptionsconsidering there were times in my life when i was on 14 different psych medications at oncewho can keep up with so many? no wonder i dont remember my 30slol im now 41 and my mental health and my physical health are better than ever! also my sex drive came back after 12 years of thinking it was gone forever!! yes im bipolar ocd sad ptsdthose illnesses do not define who i am todayi am me! i will post 2 pictures and you will see the difference,1
im sorry about that glad you have disability that helps take some worry away does your county offer any type of counseling? mine does and thats who prescribes my meds i went to counseling for about 2 years and it helped but i quit going last year im tired of talking about my past im trying to focus to my health and my life im 50 years old and i speak from experience that it can get better i have a hard time with crowds over like 20 people i go to church that is very small and most of the people are very elderly that helps me because it helps my need to care for someone and i can be myself and they love me i can relate to being 20 and having issues you have my prayers and support,0
they sell pill boxes with an alarm on them check amazon,0
i have been in this spot my ex made it worse he said same cruel things and that i was insane ive been diagnosed with bi polar and am on meds everyday and now im doing great i have 3 kids under 12 single mum and trying now to get a day job in school hours even with meds you have down days and thats where you dont listen to negative crap and be stronger in yourself if i can do it anyone can bi polar ocd anxiety,0
i was very nauseous for two weeks the until it settled i stayed on the venlefaxine for a year and a half and it eventually stopped working so my doc upped my dosage and it was a horrible experience once he did it manifested my depression more and more so i was weined off of it and switched to ciprilex 10 mg and it has made a huge difference i love the way it has helped me cope and stopped my bad thoughts i highly recommend ciprilex it has little to no side effects and didnt make me nauseous at all good luck,1
he obviously dont care how you feel let alone he will never understand you im sorry you struggle this way and i know just how difficult it can be im sorry for him throwing away someone so special take care be strong and remember youre not alone,0
oh gosh honey you are differently going thru alot why not try to get ssi? i was also a self harmer many years ago i know when i got overwhelmed it did help but there are many other things you can do the only think that helped me when i was anorexic it was all about control over never ending feeling you can do this for you and no one else if you need to go to the hospital then go and if intakes your family thats to bad i can definitely understand where you come from with your family keep your head yo and god bless you,0
does he drink a lot of caffeine? caffeine is a stimulant and will make anxiety worse limit caffeine 4-6 hours before bedtime a body pillow maybe with your moms clothes/ scent on it? i find something solid in bed with me thats comforable helps if its possible or if you havent already tried it a critter like a dog might help make him feel safer in his own room i would be careful with the melatonin though because prolong use will make it less effective im using valarian root right now which is also supposed to help with anxiety chamomile tea is great you could also try st johns wort but as with any medication check to make sure its not going to interfere with anything else if hes taking other meds good luck!,1
i have taken it for psychiatric purposes it didnt agree with me but i think im more of the exception than the rule a friend of mine that has als takes it for her als it can be used for nerve pain as well lyrica is the best for nerve pain however lyrica induced depression in me ive heard so many uses for it although i also have never heard it prescribed for anxiety dont be discouraged by my experience i have met plenty of people that it works well for stay in close touch & be totally honest with your dr be patient its well worth it in the end:-),1
thats how i feel when i sleep i dont feel the anxiety and panic attacks i just cant get enough sleep sometime completely no energy specially with the meds i take make me have no energy exercise help when i force myself its hard and depressing,1
klonopin can create anxiety as it wears off id be more concerned about the klonopin than the new drug,1
ah i remember doing these exact things sadly except the working part and had to go between only two doctors and feeling somewhat of a relief after the sessions from what i can assume perhaps you should take your prescribed medication that your doctor has given you before work i am diagnosed as a bi polar psychotic and have real bad anxiety as well i take lorazepam and risperidal,1
me with depression and anxiety several police interventions 1 legal hold and 4 hospitalizations 2x in a partial hospitalization program a couple of suicide attempts abandoned and isolated cant trust anyone can hardly function on a day to day basis hate this disease was actually a licensed independent clinical therapist before i lost everythingwhen im manic im unstoppable when im depressed i can hardly get out of bed what happened? people say you can still live a full and productive life with this disease i ask how?,0
i had uncontrollable leg and arm movements and allergic reaction to the drug,0
it is wonderful how supportive youre being please keep doing it - as long as its not negatively affecting you with my depression i often shut people out and its awful to watch friendships die but being powerless to do anything to stop it i feel so blessed when ive been super distant from people due to anxiety and depression but several people continue to text and call and when im ready to talk theyre available and nothing between us has changed you are a wonderful person for not giving up on your friend,0
look for another job in a way that wont let him find out that where there is no conflict once you get one get out of there being in a toxic relationship or with someone that cheats or is abusive can give you ptsd itself i have been cheated on and i understand the anxiety aspect of that it takes over your every thought im so sorry you have to go through this i am just getting out of a toxic relationship and leaving was one of the hardest things ive ever done,0
yeah anxiety is very hard to deal with i take 2mg xanax 3 times daily and still have anxiety,1
well i have bipolar i  borderline anxiety bulemia ocd ptsd and one specific symptom is hypersexuality since i was a child,1
thanks curtis  that was very supportive and encouraging im glad im not as alone as i thought i was  ive had many failed attempts as well i dont know how ive survived this long eitheri think about suicide a lot to and i think about how i will end my life i would say i would probelly fantasize it as well at times when i think about it i get jealous of ppl who succeed in committing suicide becuz that could be mei to cant wait for the day i can rest in peace and i doubt it will be in this lifetime thats why i feel like suicide is my only option at times  sad but trueyes i totally agree i cant wait till i dont have to hurt the way i hurt or feel the terrible deep intense dark feelings that i feel its a nightmare i also get jealous of those who dont suffer with mental health issues cuz i agree i definitely think its totally unfairits hard to accept it though i just started working with a new therapist once a week for a hour  shes been very nice and is helping me not hold in my feelings and emotions as much and working on my negative thinking and self hate issues i hope it continues to be a helpful and productive therapy for me cuz its going well so far but ive only been seeing her for maybe three weeks or so but shes been great and very supportive and she understands my struggles with depression and anxiety im trying to change my thinking when i get suicidal which is very often  my therapist wants to make a pact with her i guess before i hurt myself or attempt suicide i have to reach out but thanks again for the nice message it really made my night and im feeling better for now  its great to know maybe a few ppl still understand and care about what im going thru  i appreciate it,0
early last year i allowed somebody (formerly) close to me shame me for my reliance on meds for my mental illnessi am bipolar and have complex ptsd from both child abuse and combati stopped for 4 monthsim still struggling to completely come back from the damage i did to my lifeit was a train wreckso nowin addition to my core issuesi have major regret for the choices i made and the way i acted in those dark unmedicated monthstake your meds and be grateful your man loves you enough to even give you an opportunity to fix thisitooam blessed to have a husband who knows i am not my behavior and hes been longsufferingbelieve mebe a responsible grown-up and take your medicineits by far the lesser of 2 evils,0
my daughter is going through the same thing its so hard to watch! we recently had a genetic test done (google genesight testing) that tested her dna with over 500 psychiatric medications including antidepressants mood stabilizers and anxiolytics it turns out that most of the meds she had been on werent able to be metabolized by her body so the meds never worked they gave us a report on the meds that will work and now she has hope again it might be worth a try! i think of all the years and money spent on medications that never worked and all the time shes endured the depression and anxiety waiting the 4 to 6 weeks for the meds to work and they never did im sorry youre in this dark place too right now i hope things start to get better for you and thought this might be a suggestion for you to think about good luck <3,1
its a long arduous journey finding the right meds!!!! & hospitals can be scary places too! look into genetic testing for what meds will work best with your dna instead of waiting weeks/ months & side effectswe see clients 2-3 times per week & have each patient closely monitored every 2 weeks by their prescriber to keep u stable & avoid hospitalizations good luck heres sum info to start later,1
zonisamide followed by lithium both are mood stabilizers with agents designed to swat anxiety!,0
my son was on it for years with good results screwed up his thyroid and much later on gave him horrible acne almost boils on his back after years it quit working then there is the blood tests but i would say it is worth a shot in taking some people know right away if they cant take it because of the blood work,1
i was really bad about not taking my meds after i start feeling better and every single time  weeks or months later i crash and burn for the past 3 months i have been taking me meds everyday like prescribed and i havent crashed and i feel "normal"  what i think everyone else feels like i knew better than to stop taking them i knew what would happen i dont know why i would do it there are side effects of the meds but i would rather deal with side effects than live without the medication and depression anxiety and mood swings,1
vistaril worked enough to where i could work myself the rest of the way out of my panic attack,1
im perscribed meds but i dont take them i struggle everyday to function my family n friends try to tell me i need them,0
but keep in mind even though lithium works great there will come a day it stops working out of the blue for no reason been there done that i myself am manic bipolar anxiety attacks panic attacks phrenia border personality disorder ptsd ect i have 3 pages front and back full of medicine that didnt work after lithium stopped working after a year today i take 150mg antitripline and 30 mg prosac and it works like a charm i couldnt take valium xanex or kolinipin cuz after 10 yrs i developed a adverse reaction and kept ending up in jail and not able to remember why also check into seraqual it will put u to sleep i promise,1
horrible even when i tapered off i had itching all over my body and had to take benedryl for like a month and a half this can happen because seroquel has antihistimine in it and your body is used to having a certain amount running through it and when it dwindles you can itch terribly,1
unfortunately a lot of ppl live with that stigma but what they dont understand is that its hard to get the help needed and deal with everyday life too ive heard that only weak ppl go to "crazy farms" but personally i think that only the strongest ppl are willing to try anything to get the help they need and deserve! financial issues will always be a problem and to that i say the risk is worth the reward and there is always bankruptcy finances shouldnt hold ppl back from feeling better good luck to you ,0
hi im on 300 mg of zoloft it took a good 2 yrs to work properly & i still have bad days im also on neulactil for anxiety & high adrenalin i used to be on effexor slow release tablet but i had to stop them due to having heart attack & effexor make ur heart beat fast which my heart could not handle anymore cos i get tacky cardia & angina i dont think theres a tablet out there that will fix depression completly  hey i could be wronge,1
im bipolar 1 have anxiety and bpd mum of 5 2 of which are step kids 3 my own mental health is triggered through trauma as a child i was abused physically mentally and sexually best thing to do is take your meds get a mood diary go to all appointments maybe get you psychiatrist to refer you in to classes which are absolutely fab ive done anxiety and coping skills ans have helped me so much if you ever need a chat feel free to pm me always be honest with you child though ive always spoke openly about my mental health to my babies so when my bad days come they understand its me and not them also family support makes it easier too xx,0
sueanna arnold-folsom nothing wrong with masturbation its normal and relieves stress,0
there are some that feel prayer will cure cancer that scares me a little i liken it to "you wouldnt tell a diabetic not to take their meds but you shun mental illness?",1
cant say it enough talk to your dr - some meds need others to work better or that med might be to strong but when we first get put on meds to help our minds get what it needs we do sometimes crash you probably have not slept good in a long time so your body will make up for that once the mind is getting the right amount of meds it needs we all go threw guilt you have to remind yourself you took a step to make your and your son and familys life better you have taken control,1
im bipolar ii and only on effexor right now i need something for anxiety but im,1
i highly relate to all of the above n its horrible its like your trapped inside a bubble full of water and everyone around you is oblivious to it they cant help you because they dont no how to or they dont notice the difference in you,0
i am on medication for bipolar 1 you may start to feel a mood change like you are happy one minute and 60 sec later you are angry with the world i dont have really hypermania but i am very depressed with severe anxiety i take clonazepam lamicital sertraline and trazodone it helps a lot i am trying to get the right doses my mood is the biggest lamictal helps with that however with counseling and learning to cope with our medication helps a lot but i know several ppl who are on medication for bipolar hope that helps,1

im only 21 years old ive already been on lots on medication that hasnt helped and had counselling which helped for about 5 minutes but now its worse i never want to go out because of my depression and anxiety i have to be made to go out otherwise i just wouldnt i work 6 days a week which is hard for me some days every day i have at least one person saying to me why do you look so miserable all of time or pick your face up off the ground or snap out of it which makes me feel worse cause it doesnt matter how many times you tell them people you cant help it they still make you feel crap and just dont understand people who dont suffer with depression honestly do not get it and it is very frustrating im not living anymore im just exsisting additional comment from the original poster,0
crying only makes it worse but it is an outlet for the depression then i get a migraine damned if you do damned if you dont i totally understand not wanting to be on more meds i dont like being on all that im on but ive come to accept that i need them and probably will for the rest of my life ive tried going off of a few and it was a disaster it was to the point where i shouldve been hospitalized but i just wouldnt put that worry on my kids,0
thats every night  for those who judge fine by me but if you have a kid growing up and his/her life begins to change well after puberty wish your judgementel ass the best!! not a day or night goes by that in someway bending me bipolaranxietymanic and god depression sits in days to weeksweeks to many months before any relief!! judge on!!,1
seroquel knocked me out my maintenance guy came by to fix the sink i tried to get up but couldnt move my body was asleep but i could hear him talking weight gain as well ive been on cymbalta for 3yrs and helps with my depression im back on ativan for anxiety though i am feeling much better now,0
my mental health doctors have told me to carry on smoking! but my gp doctor has told me to cut down it helps with my anxiety and anger too so sod what anyone says! x,1
had to breath slow and steady all day anxiety all day,0
also i did this last summer with my boyfriends son its called time out bottle i called it a snow globe and did as an art project with him you mix water clear glue and sparkles in a water bottle and mix it up the idea is for them to shake it and watch it the sparkles settle while they sit in time out when its down they are down and calmed down its really actually calming i did one in one of those tinny airplane alcohol bottles to keep in my pocket book for those out in public break downs,1
im not sure about your dr you should not just stop a med like that please dont hesitate to go to the hospital to get help,1
i totally understand! no one will understand mental illness because it scares the shit out of them for me i am always remembered for all the mistakes i made or for one sister doesnt believe in my diagnosis she also resented my going on disability my brother has a wife who cant stand me and he thought that every time i called him i was trying to ask him to bail me out again things i did before i got diagnosed and got on medication but he still judges me and sees me as that other person he was the one person who i thought would start to understand bpd because he got reading material i suggested but it didnt matter my whole family and history is pretty crazy ya know? so after my first suicide attempt i thought that i had really burnt some bridges the only one that has been there through it all has been my sister nancy i cannot tell you how much we have grown i made a decision to move away from my family so that i could learn to stand on my own two feet while it has been a bumpy ride it has been the right thing to do i have a companion in my life who i am learning to love freely and in turn learning to love myself my advice to you try to find your own way in the world and people who will love you exactly as you are your family is never going to change so except it and move on you are an amazing person for the journey and the obstacles you have overcome! start to separate from your family there is a world out there that is so amazingly beautiful you just have to take that step!,0

lol i was afraid to keep reading like yup damn another one,1
im currently on it to help me sleep and use 25mgs just when needed i used it earlier in the year also for anxiety i love it! it helped reduce the anxiety/panic to a manageable level and it helped me sleep deeply at night without that awful drugged hangover feeling you get from sleeping pills and apparently it isnt addictive although as im trying to cut down the usage i have to wonder if it is addictive or maybe im just addicted to a decent nights sleep lol?,1
suicide isnt selfish - its a last desperate act by a human who is suffering so much agony they think that dying is the best solution  why do we as society try to put blame on or label something like this instead of asking how or why they ended up thinking that way? selfish is ignoring someone who is suffering that much selfish is labeling them as crazy or selfish or needing to just get over it selfish is pushing aside questions that need to be asked for the quick and easy answer of "they where just selfish and thought only of themselves" dont blame yourself for someone elses decision to end their life dont blame them for making that decision either whats the point? will assigning blame bring them back? will being able to label it really make things better? no it wont - in fact it will probably only serve to make you feel worse mental anguish is an epidemic that is spreading at alarming rates - and we still refuse to ask the right questions we still just want something or someone to blame  isnt that selfish?,0
julie michelle gray i have done it without meds and it made me miserable i hated life couldnt enjoy anything but mine is not just bipolar i have ptsd depression anxiety bipolar and adhd so yes i am medicated better than be sucidial,1
my mom has been on antidepressants and anxiety medication for nearly 25yrs now for so long it seemed nothing would work shes now on cymbalta and rexulti and is a completely different person! in a good way! everybody is different and will react differently to certain medication take it as prescribed and if you notice any side effects call your doctor immediately! they are not going to give you something if they dont think itll work for you and your diagnosis best of luck to you!,1
tell them dont be ashamed!,0
take a deep breath i have experienced everything you have mentioned at one time or another make sure you stay in close contact with your dr i lived in constant fear that tomorrow would bring something that would cause me to give up nights are hard for me so i made me tell myself "itll all be better in the morning" i know it will never be better but concentrating on only making it till morning seems to be manageable,0
ive been working as a therapist for 10 years theres only 11 disorders i regularly treat yet no 2 clients are ever the same there are massively differing severities of the same condition ranging from functional when the person can work well to the other extreme where hospitalisation is needed there are times when i tell a client to keep working because the routine is good for their depression or the anxiety is manageable with support and avoidance would worsen the anxiety however there are also times when i would encourage someone to remove stresses like work from their lives so they can focus on getting good at managing the basics lots of people have the same diagnosis but treatment and advice will vary for the individual pip application is difficult if you are able to get an advocate or advice from cab it may assist you in navigating the process best wishes to you emma-jane naude,1
understand but still struggle worth this daily,0
there is nothing wrong with effexor my daughter takes it and it has totally changed her life for the better she used to have such social anxiety the one thing about antidepressants and mood stabilizers is that they dont work on everyone the same way i have been on many different ones over the years i have taken viibryd for the last 2 years and my doctor just added cymbalta i dont think that is the correct spelling,1
difficulty sleeping makes dealing with life overwhelming connect with a dr who can refer you to a psychiatrist and should send you for therapy i believe medication is only part of the solution in the mean time do some research for cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness mindfulness is great for anxiety and wonderful for racing thoughts when trying to get to sleep there are a lot of resources in the net but of course a face to face consultation is always better,1
of course lots of people have very negative reactions to aripiprazole i was one of them abilify and celexa were the first two antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications i was prescribed when i was diagnosed ten years ago together they made me gain 40 pounds increased my agitation and made me suicidal ive since taken several genetic tests and determined my resistance to the drugs is primarily genetic and biochemical i cant handle ssris and many antipsychotics i have friends and family members who have successfully managed their depression with the same drugs that were terrible for me dozens of medications later i am still trying to find the right combination for me i know many people who have seen life-changing results for the better after taking these medications under strict clinical guidance the most important thing is to see a professional on a consistent basis to monitor your medications or better yet several well-trained and credible psychiatrists and psychotherapists who have extensive experience and knowledge of the effects of these drugs so they can prescribe them with caution make sure your doctors are up-to-date with the most recent pharmaceutical research and clinical trials psychiatric research is always evolving and drugs are constantly being tested as new information becomes available about their effects,1
i hadnt cut for 5 years but last week i ended up cutting myself hoping i dont decide to again cause of this struggle of getting my medicaid reapproved because the state has not yet accepted it yet so i can get my mood enhancers so im not flipping shit,0
dont panic its organic! hhoo ,0
fear and loathing in las vegas,0

i am taking buspar currently on 225 mg twice a day and i think it is helping- it is non addictive and i too wanted to limit my use of benzos as they are my drug of choice when i get crazy you can go up to 30 mg twice a day- i started slowly and worked up and i feel a lot less anxious worried and irritable i had to ask my doctor if i could try it- either he doesnt prescribe it often or just did not understand the anxiety component to my bipolar 1 disease,1
i understand its hard i had to get away from my boyfriend because he was always yelling and punching things with his anger issues and all and it made my depression and anxiety much worse,0
i am worried because this is mw atm and having a wisdom tooth infection only makes it easier to excuse not interacting with others :p hope you are ok reets,1
my dr had me try lexapro after i refused seroquel then cymbalta and finally wellbutrin the last one was awful for me felt horrible for 7-10 days dizzy and felt like the room was spinning i just stopped taking it i am done trying antidepressants!,0
yeah definitely i have depression and anxiety and i often fall asleep around 2 3pm constantly worrying about things makes us so tired,1
i am with you i am rapid cycling right now i have a new dr and is switchin everything around and im going thru some serious life changing bull shit i am so tited of everything i just cant deal aanymore its so overwhelming idk who to even talk to any more i did talk to my wife but nowim too bipolar for her its just nutsso i feel your pain hang in there thats alaa we cando best wishes,0
i have worked up to 300 mg daily for about a year now it helps stabilize my depression and anxiety it keeps me off of cigarettes i love it; but results may vary blah blah blah,1
vistiril is basically an antihistamine that works on anxiety its an amped benedryl it worked when i took it until i built a tolerance,1
if you arent feeling ok and feel like youre in need of help to the point of considering hospitalization i recommend doing it i spent a while researching places to go and during that hesitation i did something that landed myself there anyway id say go theres a chance you wont be as lucky as i was,0
taking any medicine while trying or during pregnancy should be avoided or minimised based on the risks of taking or not taking the medication as clonazepam is a benzodiazepine there is a risk that your baby will suffer withdrawal when born as drug will pass through your systems to babies you and your dr need to discuss pros and cons of stopping or continuing i dont think clonazepam has specific risks to foetal development,1
if you have high blood pressure there is only one diuretic that you can take with lithium or you will stop making urine an start retaining such huge amount of fluids that you will get elephantitis,1
you know i experienced voices calling my name also i would turn off everything in the house and then go around to the computer stereo tv etc and listen for sound nothing but i still heard the voices i also had symptoms very similar to yours the sexuality spending racing thoughts all unable to control but i do not think i was aware that they represented something wrong with me at the time that does not mean you do not need care i have severe bipolar with depression and anxiety and take a lot of meds including seroquel i was hospitalized 4x one a legal hold ive been on the seroquel for 2+ years and have begun to gain weight back after a huge weight loss when not accurately diagnosed with bipolar i do not seem to be as sedated as other people mentionbut i am very unproductive in day to day activities i take many medications zolpidem temazepam valium zoloft tegretol hydroxyzine + more and yes meds are expensive and have many side effects i agree that major depression is probably one part of your diagnosis and you are experiencing symptoms that also still need to be addressed it is a daily challenge and a continual process never ending bs that is your life please keep going,1
i was on all those pills plus some i have bi polar anxiety depression and insomnia my bf hated me so i quit them all at once now i eat vegan and excersise i do love my alcohol and essential oils the pills arent good in my opinion,1
i am in a some what similar situation i left someone i care about a lot but it just got to the point were the relationship was destroying me and my life she is currently hospitalised as cruel as it sounds its given me calm and time to repair financial damage but the amount guilt is unreal i really do not know what else to do for her she has 2 kids from previous relationship that are now with the dad shes run up serious debts at the same time as emotionally (and occasionally physically) ripping me to pieces appreciate theres no benefit to you but i can relate to a degree,0
i do everyday its a struggle,0
yes go to the doc! your body undergoes so many changes during pregnancy that what used to work may not anymore i was finally put on anxiety meds in my 8th month of pregnancy because my anxiety was spiking my blood pressure so high! i would go to your obgyn and see if he/she had any advice on what to try that will not affect your baby i got my prescription from mine because i trusted him to know the affects better than my gp would,1
omy yes i cant hold my arms over my head or up at all for too long i had to buy a wig not only due to hair lossrelated to stressbut because i just cant do my hair any longer without feeling so dizzy ill pass out i just dont even bother anymore,0
i am in no way an expert but i think maybe you should have your dr put you on some newer drugs to try i am bipolar 1 ptsd social anxiety disorderand chronic depression i take wellbutrin in the morning plus a cans afternoon i have cans at bedtime i take two xanax and venlfaxine it works for me it manages all of my illnesses,1
if you follow your heart were you are scared and feel insecured go for what will give you peace of mind and the opportunity to heal your choice would affect your kids and family directly or indirectly you dont need stress wish you all the best get well,0
i know how hard it is to talk to people with social anxiety clouding all your thoughts but talking to each other and probably with a professional as well if possible it really is the best and only answer try to figure our how to help each other i would give almost anything to have another person in my life who was similar dont let yourself get further away,0
believe me i show you much more than anyone i still have lots of work to do but i trust you completely i hope you feel the same you can share anything with me li no worries,0
i dont feel these things life since a very young girl has always been a constant struggle for me in some form or another ive never been in the normal range but could mix with them the job part can be the most trying due to my meds giving me some bad days but i dont regret me how could i?,0
their music helped me through so many hard times before i found out about my depression and even more so now that ive been diagnosed with anxiety and bipolar disorder,1
ok but now im stressing out that my brain isnt functioning correctly ,0
actually i have this issue i call this more to do with paranoia that can stem from any mental disorder and not bpd in itself this is not only bpd and from the this is written it comes across strongly as if this is only bpd and a symptom,1
some meds may help but some may cause anhedonia good luck ,1
im bipolar ii along w anxiety & panic disorder well at least that my current diagnosis they seem to have changed along the years according to multiple drs but i want you to know you are not alone even though it feels like it most of the time i have almost identical symptoms to yours,0
i hadnt thought of that and i have no idea if theres a connection but i always get hypomanic at the same time every month but this time its lasting a lot longer than usual-- i cant shake it and im also very depressed if weather can give me headaches who knowsmaybe theres something to this never say never i just wish itd go away,0
i think this is a great question! i always call people out on that but i do it discreetly so they dont feel embarrassed plus they usually listen if they dont feel threatened i say something like "i know you mean no harm by that but please take a moment to consider your listeners- maybe they have a loved one with bp and using mental illness as a joke only perpetuates their feelings of isolation" be kind to them and respectful and youd be surprised how many positive responses youll get good luck!,0
i have suffered with severe chronic depression for almost 20 years when i was at my lowest i felt exactly like this individual therapy group therapy and the right medication helped me get out of that hole but it took almost 5 years before i could see any semblance of my old self every single day is still a struggle but at least i feel as though it is worth fighting through there are a few things i remind myself of daily - i will never be the happy funny outgoing girl i used to be but thats okay because depression taught me how to empathize forgive and accept; although i am lucky in many ways does not diminish the impact my depression has on my life; most people who make rude comments are just ignorant about mental illness not intentionally mean or hurtful; being content can feel just as good or better than being happy; and the fact that i am still here after struggling with depression for so many years is proof of my strength i wish you the best in your journey,0
vistaril is antihistamine and non-habit-forming so to me its worth a try in the past it helped some of my anxiety but currently im on gabapentin which is doing a better job for me but that is a daily medication,1
every antidepressant theyve ever put me on spun me into a horrible manic rapid cycling hell,0
talk therapy dbt life balance classes all of these are great the more you understand your disorders the better also remember youre not alone here this group also has been a great help to me talking with people with the same disorders and knowing how they manage it dont expect medication (if prescribed) to work right away sometimes it doesnt work and another would have to be tried everybody is different so medications would be trial and error until a combo work perfectly for you i myself am currently on celexa but it only helps me with the anxiety not the depression im supposed to be taking a mood stabilizer but i cannot afford it right now without a job again remember youre not alone in this,1
i had this for my anxiety got taken off it due to pregnancy gone from fairly functioning human being to not being able to leave the house most days  i have agoraphobia without it panic attacks at the thought of being around people i cant sleep properly without it as my anxiety keeps me awake pregabalin honestly changed my life,1
there are websites to help you find ways to talk to your kids when my daughter was 7 and my son was 11 i say down and explained the same thing to them children within this age range are very inquisitive and perceptive they understand a lot more now as their way of thinking is more logical and reflective you should start off by talking about mental illness in general explain that just like a person can get physically sick their mind can get sick too you can then explain what bpd is and how it affects you for example you could explain “borderline personality disorder is a mental illness that makes the parts of your mind responsible for emotions sick it stops you from being able to control your emotions which is why i am sometimes very angry sad frustrated or annoyed over little things that people normally feel just a tiny bit angry sad frustrated or annoyed over how i feel is no ones fault and i will get better so don’t worry” your child may feel the need to help you feel better let them know it is not their responsibility and that there are special doctors who will help you recover from this illness but you could also suggest a drawing from your child will make you feel good so they don’t feel so helpless,0
i can relate i am currently having the problem of restlessness and needing to move but i also dont feel like moving if you need to talk im here,0
im not afraid to die im afraid of leaving my 4 babies behind,0
will be your hero tomorrow as well my baby boy feels what i feel then i feel so guilty then i assure him that mums okay and he can go back being a dog my baby is oscaryour babys name is?,0
i had been on the same meds for 10-15 yrs so i told the dr my anxiety was getting worse i have so many med allergies or bad reactions i get scared to try other meds but i went through about 4 months a trying different meds ending up in these classes b/c nothing would work or i was allergic i have been put back on the original med of zoloft with with sequel the sequel has helped the panic but the depression is off the chain the dr said my fight/flight switch has been turned on and my brain dont let it turn off my house here has so much mold growing and my husband wont fix it so i feel i am not keeping my youngest daughter safe and i need to get out of this house which means i feel this huge pressure to work and then i get my mind all worked up into a really bad state,1
ummmmm suicide is never ever okay got it it just isnt i know that answer sucks i feel that i want desperately for a different answer myself but here is the problem even if you/ i dont think anyone else will be hurt affected or worse off because of our suicide they will be we cannot hurt others by our actions it isnt fair of us to burden others with our pain i understand the pain is awful we want/need to get away but we cannot make others suffer the way we do,0
hallucinations are a tough on i hear voices all the time which i know arent real and that i should ignore im on olanzapine to help with that as for anger have you tried mindfulness? its used for anxiety but it helps me to focus and breathe and for anger or anxiety to pass it might be with checking out the web and there are apps for your phone be careful hallucinations and anger can be a sign of mania keep in regular contact with your therapist and see if you can get into your dr sooner keep a journal of your moods feelings etc it will help when you take it to your appointments take care,1
tristen does have bipolar but i do not feel the need to share all the details with anyone the only thing im gonna say is she was the youngest child ever diagnosed with it by a psychiatrist at scott & white mental health tristen also has a slight learning disorder so she does get confused about things we did not wait a year for labs or meds to be given,1
i will always just survive day to day being around others and doing pretty much anything is sometimes an overwhelming effort i have to work a very simple job as i have avoid all stress as its a serious trigger i dont drive or have any skills due to all my effort being taken up with battling depression and anxiety for the past 20 years i take no pleasure in life and most if the time just want everything to end,1
this more than applies to my everyday struggles but i keep fighting it thank you to all who understand,0
what anti anxiety do you take? ive also been having a lot of trouble waking up to alarms lately out of nowhere,1
to not be so damn busy all the time! lol just want a few days of guilt free rest where i dont feel like i have to be doing something!,0
been like this for six months cost me a marriage i wish ppl would know how hard anxiety and depression cam be,1
i use lavender candles bubble bath carpet deodorizer everything and it creates a calmer environment sometimes and help calm me i read somewhere that lavender helps with anxiety and helps calm your brain down and so far ive had a lot of success with it,1
so sorry to hear of your loss joy sincerly my condonlences to you and his wife yes im mighty angry at the fact the pathetic mental health system is just crap they should be ashamed of themselfs to the max they all need to pull there fingers out and start helping instead of hindering the system is a shambles i myself have bi polar and is a struggle and a rollercoaster ride but yes more needs to be done straight away for many suffers and again joy im sorry for your loss *,0
seroquel is killer!! 3 years ago i was put on a high dose of seroquel i gained over 100 pounds in one year i didnt know what was happening i was super confused finally my dr took me off of it stating that i had gained too much weight and that "seroquel tends to do that" i was furious he waited for me to gain over a hundred pounds before telling me unfortunately seroquel is one of the few meds that i feel actually do something for me so since then lithium was added to my med mix and back on a low dose of seroquel needless to say i have been unable to shed the weight and feel like im a pound heavier every time i go to dr the gain in weight is whats triggering the blood sugar problems ive also been on highest dose of gabapentin for a long time now and dont feel that it is a contributing factor to my weight gain,0
tried it became very irritable and angry worse than i already was my psychiatrist said that zoloft is not recommended for people who are bipolar,0
yes because what happened becomes amplified in my sleep so what was already hell turns into horror,1
i have these symptoms but have never been diagnosed with bpd i do take regular medication for anxiety though should i be looking to be diagnosed and if so do i need medication?,1
perhaps never which is one of the reasons i refuse to do itafraid of the legacy,0
cant stress enough go doctors get referal with expert advice take meds good luck it takes time but dont give up you are not alone,1
long answer: bipolar disease is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain it can be treated with medication and therapy typically people with bipolar disease have learned to compensate for it in unhealthy ways (illegal drug use eating disorders gambling promiscuity alcoholism self harm etc) and therapy can assist them with overcoming these unhealthy "coping mechanisms" in addition they may need therapy that assists with rebuilding family relationships that the sufferer (while in a relapse state) has damaged bipolar disease often causes lability of emotional response and potentially self-damaging behaviors that come from that they tend to have periods of mania/hypomania and depression that is severe during mania they may feel like they have more energy be happier (without reason) have grandiose ideas of themself and their abilities need less sleep be much more sexual and engage in risky behaviors without considering the consequences during depression they may be suicidal incapable of caring for themself engage in self-harm have a hard time leaving their house/bed and miss a lot of work depending on what "type" of bipolar a person has (or where they fall on the spectrum) determines quite often how serious their periods of mania/hypomania are and how long those occurand how serious their depressive episodes are and how long those occur regardless its a difficult situation they live with constantly medication typically works to counterbalance the chemical imbalance in their brain (or offset the symptoms) so that they can function somewhat normally without huge highs and lows,1
i am on 400mg lithium 500mg navalparo in morning and at night 550mg navalparo 450mg lithium and 650mg quetiapine and tranquipam 5mg - i hate lithuim when i started with it i suffered hairloss nausea runny nose and shaking its better now because they test my blood regularly and i gained 30 pounds i cant get rid of,1
except the night terrors,0
i am going through the same thing as p x but i still dont know how to come to terms with me having a mental illness i am seeing a counsler and a psychologist and on meds but still cant shake the feeling of being alone i have a wife and kids but things with wife arent going good between us im just feeling lost,0
i think its safer keeping those thoughts to ourselves to prevent getting locked up you can take that either way legal or mental id rather open up anonymously i dont want people knowing everything that goes on inside my head hell sometimes it scares me,0
no but i have seriously thought about having it i dont know maybe desperation have discussed it with the psychiatrist off and ondo not know,0
i have anxiety with the public so i got a warehouse job and have been alot better,1
i take various meds of different type i dont view the world of my brain as having one end all and be all my meds that i am on now were not fixing everything i had too many hormonal shifts that were also causing huge bipolar mood swings i couldnt find an oral contraceptive or medication that helped so i switched to doing medical herbs to help control the hormonal shifts i am on 4 different types of actual psychiatric meds as a cocktail and they are realtively low doses i also take xanax if needed i do yoga exercise essential oil therapy have my service dog and do various other things for coping mechanisms honestly when my meds are off i have still found my stability is far better because of all the other things i include in my regime and it often helps me from getting too bad i also dont try to stop certain types of obsessive thoughts and instead direct my obsession onto productive projects i have,1
i set an alarm on my phone,0
i couldnt keep it down i would take it and then 5-10 minutes later vomit it was miserable,1
this is such a great graphic shows how many of us with mental illness struggle,0
i am going through the same thing my partner doesnt believe that depression anxiety and bp "exist" and that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance of the brain cannot argue with the man because he wont budge on his opinion so annoying to deal with,1
propanalol is a beta blocker you can be anxious yet your heart rate will not increase i found it effective with no side effects,1
im the same way  it was so bad that i paid some one to stay the day with me if my husband or kid couldnt come over  my husband has been working from home now just so i dont freak out  i feel the safest in the er too been there so many time cause i thought i was having a heart attach or i was going to die i have seen 3 phycologist 2 physiatrist and was told i suffer from a form of ptsd  was put on meds and i use meditation for anxiety to go to sleep too  i found the meditation on u tube really helps and a phycologist that deal with hypnotherapy  when i suffer panic attack even if someone is around me i do gardening or anything to keep my thought busy which is hard when your in an attack you will be told to accept the attacks let them pass  they cant kill you just take a deep breath count to 4  release the air count to 4 slow your breathing down  tell your self that this too shell pass hope that helps a bit  if only there was an easier way to deal with this,0
i feel that well more or less he doesnt understand it like yesterday i started crying and it makes him feel helpless because he couldnt help me which makes him feel inadequate,0
i have mild anxiety and ocd but my sex drive has never really been affected by it i have taken citalopram sertraline and anafranil in my life but did not take sertraline for long as i did not get on with it made me feel sick alot and itchy with rashes,1
they are both equally as important; significant weight gain is bad for the heart in the long run! i have severe ra ( rheumatoid arthiritis as well as bipolar disorderra markedly increaes your risk of cardio vascular disease through various variables probably the inflammatory nature of the disease is the biggest risk! bipolar in some studies has also shown a correlation with heart diseaseeither through the illness itself the meds or bothi reckon both but it may be heavily linked to the drugs that cause rapid & marked weight gainand associated type 2 diabetes along with metabolic syndrome this is not an option for me given the fact i find it hard to push to do basic exercises never mind the intense exercise that would be needed to combat and mitigate these effects! therefore if this drug does indeed work for me once i am stabilised i will neverheless be requesting a slow taper off of it and then switch to another med if neededone that has much less risk of unatural weight gain and metaboluc disturbances given the very real risk potential of my physical illness! this is just my personal view on this drug; it is certainly not meant to scare or be a deciding factor for anyone else! people should be able to research it for themselves and if they are then ok to go ahead with it they are then in the best place to make an individual decision based on their own experience of side effect/efficiency balance yet another reason that this drug may not be suitable for me in the long term is that it can raise the hormone prolactin which given the fact i have had bouts of pcos in the past is not a good thing! kind wishes to all; sometimes its such a difficult and complicated road we have to travel living with this illness♡¤♡,1
you talk far more sense than some others on here they all talk about betrayal and him having an affair!!! not one person has even considered what he was going through at the time its not only the person suffering from depression and anxiety that is suffering but also the partner hence the separation at the end of the day he was going through a bad time too did a stupid thing n it unfortunately resulted in a pregnancy if you cant get past that n support each other through this then it wont work the other lady didnt ask for all this so just try hard to make it work together n not to fight,0
most if not all of these are symptoms of other disorders or even things that people with neurotypical brains experience you only need medication for something if it will improve your quality of life if you have concerns that your current medication/diagnosis doesnt cover talk to your doctor about them they can make a determination about another diagnosis/changing your medication/what have you otherwise dont worry yourself by assuming you have a completely different disorder when you might not fit the criteria at all,1
so sorry to hear how bad you feel acute mood swings are really scary and lead to confusion and fear apart from counselling have you thought of consulting a neurologist? just a thought!,0
im watching it right now half way true i do notice that it triggers my depression (i have bordeline and alot of trust issues with men which plays a big part in the show due to being sexualized / rape etc ) so i watch it in my own pass and take days in between episode so its not overwhelming,0
for several months l have battled the onslaught of complex post tramatic stress disorder (comlpex as trauma has been a reoccurring theme throughout my life i strongly identify with what you have to face day in day outl am a believer in compliance with meds however double locking doors and closed shutters seemed to just exaserbate the fear of the feari suggest you talk to your dr about having "graded exposure"therapyl am pleased to say its working for me and has opened up a different way of life l can literally smell the roses and feel hope!,0
i have been on seroquel for about 4 years- it definitely causes a lot of sedation- have no idea how people take it during the day and weight gain is a likely side effect as well i was up to 350 and then decreased to 200 and it was the most uncomfortable process i have ever been through severe body aches sweating nausea and an out of control mood so just take the minimum that will control your symptoms as getting the dose down will be hard,1
i think its a very hard thing to hear but its the truth  im not bipolar but i do struggle with intense depression and anxiety  i struggle daily with suicidal thoughts and wanting to cut myself  but at least a professional is telling u its normal instead of making you seem crasy like everyone makes me feel insane or dramatic i would love to find someone who will take me seriously and understand my pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow im very very suicidal but no one makes me feel ok about it,0
i take lamictal safris oraly  invega and abilify shots for bipolar one and clonopin and seroquel for anxiety its a big cocktail but its totally worth it my bipolar simptoms r under control for the meantime ,1
if i dont express my feelings get them out i explode! i have never wallowed! i have shoved away and pretended that its all ok thats not learning anything so your statement is kinda hurtful and condescending (i suffer from bipolar severe depression social anexity fear of abandonment and lots more) js,1
i use mindfulness techniques sorry for my english i m italian i use "zen"meditation defusions techniques that is trying to separate from thoghts in many ways you can say to yourself" its just a thought i dont have to do anything with it"; repeat the thought in different ways slow very very slow fast very fast with other voices as imitating people until the thought become a "thing" as another insignificant thing you see on a table if you start breathing as u do in meditation or yoga than you can imagine to be on the grass looking to the sky and every thought is a cloud and you put it on a cloud and you see it go away or always breathing imagine to be on a bridge and under you  you see some trains and those trains have their wagons you put your thoughts on the trains like this: train of thoughts on the left train of emotions number 2 train of sensations (about body)number 3and you note what is passing in your mind and you take the thought the emotiin or sensation and put it on the right wagon that is moving under your bridge dont worry if you find on the train that is you believe your thought is so true and strong and you are rapt from it and u follow it without putting an end as you notice this thing you gentle say to yourself :oh i was on the train oroh thank you miss mind or sir thought to rimind me to exist but now i start back breathing mindfully and come back on my bridge and you on your train and i say you goodbye i ts hard and it needs a lot of practice but it works zen meditation helped me a lot but i need to be followed by some people who practice it because alone its hard with a mental illness,0
my anxiety has been driving me crazy!!!!!!!!! going on 2 weeks because the dr cut down on my meds i ran out already & my mind is racing 150 miles per minute!!!!!!! i feel horrible i think i should go to the er room ,0

i can relate to you with the weight gain and meds im currently reducing mine i understand if no one else does that putting weight on effects your mental state aswel and diets do exist and so does exercise but until ppl realise that some meds make it so no matter what you do it doesnt work i also understand about living is harder i have suffered something similar and for that i saw a councillor and worked through it it doesnt happen overnight but you can get through it with determination that its not going to takeover your life mindfulness if you do it properly does work for trauma i feel your pain and know how hard life can be but you can work through it and succeed in your life your 19 and have been through hell but take control and you win not them i know you can do it just take one day at a time and you will be able to have a life it never goes away but you can deal with it the things you have been through do not define you as a person its going to be hard and your going to have to deal with feelings that are overwhelming but believe me i can talk about it without feeling anything now because i have taken control and so can you i hope this has helped take care and remember one day at a time xx,0

after two years im certain he has went through your mood swings and anxiety with you he may already know and respectfully does not bring it up communication honesty and trust are the keys to building and maintaining such a relationship,0
thanks sue i dont like to see guys treating people in an adverse way it gets us all tarred with same brush her guy has issues but she is not the cause if anything he is the cause of her anxiety   i hope she gets support via this group who will put her in the right direction of realising her true worth once she accepts how important she is she will be able to then choose who she shares her life with and not feel she has to stay with a manipulative jerk because he has made her lose her own identity to support his    ,1
stay strong folks and do not be afraid to get help its the label mental illness that scares people sending out caring thoughts and love to any one that needs it ,0

just remember they are here to help and they are not judging you it isnt a test  they usually help you to learn how to manage it and it can be very useful opening up to a stranger i had cbt and for me it did wonders !! :) hope all goes well x i suggest taking some rescue remedy (can be found in most pharmacies) it really helps me settle my anxiety hope this helps x,1
i didnt take any meds while pregnant its 100% safer no worries about birth defects or anything for my babies,1
i have borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder and freaking generalized anxiety disorder phew never said all that out loud to anyone but doctors its exhausting but you can be ok theres no magic pill (i waited for a long time) and you have to force yourself to think differently (im not to good at that yet) but theres other people who are like you and theres people who will listen and care i cried my entire first visit to a therapist but you need it trust me :) its scary but worth it,1
courtney jaye the struggle,0

living with bipolaranxiety and panic attacks,1
go to your doctor with someone who cares for you going alone is scary i know ive been there,0
do you take meds? and yes certian people take all my energy i avoid that a all cost but i live a lone so it is easy but i would get anxiety and depression the longer i had to be around them so like groups drain my energy to ask you doctor or therapist about help for it if you have to live with them try to build your owen space expain why you need it in a medical mannor,1
i have a day of the week dispenser i carry with me that way if i am unsure if i have taken them or not i can just check that particular days section i fill it up straight away every wednesday after i have taken that days meds also the reminders on here help :-) x,1
between those two pictures is how i discribe anxiety or what anxiety is like for me,1
yea i guess it stems from paranoia and anxiety thats how i feel with myself im very suscpious of everyone around me for some odd reason,0
it swindled me in was in the house for almost 3 months straight i finally decided to fight back and take my kids out for a day of fun and ended up with a fractured elbow between the depression and anxiety ive been dealing with it took about a week to convince myself i could handle one day my kids had a blast so i guess it was worth it its been a bit tougher now that im dealing with so much pain and an itch that i cant scratch due to this cast ughhh i sometimes wish i could have an out of my body and mind experience just to be normal for a day and be able to cope with things like others do,0
they do not want to understand and could careless there is no compassion to the one that is suffering from it panic disorder with agoraphobia had what it seems like forever i been told i fake it to get attention or meds to feel good on so far from the truth,0
i feel like lithium gave me my life i cant even say it gave me my life "back" because for as long as i can remember internally i was out of control and cycled between deep depressions to hypomanic irritable episodes every couple of weeks i didnt want to die but i did not want to live either i am not saying you cant live unmedicated but your reasoning should be balanced against what type of quality of life you have medicated vs unmedicated best of luck,0
never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game,0
a lot of anxiety,1
latuda gave me horrible sides different for everyone was the worst for me of all meds ive tried,1
truebut we cant feel others peoples pain or do anything about itso maybe selfishly its about me and i shouldnt feel guilty,0
thanks for sharing ive tried to over dose 3 times each time i felt so alone and it would never feel better praise god it did but it took changing meds support from friends and family and some time to let it happen im stable today and i have been for about 9 months im a little stressed now because we are changing a med because of weight gain i pray it works god bless you your doing great!!!,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar when i was 17 and im 28 now and what you have described it sounds like me it isnt bipolar it sounds like borderline personality disorder or unstable personality disorder turns out i was wrongly diagnosed at 17 so for 11 years i thought it was bipolar turns out its bpd the difference between the two is bipolar the manic moods and extreme lows happen over weeks months where what i have got happens hours or minutes one minute happy laughing then upset and angry like really angry within a few hours im back happy again hope this has helped,1
it can lead to risky behavior especially in severe cases think black snake moan type behavior in a committed relationship it can be fun to enjoy though,0
im there to and i only work sat and sunday 12 hour shifts but get sick to my stomach and anxious i thought about quitting n hiding to at times,0
i no exactly how u feel im 26 with 2 children i have managed without medication for my mental health for a good many years as a mum i didnt want to feel like zombie at the moment im struggling so much and its effecting my kids so now im having to look back at medication im about to start a new antisycotic which im hoping will help and not make me to sleepy its such a hard balance maybe u just need something for now like im doing till u can get urself back on track i see medication as a support but not a cure ill be on them till i feel i can manage again ur not failing by taking something we all need to do whats best for our families talk with ur partner be honest my husbands been my rock if u really dont want meds there are a lot of talking therapies and other treatment im doing 1 soon to help with emotional control so talk to ur gp see whats available excersise is really good it helps clear the mind never be afraid to ask for help its the bravest thing u can do i hope u find something that helps u wishing u all the best xx,0
when i was first diagnosed as bipolar my mom kept saying that i wasnt she didnt believe the dr but in the same breath eod say that she thought that the (bipolar) meds were helping i think that there is so much stigma on mental health issues that still clouds the truth today i used to explain my depression before the bipolar like cancer i can treat it and it can go into remission but its never really gone and i didnt do anything wrong to get it its a sickness just like getting cancer it can be hereditary things can happen in life that can make you more vulnerable to it but you cant speak it into or out of existence,0
my brothers 30 and has autism theres no pill for that my darling and no cure just therapy bro and i have lived together our whole lives i know all about it yet i can only speak of what its like to live with an autistic person i cant speak of what its like to have it although 30 yearsive come to know my brother very well anyway with everything else you mentioned a good doctor and medication can make you feel better but not fixed im afraid :-) i have severe depression severe anxiety panic disorder borderline personality disorder avoidant personality disorder type 2 bipolar rls cerebral palsy and im half deaf im a beauty i tell ya lol theres always help id love bro to go to therapy but its hard to explain my brother he wont go,0
im lucky i live in the uk we have the nhs which we pay for through our taxes we dont have to pay to see doctors or for hospital treatment we do have a charge for prescriptions for people that work the unemployed and very low income earners get them free although we pay a fee it is still cheaper than paying privately our government is planning on privatising our nhs so that will mean well have to get health insurance and things will probably be the same for us as yourselves this really frightens me i bet the insurance for bipolar patients will be sky high i feel for you it must be terrible not to be able to afford the treatment you need i am so lucky at the moment hope you can get the help that you need soon we need our medication it makes life almost bearable good luck ❤️,1
there might be other solutions that can help heal us without the harsh modern drugs ,1
just remember everyone is different they gave it to my adult son for anxiety and for some nerve damage he had it helped no side effects and didnt have a hard time getting off of it unfortunately it is trial by fire for all drugs but it is also a process of elimination too god speed,1
but i never feel happy i live in brokenhome so i get confused with "i want to be happy again" or "i want to be the old me",0
often the people around me have no clue unless my hands get shaky or i am pacing and talking fast at that point they assume i am high on something me being me i let them assume what they may getting pulled over is no fun though these things are misinterpreted as being high or having something to hide well yea im hiding my anxiety as best as i can for my shakiness? i take a benzo this helps to merely slow the physical parts but not the mind as much for the mind i am learning to be more aware of the trigger and not respond so quick to it,1
suicide ideation and intrusive thoughts which is what you are describing are not a reason to be committed to hospital but you should explain them to your therapist as they can be extremely unsettling especially when they are so vivid or wont go away which is very distressing and not under your control they are a symptom of how you are feeling and im sure talking about them will give you some relief,0
i was on 25 mgs for about three weeks and we quit it i had an almost six week withdrawal from it its still going on im very spaced out i keep having awful panic attacks and i cant concentrate on anything i also keep getting extremely confused its awful i hate it,0
death is our only transport to meet the creator no one is immune to it being thankful and having gratitude lessens the anxiety about it you can be thankful even for the smallest things like commenting hereothers are blind some are fingerless some dont have phones etc in everything we need to be thankful appreciation goes a long way even if our family members sometimes think we are acting out but love covers a multitude of sins i really love your comment,0
effexor was the worst for me ive been taking different ones for almost 10 years and i gained so much weight side effects were horrible my vision got bad my memory im on celexa now,0
i would try to wait to take the xanax until the morning or until a trigger is beginning its onset is usually 15-20minutes and is used in panic attacks more so as they have a shorter duration (4-6hrs) then many of the other benzos (12+hrs),1
wellbutrin is well known for increasing anxiety if you have it already it didnt work well for me at all but everyone us different,1
life is precious marlene  i have a gratitude journal which i fill on my worse days  helps to break me out of darkness  i suffer from both anxiety  depression and extreme lonliness on my worse days ,1
i am sorry you feel shame your feelings are perfectly normal for someone in your situation,0
right people think i dont want to change or get a better paying job its my brain telling me i cant if that makes any sense i want to so bad but scared of everything  im not normal,0
yescall a hospital because he is a vulnerable adult he is mentally incapable to make such a risky plan he also needs to get his his violent temper under control before he really hurts themor maybe even kills them i know he is your brother and you love him but only tough love will help him call hospital!,0
i havent gotten diagnosed with bpd but ive been diagnosed with major chronic depression and generalized anxiety disorderbut the older i get the more ive started to notice i have symptoms of bpd and some of my friends who do have bpd believe that i do im terrified to go back to a doctor because people already look at me weird for my depression and anxiety i dont know what to doand i feel as if its getting worse,1
this is our new normal float out in good time remember when you are down you can only remember the bad things when you are up and normal you only remember the normal times try not to get into manias look into peoples eyes and if they are looking horrified at your grandiose pressured speech give them some space seroquel is good to prevent manias cut your credit cards up to prevent spending sprees in manias and sort your money out that the rent and all costs are automatically paid each week with what is left over being accessible to spend,0
i use a pill box and also set an alarm on my phone,1
those are considered to have many blurred lines multiple therapists and psychiatrist have said i have both with psychotic tendencies on many occasions i quit going cuz i became even more confused,0
i noticed after journaling that food effects my moods carbs but esp sugars give me severe mood swings and make me very irritable and blah i do clean eating w daily (least 5 days a week in gym) its amazing what a difference i feel! of course there are still bad days but overall im very stable its just very hard to stay disciplined and without consistantly and not eat dessert butits been working for going on 2 years now,0
poor anties shame,0
ive found bath& body works stress relief helps it comes in bath and lotion form ingredients are spearmint and eucalyptus,1
i saw my therapist todaywho works closely with my doctor she said i look dreadful and was in tears from pain throughout most of our session she has got the nurses to book me for a doctors visit on friday to see whats up the nurses agree that 5 days with increasingly worse stomach pains cramps nausea etc is not worth it something is definitely wrong they are worried about my kidneys at this stage especially since i am already a high risk patient with decreased liver function so its just to wait it out till friday morning thanks all for your support and help this community is amazing,1
going through tapering now for 3rd time feeling like you descibed beth oneill  im glad i read what you said as its making me feel less worried about it not being normal i couldnt remember what the tapering was like before as it was aweful but i was really unwell mentally too at the time thank you,0
ive been in your situation beforeit is horrible! this is legit try goodrxcom or they have an appyou can get huge discounts on your meds! i had to use it a few times especially for my effexor i could go without the others but damn i felt like i was dying without the effexor ended up i only had to pay $12 out of pocket for my script! its worth a shot you can enter your meds and then it gives you pricing at your local pharmaciesyou just go in show them your phone with your "card/member" number that goodrx gives you and you get the meds for that price!,0
same thing happened to me 2 weeks into taking this med i was having horrible hallucinations at night and weird dreams then shortly after i developed a full body rash i didnt know the rash was connected to the medication at first and was misdiagnosed at the first urgent care visit as just having a basic rash later found out i was allergic to the medication and spent a week in the hospital with liver failure my enzyme levels were in the 500s,1
i hope youre in therapy for bpd i know someone very close to me who has this diagnosis and its absolutely awful for them without their therapy with their therapy theyre doing a lot better and theyre happier generally theyre using dbt dbt has some positive results for people with bpd if you are in therapy for it already it may take some time before you see good results just dont give up on itor on yourself! you said you push everyone away but that youre extremely lonely have you tried being honest with the people in your life? tell them your diagnosis and what that meansand that you do want them in your life you need them but youre afraid of being betrayed hurt let down abandoned or whatever other issue you may be feeling? im willing to bet that some of them would try to understand and be more likely to help you with your concerns people who care for you and love you will try to be there for you you just have to let them my best wishes are with you please dont give up,0
lol the thing is im not thats how i cope with my anxiety if something is causing me anxiety ive trained myself to not even bother thinking about it because the moment i do? anxiety creeps back in everyone has different coping methods,1
i hate the term(just shy)and a lot of people with mental illness have drug problems from self medicating years before they seek helpi dont like this doctori hope he doesnt discourage you from future helpgood for you for tryinggod bless,1
anxiety can cause your throat to feel like its closing also go to the dr just in case it happens to me but im not on any medication,1
it is a struggle but please remember your not alone  my son described it to his mates like i wake up tigger or eeyore ever need to talk pm me,0
the only time i feel like sex is when im manic otherwise i have no sex drive the depression and anxiety destroy it although you try to make it happen it just doesnt it doesnt mean he doesnt love you or not find you attractive its the illness it must be difficult for you it will be for him too but in a different way hope his health improves soon x,0
your partner is insensitive and causes you more stress than needed  i was in some unhealthy 6year shit i fuckin dipped no your worth,1
celexa was horrid horrid horrid for me and gabapentin was useless,0
my best mate is on abilify and he seems to be ok in the energy department; i mean he was probably tired for a while when they started him on it but currently he doesnt seem to have any energy issues related to medication (his schizophrenia and anxiety causes tiredness but his levels of tiredness are the same as prior to abilify),1
i had pip on my mental status and was totally embarrassedyou have to portray yourself on your worse daythey come to check every part of the form you filled in x,0
hurtful questionn alot of insensitive comments its not like we can help it so on top of hereditary mental health issuesi have to be forever single? that works wonders on depression n anxiety thanks :(,1
after my visit to docs today to be told " ive been seeing that docs place for 2 yrs and should be normal now and taking my meds not trying to lessen or zero my meds and still have anxiety days" i felt like telling him my anxiety has been with me for over 2 decades and have always done what everyone wanted me to do to get better not what i needed to do to get better and in the last year or two i have had improvements and what the hell is normal im different not broken im me i would rather be interactive with my mental health plannot complacent and just take what im told,0
thanks at first i thought im already crazy but knowing other people out there are experiencing the same struggles calmed me down if there are people who had overcome it i know i can too someday,0
everyday people will use my insecurities to their advantage,1
i had the exact same anxiety and i was so happy once i made the decision to go see someone youll be happy you did also get a journal or at least a piece of paper and try to write down whatever youre feeling/going through and what aspects of your life are factors in your mental health trying to remember everything when you know you only have 30 minutes or an hour or whatever sometimes makes me feel pressured,0
i have depression and anxiety and i have most of these symptoms ,1
totally get it depression and anxiety have always been constants in my young adult life i had a mental breakdown back in december and i have been out of work ever since it wasnt until january that i was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder the mere thought of going back to where i worked brings on a panic attack i constantly obsessed over what my coworkers thought of and were saying about me behind my back i always worry about being good enough suicidal thoughts plague my life and i have been hospitalized once for them there are times where i just want to wave the proverbial white flag and not wake up i have a really difficult compartmentalizing and dealing with stressors both positive and negative sometimes i get so overwhelmed that all i can do is cry endlessly most days i feel like a failure and a burden im only 27 and i am currently looking into disability options,0
it really all makes perfect since if you think about it now thats reason to be paranoid,0
upon his observations falret noticed that anxiety is a part of rapid cycling moods and bipolar disorder as is source touched with fire by k r jamison,1
forget :( this anxiety in the morning its hell :(:(,0
i had rapid cycling bipolar the swings are unbelievable just one straight after the other my depression never lasted long or never happened at all because i was straight back up there i appeared to drop from full blown mania to hyper mania then back up again i was put on olanzapine lithium and an anti depressant cant remember which one ive been on that many these meds sent me totally the other way i was a zombie anxiety and depression really bad just could not lift my depression at all and the anxiety was so bad i wanted to die any way after trying lots of different types of mood stabilisers and anti depressants i have now found what suits me i too am on lamotragine also risperidone and my antidepressants is venlofaxine i feel better than i ever have i still have bouts be just mild it took a long time to get there and i thought i never would keep taking the lamotragine and hopefully it will be your saviour too good luck x,1
oh please like one can meditate quietly when your mind is racing one minute and shut off the next this person is is in turmoil right now and it seems like he/she is alone in the chaos of their mind meditation? sorry but this isnt a solution for a person in this current state just saying,0
reach out only if sincere our paranoia lets us see through bullshit,0
i took it for i think it was a month and it would turn me into a self harming/suicidal zombie it was horrible,0
this is going to sound harsh and me myself find it hard to deal with but we have something very not accepted wrong with us we dont deal well with things we seldom stay on our meds & really do they ever really work i think we all need to start trying to harden up why do we need the world to love us why do we think everyone doesnt like us i read the posts every day and we seem so lost and so needy why cant we just learn to live and let everyone else worry if they are good enough for us im truly sick of feeling like a victim or being victimized lets face it weve done some fd up stuff please lets all of us take a deep breath and appreciate that we can live just live xxx,0
i take citalopram 40 mg no problems with driving i find it helpful if you have something to drink with you just in case a panic attack startsit works for me anyways,1
okay but therapy is something that the person with anxiety is willing to partake in there is consent to being gently forced into the situation that causes anxiety there is no consent in a friend or family member forcing you to do the thing despite you saying no and giving a valid reason of it screwing with anxiety,1
just written about this this does not mean all people struggling with mental illness have addiction issues the point to take from this is people who have substance addiction are usually struggling from their own mental illness most people addicted to substances are struggling with their own emotional battle and they should not be stigmatised for it,0
yep welbutrin was an anxiety producer for me too ive been thru so many med changes and trials it would make your head spin (or mine lol) hang in there with the med changes until they find the right ones for you im on clonazepam at night seems to keep the anxiety away and i sleep pretty well (at least better than before) also soft music/meditation can be so helpful,1
i was an rn and had to retire 7 years ago my mental health was affecting my job and i was not risking med errors etc our jobs do not define us xxx,1
thank you meds were changed last thursday & i now have to take one mid day & im afraid i wont remember,1
sorry my comment included a few errors it only helped alleviate my symptoms for approximately one month not week i would not recommend it there is a newer similar therapy that is supposedly similar it is tmcs which stands for trans magnetic cranial stimulation im unsure regarding its availability and whether or not insurance covers it,0
im in a similar situation im currently on a doctor requested loa for my bipolar/depression/anxiety because i (as i would like to call it) fell down the rabbit hole ive been in a rut since december if i had to back track my moods i would say that most of my days would of been black or red anyways im in an iop and im more than sure when i return from my loa ill be terminated because ive taken so many dys off that im negative unpaid sick hours (they give you 20hrs every quarter and since i was denied my last loa (which previously set me back to -72) i am now -150 ish hours i have nothing to cover them,0
yep! its worse when im stressed out :/,0
i guess the questions im asking are whether you ve had the opportunity to actually explain how you feel in full to your husband and then to your children in a way they can understand? that is probably the most simplistic and best case scenario to increase understanding for all if your family know more could they be more understanding? but of course i completely understand its not always as simple as that there may be many reasons why you cant or are unable to explain why you act or feel as you do you may not completely understand yourself with mental illness it can take a long time until you really get to grips with the symptoms thoughts and feelings for you to understand it let alone anyone else it can also be that sufferers feel ashamed a failure or weak in some way that they cant cope or spend all day in bed or cant get better these are very natural feelings but its not a sign of weakness its a sign of strength when you can admit something is wrong mental illness isnt something to be ashamed of our brains are the most complex organ so like other parts of our bodies sometimes they dont work correctly and definitely not a failure we are all different and we shouldnt beat ourselves up or be unkind to ourselves some people dont really want to deal with it mental illness isnt easy for loved ones to deal with do you have any other support? with recovery this involves many things i wonder if there are other things which might help you being a mother is very hard very demanding we might look at others and think they are doing so well and we compare ourselves and cant understand why we act like we do but with a mental health problem its hard enough coping with our own issues is there anyone who could help with the children? lots of questions but just looking at possible options take good care x,0
if you start lactating dont be alarmed risperdol does that,1
i also have bipolar depression and anxiety i think the best assistance you can provide yourself is to see another professional as you age your diagnosis can change as you as a person have changed regardless seek some help medication will help you level out emotionally and take stock in what needs to be done,1
is she going to wean you off? simply not renewing can be very dangerous potential side effects of cold turkey are seizures hallucinations and psychotic episodes lesser side effects can be anxiety dizziness increased heart rate and headaches if your doctor is forcing you to quit cold turkey get in to a different psychiatrist immediately,1
i suggest looking up mindfulness its a technique therapists use for anxiety and im sure it would be helpful in your situation when i start to feel uneasy about s situation i pull out some play doh and get my mindfulness head on i focus on the play doh and smell it feel it squish it rub it against my cheek etc its about focusing on something else ive even done it with a tissue a really simple version but a bit more invasive is colouring again a way to really empty the mind and focus on 1 specific thing there are lots of resources on the net and even apps for your phone all the best,0
yeah id never had anxiety before i tried wellbutrin i know all drugs work differently for people and its probably a miracle drug for some but that was the worst drug reaction i ever had and it was scary and awful,0
in 2014 a dr prescribed those to me and although i already shake bc of my anxiety those made my shaking worse it was embarrassing i saw a psychiatrist a few months later and he told me that the dr shouldnt have precribed me those two together he put me on effexor klonopin and trazadone and my shaking almost stopped good luck hope you can find something better,1
i use purata and it really helps i drink a 15 mg an hour before i go anywhere where i might have an anxiety attack and use a 30 mg at night,1
yup we make up being depressed fearful manic so much fun! we love messing with people starting fights being told its all in our heads im sorry if a doc diagnosed us then they arent the ones that are wrong but our family and friends that treat us like liars are,0
fortunately i wasnt on meds when i was pregnant i battle my disorders in silence i dont know if i am worth listening to but if you can hold off increasing the meds i think you should i know what your going thru to some degree and its definitely tough i have many disorders including bipolar there are many side affects that affect us let alone a baby i believe the meds could have some affect it would scare me i hope you find peace in whatever you do my prayers are with you god bless!!,1

i have been off my meds since november i know i need to get back on them but i am so afraid of the reaction i have been experiencing to them i am bipolar with ptsd i have been on meds for 32 years at first the meds seem to work great but eventually i start hallucinating losing sleep or cycling thru mania to psychosis i talk to my drs about these issues but usually they just prescribe another med that supposedly treats the side effect i also have severe ra and progressive ms trying to maintain both physical and mental health is overwhelming i know i need to get back on some meds for my mental issues but i am not very hopeful that they will help any advice or new meds that might help?,1
whats new pussycat? 1965 peter sellers peter otoole did not hold well up over time saw it in 07 and shook my head,1
i pushed everyone away and i got pushed out its my fault i know but i never lied to anybody that tried to get close to me physically or mentally they had no idea it was that bad it always looks easy to handle in books but when faced directly on with this issue people get scared they dont know how i will act day to day so they walk on eggshells around me which i never picked up on people dont come near me because i am unpredictable i have never known this till recently i have no way to repair the damage that has been afflicted to the countless peoplei try to fix it but i make it alot worse i have nobody to turn to because i am afraid of damaging them as well,0
i also suffer from panic attacks and anxiety attacks i highly recommend you try cbd oil it did wonders for me and its all natural,1
when i first started it i had a similar reaction as well as getting an upset stomach i started taking it before i went to bed instead of in the morning which helped heaps and it settled down after a couple of weeks been the best medication for me out of all the ones ive tried,1

ok heres my spin diet is a major factor in depression and anxiety this is an awful truth but unless a decent diet is addressed the body is in a constant state of alert either to get rid of toxins parasites or high levels of blood sugar loads of research has been done on the gut brain connection and is well worth the reading doctors are happy to prescribe an instant fix but it never addresses the long term well being of a person just the now i am not selling anything or trying to argue a point with anyone its just this i have personally suffered anxiety and chronic depression on and off all my life i started on a new diet based on no grains and no sugar this grew to include night shades and read meat i eat berries and greek style yogurt for breakfast most days( frozen berries are in supermarkets for cheap) or eggs and salad each day i try to eat one raw meal and one cooked meal if you are at all interested please pm and i will explain furtheri take no medications at all and i have support in 12 step groups and close friends i am so happy to be in control of my dieti have lost weight and gained my self respectawesomemy grocery bill is xlnt i have helped many people to be free of gut problems and hence lead happier lives probiotics are useless if not addressing a diet peace to all who read this jb,1
i also have driving anxiety to the point where i have to pull over and throw up i dont take anything though im on three antidepressants and thats enough,1
i started seeing a naturopathic doctor after my psych basically told me im out of med options im not on any meds but have changed my diet drastically (gluten and dairy free) am taking iron supplements will be adding some homeopathic remedies soon as well as probiotics and protein shakes to fix "leaky gut" and keep my stress as low as possible for now it has worked amazingly! i can definitely tell how my mood changes and how much more susceptible to changing emotions i am when i eat gluten or dairy now that ive gone off it it might not work for everyone and some people can do it while staying on a very low dose of medication (i might have to go back on low dose of lithium once stress increases) but i figured it was certainly worth a shot! my dr tries to treat my whole body im also seeing an acupuncturist who does stuff with my head and gives some chinese medicine advice for it im currently doing more and more research into chinese medicine and reflexology and natural medicine stuff its amazing how deficiencies and poor diet can affect your brain also i was testing for neurotransmitter deficiencies so im waiting to hear the results and then will take a naturapathic approach to correcting them!,1
why are you stuck at home? think of who you have for support and find comfort in them instead of someone whos trying to control you if hes choosing to leave you dont let him visit whenever he feels like it thats not fair to you you dont need stress while growing a baby ♡,0
im on 75 mg twice a day and 20 mg of cexela and im still struggling no side affects though,0

i gained quite a bit of weight on lamictal so im pretty sure its a common problem and yes my face broke out like i was back in puberty struggled for a long time with both but finally found a cleanser that worked for my face its called cetaphil but i dont know if its available in your country as for the weight i cut down on junk food sweets and cold drinks ive lost about 10kg in 6 months speak to your doc though there might be something else you can take,0
seroquel is an anti-psychotic that helps one relax when it comes to anxiety and fight the paranoia of becoming anxious! i myself am diagnosed with bipolar disorder depression ptsd and anxiety getting out of bed everyday is most of the time a struggle i have been on seroquel for 3 years andyes there have been times where we have to either lower my dose or increase it some but it has worked especially for my insomnia it helps me fall asleep stay asleep and most of the time i wake up feeling refreshed and calm! which is so rewarding!!! yes i am 26 years old but i have a daughter who was prescribed the same medication when she was 9 and it was very effective for her also! plus its not addicting and it doesnt cause you to be dependant on it! there are days that i can go to bed without it and i am fine! plus it might help enough to where it can be a short term medication and he will possibly learn and develop a routine to falling asleep and waking up in his own bed! its worth a shot and i hope it helps!!! ps i live in the usa but maybe since you have been informed of this medication and knowing it is safe for kids and teens with little to no side effects it can be discussed with your brothers dr they both need some relief so maybe if he denies it look into another dr who is willing to try to give your brother the help he needs and your mom the peace and rest she and her both need maybe one who sees that this is a problem in which they are willing to try to help fix and correct! good luck and best wishes from the usa,1
i have always struggled with this problem ive been accused of "wearing my heart on my sleeve" or being too emotional or taking things to personal ive even lost jobs over it no one understands what it is like to have all these things rolling around in your head that you cant control (bipolar 1 anxiety bpd ptsd) it may not be the best solution but what i always do was i would pinch my leg or back until i could get to somewhere private and then i would cry by my self just enough to deal til i could get through the day and then cry all the way home,0
i just want to say you are one brave strong and amazing person for opening up and coming for help i was diagnosed bipolar anxiety and panic attacks 2 years ago i still have those thoughtsthose demons still always try to escape and ruin everything i have and sometimes i almost let them winbut go to him let him help you fight those demons as much as he canhe can make you strongeryou have more strength then you knowget your head up lift yourself up you can do itim fighting them as well right now just knowyou can do itshes proof you can walk through hell and still be an angel,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar anxiety and depression before getting pregnant with my second child pregnancy i took my lamictal and other meds and my psychiatrist said it was fine being a mom with these things has its ups and downs and good days and bad days like most things however a good strong support system and the right meds make it possible and worth it good luck!,1
i feel the same and its hard! the only thing that keeps me going is my kids i have to do things for them and its a daily struggle i hate it i feel like i dont enjoy anything and its sad,0
i absolutely agree in theory (i live a paleo lifestyle & try to avoid medications) but for her to simply open her door walk through it & leave her fears behind is probably not do-able straight up you said it - shes been living like this for 20yrs she will need support strategies & supernatural strength to make this happen im not saying it cant happen im saying it will take time & a plan blessings ,0
this is regressive towards mental health people like myself didnt choose to have this illness; and not all misery needs company sometimes company needs misery,0
i agree if you have a cell phone with an alarm app use that i have trouble remembering my evening and night meds so i have alarms set makes it a lot easier also i had venlafaxine and it worked well for me it was one of the better ones for me but remember everyone is different,1
pregabalin is a very hit and miss drug and i consider it still largly experimental in all fields because there havent been many tests done on it (compared to most drugs) it was designed for neuropathic pain it works somewhat for most anxiety not completely and is addictive despite "expert opinion" i had to ween off it because i got addicted with side effects like euphoria and weight gain to answer the questiom though yes you will likely gain a lot of weight most people do because it slows nerve transmission eventually slowing metabolism,1
it takes time i have been on it for 10 months and mood swings have settled down just make sure you dont hav the shakes or any other sise effect too it took a couple of adjustments to my dose to reach where i am now,1

indeed someone who has no idea what they are doing and forcing you against your will is never okay! i was just saying that positive and monitored exposure is healthy this post kind of makes it sound like people should never face their anxiety idk just how i perceived it i guess,0
i believe it i am 4 years older than my gf and before she was "of age" her mom constantly threatened to get me arrested if i did anything she did not like,1
just dont think about it it happens to me too when i think on it and it used to be worse back after my first anxiety attack where i wouldnt even step foot outside but now ive realized that its apart of life and there isnt anything anyone can do about it so i dont bother thinking about it i think about how to make my time here worth it,0

i lost health insurance recently too and it took calling around to 10 different pharmacies to find pricing to where it was manageable for my 3 meds without insurance ive done cold turkey off my meds before and i dont recommend doing it i was stupid and angry at the world and manic at the time and didnt care until withdrawal came when it comes to your meds i would suggest that you see if you can get samples of seroquel if they still do them keep the lamictal and prozac if you can call around to different pharmacies and do a price comparison my doctor stressed in my situation lamictal was important to stay on,1
on my very first mothers day after years of infertility my husband never even got me a card my son is a teenager now and it still hurts i didnt suffer from anxiety or depression back then so i dont think youre being selfish at all its still hit or miss some years with hubbylast year nothing this year cards gifts and dinner its not about the gifts its about feeling loved and appreciated we all want to feel that regardless of our mental health,0
i disagree hannah nicole lamberth their name includes biopolar which does not if you say lead to self harm conversely depression and anxiety might not all thank goodness as the group says suffer the same but please show support and sympathy if not empathy for those sufferring bipolar/depression/anxiety open page says it all they are an open page i cannot comprehend all thses illnesses but as a carer any information is helpful just as a person too i have no idea who i will meet or what i may become,1
i find my anxiety and depression get worse when its that time of the month i dropped out of college because it was so bad now that im on medication again its getting a lot better i also was diagnosed with ibs definitely talk to your educator or email then about whats going on im sure they will understand and figure something out,1
due to my schizo effective and bi polar i havent been able to hold a job for over 10 years it makes me feel horrible like why cant i be a normal functioning adult and mom at the same time it took a long time and the people who love me and the greatest man i met two years ago to help me realize that i may not be able to work like everyone else but i do a damn good job being a mom and taking care of so much more thats way more important than being a "normal " adult and holding a full time job i got a job only working 3 hours a week and had a panic attack over that but im slowly working on getting there and its helping youll get there too but first thing comes first and that is you if one thing ive learned is you gotta take care of you first i still struggle with that but im getting there and you will too hugs,0
jessica white you should definitely read up on the topic most of the articles and studies that i have read show a direct link between bipolar disorder and dementia apparently people with bipolar disorder have an increased risk of developing dementia i am diagnosed bipolar 1 ocd ptsd w/anxiety disorder and adhd my brain is a mess lol all kidding aside i have also read up on all the medications i am currently taking and have taken in the past medications i need to functionto keep myself alive well many of those medications have unfortunately also been linked to alzheimers and dementia with all this information i would have to conclude that both our illness and medications are slowly wearing away at our minds our memory nothing can function at full speed forever without experiencing some sort of wear and tear some sort of damage even the best and fastest computers eventually start to slow start to become overwhelmed with data start to stall become full stop taking in new data until eventually freezing up and denying you access to the data you did have i think of the brain in the same way with bipolar disorder or anxiety for example comes the whole mind racing symptom our mind refuses to shut down it just doesnt stop just think of our minds as a computer sucks right? educate yourself dont fixate on it knowledge is power even if we only retain bits and pieces lol,1
u r not crazy or alone! seeking help is the right choice! sounds like r going through the same thing i am diagnosed bipolar and trying to get through a major depressive stage but its been super scary ive cut to release the internal pain or hope it will ive gone to the er i constantly trying to get my brain to be a peace and the obsessive thoughts to go away and almost relapsed a few times to make it go away! i keep trying to get better but it like a storm warning to my family and the doctors and they keep ignoring it but try to stay strong and keep fighting to find out what is going on and get the proper meds to at least ease some of it and go to therapy or join a support group or messages me! talking to people going through the same thing or have gone through it also helps! u are in my thoughts ,0

i was on bupropion seroquel hydroxyzine and lamotrigene while i was pregnant doctors wanted to taper and take me off of the seroquel because there was a risk of my daughter going into withdrawals i was unable to decrease let alone discontinue it but when she was born she had no side effects whatsoever i know there are risks taking any medication during pregnancy but the benefits vastly outweighed the negatives my daughter is fine and my postpartum under control but whatever you feel is right for you and your baby is what you should do,0

no problem! also its even possible to feel intensely turned on physically even when you are not even close to being turned on mentally or emotionally especially in situations that remind you of past traumatic events this is actually one thing that i was super ashamed of before finally talking to my dr its basically your brains way of coping with an anxiety inducing situation and/or flashback its a physical manifestation of an anxiety attack no different than hyperventilating for years i felt ashamed and disgusted for having this reaction to certain movie scenes i thought i was a disgusting person for being able to feel sick to my stomach ashamed and aroused at the same time talking to my dr and finding out that w my conditions and history as a victim of violence that it was not uncommon to have these contradicting feelings was honestly life changing being aware that i wasnt some pervert and why it was happening and being able to start acknowledging and processing through those feelings and issues was a huge step in the right direction for my mental and emotional health i wish i would have had such a supportive and understanding dr in my teenage years when i really struggled with things a supportive dr and supportive partner are two invaluable things to have when youre dealing w mental health concerns having a partner who can go w the flow and not question when i need it right that minute or when i just want to cuddle for two months is great it takes the pressure off for feeling like "you should do it because youre supposed to want to do it" and none of those guilt trips for sex when youre in a depressive state sorry i guess ive went much farther into detail than you asked for i guess i just wanted you to know that youre not alone youre not "wrong" or broken for having these feelings and it is completely possible to have a happy healthy sex life and relationship/marriage with these issues once you learn your triggers and moods and communicate w your partner and find a happy middle ground together,0
this just stresses me out more ugh!,0
i hate my depression and anxiety even now weve still got tories and dup government,1
hey there ive had uncontrollable diarrhea for over 9 years now they keep saying its just ibs but ended up taking out my gallbladder due to it being unable to contract because it was full of stones (causing pain under the lower right ribs) but also this is where your liver is have you been checked for elevated liver enzymes? i wasnt until recently and i was diagnosed w fatty liver disease(also called non-alcoholic liver disease) now when i say diarrhea for 9 years im not exaggerating at all it started when i was 21 im now almost 31 it was also painful bloating swelling of my abdomen to the point of looking 6-7 months pregnant nausea loss of appetite and so on apparently my stomach was moving the food through too fast and not allowing time to absorb nutrition from the food leaving me w 6 vitamin deficiencies my dr prescribed an antispasmodic for me about 3 months ago the difference is night and day!!! 3 gastroenterologist couldnt help me after multiple endoscopies and colonoscopies but one dr who listened actually helped i now barely bloat can finish a meal without multiple bathroom breaks and am starting to fit into my clothing again i hope this information helps you please note im also on antidepressants anti-anxiety medication and anti psychotics so it may be a group effort in getting your tummy on track,1

heyyo im 23 so its not like i have arrived or anything but a few things helped me when i was feeling lost and lonely and unsure about my direction: first i think how weve designed school and the continuity from high school to college is pretty unfair my mom changed careers more than 5 times and shes 60 now flourishing in yet another direction! i would strongly recommend taking a break semester or two focus all your energy to change up your field from the current jobs you dont feel joy with do a bunch of new hobbies and maybe taking up a sport or a a rec center if your jobs budget allows it i know too many amazing people who are chained to jobs they hate because they got a degree in something they werent keen on and are now too in debt to experiment travel or start something new learn about yourself what jobs you love (maybe thats just not childcare anymore i tapped out of that gig when i was 21 xd) what jobs you cant do and hate then build from there to see what you want to do with your day and what kind of job lets you do that then what qualifications you need to become the best in that field second nothing made me feel more isolated and depressed than my problematic images of college; dont get me wrong i loved being in college and had an awesome time but after a high school career of having built-in friends based on who was in my 20-30 people classes and watching movies about how college is a nonstop party to find your destiny and make your "real friends" i felt i was doing something wrong when college was exhausting huge nerve wracking and not st all like a sorority movie youre learning how to be a functional adult after being raised in a society that tells teens that their feelings are irrelevant and phasic while also having high expectations and giving them basically no life prep (soooo glad i carried around a bag of flour for a week instead of learning how to access birth control and that i can do advanced calculus but not my taxes :d) that pressure combined with the idealistic image of what college is/should be like can make you feel like a real failure! its not true :) youre just learning how to stand survive and thrive entirely solo and thats hard and thats ok third and less helpfully ive also had a ton of issues with relationships often because i speak different love languages and have different needs (nice way of saying im depressed/anxious/needy) and have honestly found living alone with a dog to be my answer i dont have an aversive view of relationships and will happily take one up but have just experienced from living with partners that i am better in a relationship when i have all the space and independence of living alone it sounds hokey but honestly until you have no fear of living and being alone even love it especially if youre neurodivergent or have particular needs partners can and will use fear of isolation to keep you in situations that do not serve you first (not even necessarily abusive justif you need them cause youre afraid of that isolation they may not view you as precious and may not cherish you the way you deserve it can be tiring to be in a relationship with someone who is anxious and ive had some partners feel over-entitled to my labor in our relationships because they "put up with me") fourth self-care is radical take long baths go for long walks paint sing pet a dog buy yourself flowers if you can afford it the world may feel like its closing in and crushing but it can wait long enough for you to go outside those are the moments youll really remember the memories youll cherish and the substance that makes your life school and qualifications are just supposed to open doors for you to do what you love not loadstones or something to battle through just for that you got this tl;dr: if youre not sure take a break from college and find your passion then go back to school for that society talks up college so we all feel inadequate regardless what we do there get a dog and live alone alone is awesome ;d,0
i learned to do tapping therapy also chinese hand massage and pressure points to relieve stress i put a crystal in each cup of by bra tigers eye for self confidence and rose quartz for love as im very spiritual i also distract myself from what people are doing around me by looking out for white feathers or pennies a sighn my angels are around me although i do really struggle with going into my own garden to cut grass for any length of time or even open curtains most days i can leave my street and be in amongst strangers easier than around my neighbors most times,0
me too one treated me like garbage "heres your prescription next" then i found this one and ill never look elsewhere i have really bad anxiety and he senses my fear and says "candy (thats my name) theres nothing to be afraid of here ok? i wont hurt you no one will hurt you dont be scared of me" because i can be an absolute mess,0
it took me a long time to find the right combination of meds but have finally found one that works and have been on it for a few years now and it does surprise you and even scare you when things finally start to even out i get the fear of the "inevitable" crash but try to be positive because that crash isnt guaranteed,1
i sleep well but only cause i take seraquel at night also the best part of my day horrible hey but i find each day a battle especially the mornings,1
im bipolar 1 with mixed episodes and i totally understand it is very difficult to explain everyone thinks its one or the other your either hi or low but thats just not the case i dont know if i could actually say anything that would help honestly just know that your not alone theres lots of us out there and do the best you can everyday not for anyone else but for yourself i personally feel accomplished when i make it through those horrible episodes because i made it through and you will too dont give up it took me a few doctors and a few decades to find the right meds for me but i finally have now so again dont ever give up you will figure out what works best for you just keep being honest about everthing to your doctors thats whats worked for me,0
pretty hard  i got very parinoid and and got involved in risky behavior within a month of being off meds i halted my meds all together so i feel if it was tapered off it wouldnt have induced symptoms i stabilized after 2 months and then went through the vicious cycle again try tapering off much better effect  i did well that time,1
may i asked how you were diagnosed with a treatment-resistant form? im curious because ive never heard of that and my bipolar type 1 mixed-severe adult adhd general anxiety panic disorder ptsd social anxiety severe insomniaetc have always been difficult to control by therapy meds eastern or western or alternative medicine etc im trying to figure out how i can afford to find the right psychiatrist psychologist/therapist to help me figure out what to do my last therapist and psychiatrist both recognized the stubborn nature of my various disorders but i had to quit my job and i could no longer afford the co-pays for prescriptions and doctor and therapist co-pays i cant go back to see them because i owe their group practice over $600 in co-pays and their billing office and now the collection agency cant seem to give me a break im quite terrified trying to make it without professional help im afraid im stuck,0
remember you are not alone sometimes it just takes a little searching to find someone who understands and will help you and listen with no judgement remember you are a warrior that though there seems to be more bad days than good those good days are going to be brighter and better than anyone else in the world has because we warriors fight harder for those good days we feel them stronger you are a beautiful person take a breath breathe in relaxation and relax the stress as you breathe out you deserve the brightness so fight that dark away!,0
watch your breathing- during a panic attack you will breathe more rapidly and shallowly taking deeper breaths more slowly can help,1

ive also done this before i was so busy doing something else and dont respond to my friends messages but i didnt mean to make her feel like i dont care i always read her messages and it always makes me happy but when its time to reply i get overwhelmed i dont know where and how to start eventhough ive already responded to them in my mind so i always end up not replying and that made her feel like shes not important anymore that ive made new friends and dont need her anymore but thats not true at all yes ive made a lot of friends but its diferrent those new friends although i value them are not as important as her so if youve been there through the hard times i bet your friend has already thought of how precious you are but some of us just suck at showing/expressing it and i think its the same with your friend so i really hope you stay with him he needs you more than you think but of course dont stay just because he needs you stay because you want to hell appreciate that more(i assume since most of us dont want people to stay just because they feel obligated) and if you really wanna get his attention back tell him how you feel or if you cant tell him maybe ignoring him would work? thats what my friend did she didnt just ignore my messages she also unfollowed me on twitter i got so paranoid that time i thought ive gone crazy thought shes not real that my mind just made her to make me feel better that i thought i have a friend but im actually alone its terrifying but that made me become more aware of what she feels and realize shes not like me whos okay with no communication as long as i know shes there(and shes real lol),0

ive personally never had insomnia from it i now take seroquel at night to help with a long term problem with staying asleep the best ever med for anxiety for me has been busparone it worked so well it changed my life i take lamectal (lamotrigine) to stabilizer so my behavior doesnt get extreme venlafaxine as an antidepressant and busparone for anxiety took me about six weeks to get them all to level out i had fatigue headaches and swinging moods but they have pretty much been resolved you must stick with it for 4-6 weeks,1
if youre bipolar you may want to discuss whether or not wellbutrin is right for your condition as it can cause mania since this page is also devoted to people with depression and anxiety as well i can speak from experience as i dont have bipolar but i do have depression & anxiety wellbutrin puts my depression on hold entirely my pervasive thought loops shut down so i can think more clearly my attention is better and so is my ability to concentrate ive also lost about 20 pounds (but i needed to lose weight) bad parts? 1 it makes me jittery and a little twitchy i find myself to be more physically restless so i move around a lot more than i used to 2 it wears off for me late in the evening (as i take it when i first get up in the morning) and my depression can start to rear its head again in the late evening i usually try to offset that by going to bed some people also say that wellbutrin can exacerbate anxiety i cant really tell since my anxiety is so bad anyway that i doubt id notice if it were made a tiny bit worse it would have to make me much worse in order for me to notice but it can (for some people) cause increased anxiety if you have any side effects that are bothersome or that make you feel worse im sure you already know to return to your doctor and get the medication switched i love wellbutrin as its working well for me i wish you only the best of luck with your new medication,1

im 17 years old and have struggled with different mental illness for years and it may sounds hard to believe but until my birthday last year i truly believed there was no feeling better at all with the right people around you and hard work on your behalf there are ways to ease the pain ive found more useful coping techniques from doing my own research as opposed to relying on counsellors and therapists that are only available monday to friday 9 till 5 understanding more about your brain chemistry and why youre feeling the way you do has a greater impact in how capable you feel in managing it weve got it really tough and dont let anyone tell you otherwise its hard enough with hormonal changes going on without added mental illness keep going it will ease with time ,0

i totally agree with all of these comments and i am going to be praying too you are not alone; just look at how all of these people care enough to tell you that its going to be okay that dreadful feeling that youre getting is just anxiety and anxiety is just the physical manifestation of stress its a survival thing that our body is supposed to tell us when we are overwhelmed so that we will know we have to deal with something it gets better now that you know what it is also i have mental illnesses and mine are caused by brain chemical imbalances; when i take my medication and keep my therapy appointments i am a completely different person and functioning in this world is a lot easier i am actually happy and helpful sometimes,0
i hold my breath when anxiety attacksughhh,1
i struggle quite a bit with this i am bp 1 and have learned management tools over the past 27+ yrs but sometimes my demons get so horrible and if triggered the right way i lose the battle i try so hard to fight every day the other night even i got so triggered i carved words into myself to dull the pain  you arent alone i have to hide this now from my daughter and everyone! it sucks!,0

i once had a psychological sort of test before hiring where they even asked you if you had suicidal thoughts lol and all sorts of strange questions so that they could know every aspect of you which in my opinion is nothing else but manipulation those results go to the employer even if they say its confidential haha nothing is confidential with big companies what were they going to do if i said i had big anxiety? treat me like a special case in case i got hired? wtf? anyway disclosing these or not for people with high anxiety at jobs where high interaction and almost constant pressure is present these various disorders are going to show themselves at times whether we like it or not you cant fake it all the time unfortunately haha anyway really sad case here and my point would be just dont be honest to the employers cause theyre only manipulators and can replace you in a second,0

im sorry to hear you feel this way you know its the illness making you feel this way there is a bit of sensibility and logic in what youve written so somewhere in the background you very much want to fight this i want to ask do you take any medication for your condition? do you ever see a doctor please dont think that people are waiting for you to die theyre not this is very much the illness and you have to be strong against it with the right medication you can have a normal life just as an example i have had mental health problems all my life and ive been on lithium duloxitane and amisulpride these drugs of help me maintain a normal life and ive been in my job for 18 years i was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar 27 years ago please do not give up hope please push the paranoid thoughts away and if youre not on meds try and see a doctor your worth it you are in my thoughts ,0

yes to so many of these ideas practicing mindfulness everyday even when i dont have a panic attack lowers the number of days i have panic attacks overall support animals have been a lifesaver for me writing in a journal even things like writing what im upset about onto construction paper using a map pencil and then tearing it up gets some of the energy of it out - an actual physical expression walking yoga or even just stretching and progressive relaxation all help me you can find guided meditations for free on you tube or podcasts and yes deep breathing too and other grounding techniques oh! and yes supplements-wise valerian root and 5-htp are good 5htp is basically tryptophan- the chemical from the turkey that makes everyone want to nap after thanksgiving dinner chamomile tea can be relaxing and the essential oils lavender and cedar wood are both known to promote relaxation/sleep,0

parent support group might really help with the stress of parenting and help you enjoy it! also the doc should ask you a lot of questions like are you sleeping are you irritable do you have racing thoughts and how are you doing at making decisions and good judgementssometimes antidepressants make people have mood swings how are your emotions? how is your thinking? are you thinking a lot of a little? are you impossibly fatigues or full of energy? make a list and tell the doctor these things counselling is really helpful one to one if you find someone you are comfortable with!,1

is god accessible to the depressed? god is so close to his depressed servants that it is as if he resided with the “crushed and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly ones and to revive the heart of the ones being crushed” (isaiah 57:15) how comforting to know that “god is near to those that are broken at heart; and those who are crushed in spirit he saves”!—psalm 34:18 how can the depressed get comfort from god? at any time of the day god’s worshippers have approach to the “hearer of prayer” who can help us to cope with distressing feelings and circumstances (psalm 65:2) the bible urges us to pour out our hearts to him: “do not be anxious over anything but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to god; and the peace of god that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of christ jesus”—philippians 4:6 7 what if feelings of unworthiness make us think that our prayers are not being heard? depression may cause us to conclude that our attempts to please god are not adequate however our heavenly father is sensitive to our fragile emotions “remembering that we are dust” (psalm 103:14) even if “our hearts may condemn us” we can “persuade our hearts” that “god is greater than our hearts and knows all things” (1 john 3:19 20 footnote) therefore you can use expressions in your prayers that you glean from such bible passages as psalm 9:9 10; 10:12 14 17; and 25:17,0
i self medicate sometimes too and all i get is its illegal no compassion! f them! i would most likely be an alcoholic if i could stand the taste of liquor i prefer weed and its my life and my pain that i have to escape from and nobody in my family gives a damn! i moved 400 miles away from all of my family because that was a big problem always being told"you have a great life so why are you so sad?" i tried for years to explain things to them but they seem like they could care less about my depression and anxiety! i moved on december 26 and only 4 of my family members have been in touch i am very fortunate to have friends that care and support me,0

i been through 3 suicides  and was revived and i hear stand  to tell you that you might feel like you are at the end up your rope but there is so much you are needed even if you feel like your daughters do love you they do children always need there parents they might not display it in the way you think sometimes but its proven that all children need there parents i am happy that i am still hear after being in a dark place changing your medication is an option raise your medication raising it does not mean your weak different people need higher doses it ok mental illness cause you to think no one needs you its losing to you i know this is annoying to hear but you have to fight harder then your negative thoughts you probably do that everyday and just breathing is a lot to do for someone that suffers from mental illnessreaching like you did was amendable give your self so credit theres a lot of things you can do that might ease the tension like working out taking additional herbal supplements meditating acupuncture massage juice fasting but when your juice fast you need to take your medication still epson salt baths im not a doctor but these are the things that have worked for me,1
the two of you were separated so technically he didnt cheat thats the one thing he has in his favor but he must not have very much respect for you let alone love if he could go out and sleep with someone else knowing the effect it would have on you my husband actually did cheat on me then he came home and threw it in my face because he knew it would be the one thing that would hurt me the most and to make matters even worse he had the affair on new years which means not only will i always remember the exact day it happened but ill start each new year angry hurt and resentful yeah fun for me i can tell you from experience that it does get easier to live with eventually youll reach a point where its not the very first thing you think about when you wake up in the morning youll always have that brick in your chest where your heart used to be but since its always there youll get used to it and wont notice it so much anymore but there will always be those impossible-to-answer questions thatll cause you to lose sleep at night "does he really love me?" "how could he do this to me?" "why her?" "does he have feelings for her?" "will he do it again?" "am i an idiot for taking him back?" "does the fact that i did make me weak?" "is she better than me?" those questions will drive you insane at night i understand how you feel like you i love my husband more than anything too and its hard to get past a betrayal of that magnitude fortunately my husband didnt get his squeeze toy pregnant so i dont have to worry about her being in my face for the rest of my life and i cant even begin to imagine how that must feel i honestly dont think i couldve handled it so he probably wouldve been gone under those circumstances it just depends on you and how you feel ask yourself which is stronger your love for him or the resentment you feel toward him? you may not have reached the resentful stage yet but trust me you will and keep in mind that men are very physical creatures (shocker) whereas as women are very emotional for them sex isnt always just about pleasure its something they often resort to in times of stress anger sadness and loneliness because their brains arent wired to express emotion like womens are for men sex is often used as an outlet so it could be that he was missing you and just used her to make himself feel better (a lot of women out there are reading that last part going "umm no" lol) which was a really shitty thing to do in my opinion but everyone handles things differently i suppose keep in mind that i am in no way justifying what either of our husbands did men might not be as emotionally complicated as women but they know right from wrong and have the ability to control their actions just like anyone else but if you love your husband half as much as i love mine you wont leave him no matter how many people advise you to so im just trying to help you look at it a different way to give you some peace of mind and hopefully make it a little easier on you youll probably always love him regardless but your feelings for him will never be the same after this so you just have to ask yourself if youre prepared to live with that but youre not "weak" or "stupid" if you choose to stay not that anyone implied that but thats how i spent a lot of time feeling when my husband did what he did id say to myself "how could i possibly take him back after that? i must be crazy normal people dont stay with someone who cheated on them they leave! i must be the weakest stupidest person on the planet" but after a while i realized it was the complete opposite it takes a strong person to stay and get past something like that cuz it hurts worse than just about anything id rather have both my legs cut out from underneath me than ever feel like that again i hope something i said made you feel a little better cuz i know what that kind of heartache feels like and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy it will get easier i promise but your feelings will never be the same,0
i have alarms set in my phone so i never forget my meds if that fils i have a routine breakfast the get dressed and take my meds which are beside my bed with a bottle of water then at night i get changed for bed and take my tablets i take them the same time every day so the routine is pretty much set in stone but the phone alarm is the key to getting a routine started and its important to take meds at the same time everyday so you maintain consistent concentrations,1

if you hold onto anger it just eats away your insides i never raise my voice at my wife so we have never had a fight in 20 years of marriage if you dont yell back at someone they soon calm down i also forgive my family and friends pretty much straight away after an argument cause its no use holding onto the anger you feel i just go on with life and the dark damage that fighting brings does not bother me at all of course i get upset but thats usually at the referees in the footy i love lol i yell at them lifes too short enjoy your family and friends while you have them cause one day you or they will be gone,0
about i wanna say 14 years ago i didnt have a cell phone or a computer thats around the time everywhere i went whatever whoever it was anxiety was running my life so i decided that very casually i would plan out what i called "ecape routes" get to know the area where doors bathrooms and all that seating was important so i would go quietly if i had to at disney world i went into some big auditorium show thing dont remember what it was got my escape route planned im seated then employees started closing thing and more security showed i get a little panicked soon they announce its a surprise taping of "who wants to be a million are!" so of course for security reasons and all no one was allowed in or out i realized at that moment i had to figure something i was panicking at the thought of panici looked at my kids who were having a blast the contestant ended up using the lifeline "ask the audience" soon i gained focuslong story sorry my advice would be have a back up of some kind maybe even to ive always had a back up since that day sometimes i bring something in my pocket i like the apps now one of my backups,0
well what works well for one person may not for another tell your dr that these particular meds make you feel nervous maybe even edgy some meds that ive been on in the past made me feel like i was going to crawl out of my skin! so tell you dr they will then start lowering your dosage and try a different med plenty of meds out there so it may take time to find the right combo if you plan to stop taking them on your own before you can get in to see your dr taperr off them very slowly very slowly cut back a pill at a time but do it every couple 2 weeks if not 3 weeks yes it is a slow process but dont stop abruptly!!! the risks are far to dangerous!! ive had to taper off many meds that made me feel uncomfortable so i speak with many years experience if you can see your dr asap thats the best way to go dont be discouraged that these 2 meds arent working for you like i said theres many many more to try hopefully you find this helpful youre in my prayers!!,1
this whole list (apart from 2) sums me but doctors say i just have bad depression and anxiety could that be the case?,1
one and four on high anxiety days,1
im scared too i get a reaction like a rash light headed and dizzy so now i break it in half i just dont have much energy waiting to see the doctor,0
wish this worked for those of us that have chemical imbalance induced depression and anxiety :/,1
i feel the same way i stopped taking them been taking pills for depression and anxiety for 20 yr now they still couldnt find the right ones so i have the right to give my organs a break but i feel ya about meds ,1
ive had some jobs that sounded great at the time to find that they were meaningless pressure cookers that paid well and didnt really improve the life of anyone around me even providing direct care in hospitals so satisfying and the pay is fair comes with a set of shackles that prevented me from doing the right thing for sick people i dropped out of nursing school with one semester to go i got a masters in social work and am pursuing counseling careers at least i have something to say about the treatment plan ill take a pay cut for that,0
i have been on every man made med since i was 14 and im now 31 i straight up told my doctorsno more medical cannabis is my choice as its natural and great to help me eat and sleep  and calm my horrible thoughts which are constant it isnt for everyone but just thought id throw it out there good luck ,1
the best advice i can give you is to always be honest with people about how you feel and what your thinking they are looking out for your beat interest and will need to know what your needs are on your worst day and your best days  never be afraid to need help it is not a bother to ask questions or seek advice ,0
just my thoughtssometimes we feel so intensly or were completely numb when we are depressed it feels hopeless and it will never be ok but thats not trueim sure youve felt similarly in the past just remember these feelings are temporary in the moment its so overwhelming especially if it goes on for a while i would suggest setting some goals even small ones until you can start feeling hopefull again it creates future thoughts and will help you get back on track((hugs)),0
im in my 28th year of my bipolar struggle but the last 5-6 years have been devastating in the number of psychotic episodes ive hadthey are erratic in length and come way to often sometimes just days between them and i just cant take itmy psychiatrist is just as confused as i amblahhhhjust this year alone ive had 5 manic episodesi just hide away trying to find ways to burn off the energy and i am bad at spending big because i become obsessive in the need to buy lots of stuff for my hobby so no shops and ban ebay and i know confining myself is counter productive because i become paranoid and it just builds up and then the voices starti cant win,0
some people are very bad at under standing those who suffer any illness to me many seem so self righteous children are important so understandably a parent will be concerned that they are capable of doing things the right way therefore they need a partner who is not a selfish prig not self righteous not selfish if he is so selfish & lacking in under standing he will never make anyone happy so ditch him the world is full of kind gênerous & caring men i doubt if he will make any one a good husband let alone a caring father,0
schizoaffective disorder bpd bipolar and anxiety i was getting a monthly injection of invega sustenna then went to an injection once every three months of invega trinza for the most part it worked however the side affects of the trinza were too much for me to handle mentally ive been unmedicated for 2 months and in pretty much hell,1
citalopram and its sister tablet escitalopram are not as severe as most of the other ssris out there in particular sertraline (lustral) seroxat (paroxetine / paxil) and anafranil citalopram takes the edge off the issue and the anxiety / panic but it still allows you to function normally sertraline and seroxat can also cause libido problems in men and women,1
hi suffer bipolar 2 and take fluoxetine which is another name for zoloft this is only for anxiety i was on lamotrogen but never worked for me that was given for my dissociation i tried a lot of other drugs like risperidonequitiapine arripiprazole i am now taking lithium which works for me these are the meds for bipolar so maybe you need to ask to try one of these see how you feel but to me this is why your still struggling because your not taking the right meds hope this helps xx,1
you have had a traumatic experience and there is another way to look at it you can choose to reframe it and give thanks for your survival you can thank the lord for surviving and come to him for healing you may need the meds to help you get through it but time passes i can only say this because i had some pretty bad things happen to me that made me really anxious with panic attacks and sky high generalized anxiety that made it really hard to work and do just about everything i really wish i had taken meds a lot earlier in my life while time goes on you do heal when i was at my worse i had a saying that i told myself i used to tell myself that "things would not always be this way" and that "tomorrow was another day! " i liked another saying that was " every day is a new beginning" this gave me the knowledge that as bad as a day got i could hope for better tomorrows,0
i agree its so damn irritating one person said yo me your meds are making you mad really!!!!,0
i think this is too vague and complex to be answered in the same catch all way because the human experience is just so different due to perspective id like to put in my perspective i think people are both right in different ways selfish is not the right word however what you are describing is actually someone being inconsiderate they have a disregard for their family and friends feelings in the aftermath they are thinking only of themselves but on the other hand this inconsiderate thought is not to be blamed on the suicidal individual in question most suicidal people dont have the capacity to even think that far ahead the future is bleak and dark and full of seemingly endless pain i have struggled with mental illness my entire life i grew up very poor and a homeless youth during this time i didnt even know the thoughts i had were not "normal" my mind a physical being had so much pain it was blinding i attempted 3 times not once did i consider going to family or friends i didnt have family that loved me (still dont) and i didnt have close friends im sure even if i did i wouldnt have been considerate enough of their feelings to persuade me to stay alive for their benefit alone the internal fight isnt about anyone else its only about you its a struggle within to overcome pain and heal what isnt working by therapy meditation lifestyle fitness yoga meditation etc during this time we have to be selfish we have to be inconsiderate because if we arent we will die deciding to live is not for someone else its not for anyone elses benefit its for me im not going to decide against killing myself or mutilation because i think my friend will be sad during the time i was considering it all i did not once stop to think huh i wonder how this will affect the world once im gone no instead i learned to live for myself i recently decided i needed have more serious treatment and went to a doctor when my dad passed away this february i found out im bipolar boarding between 1&2 im somewhere in the middle i also have chronic depression and ptsd from extensive childhood abuse i understand more than ever about my suicidal nature and that it was only my battle and that incredible pain you feel is your brain keeping you alive its far too complex to answer this question but it could provide insight to others that it is not an act of selfishness its an act of inconsideration its also an act of survival stop calling suicidal people selfish they have enough pain weighing them down they already spend every waking moment thinking things that would kill a person of less grit and perseverance (literally) instead what you can do show them you are there for them dont try to pull out information trying to understand it all it doesnt work that way but being there helping them eat keep them safe and supervised help them clean up enrich their life by taking walks or finding small joys make them realize that life is good life is beautiful and people love them even if they dont love themselves but please dont add to their hurt by calling them selfish youre only pushing them further,0
i feel for you so much i know exactly what you are going through i have alot of things from my past that has completely messed my head up good but this past year has pushed me to my breaking point its been especially hard i wont bore you with my life story or the details and im ashamed to admit ive resorted back to alot of my old bad habits just to try and get thru another day i cant tell you how to fix it but i sure hope things get better its not fair to feel this low its not your fault i know that i dont know you but i can def relate and i hope the very best for you i truly do i hope you find true happiness and it stays with you forever idk why but your post really stuck out to me maybe because im feeling the same and i know how i hurt and i dont want to think of someone hurting this bad sending love ❤❤❤,0

borderline personality disorder like all other personality disorders is an abnormal way of perceiving and interacting with the world think of it as having a dirty filter that the sufferer sees the world through constantly we do not believe it is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain but its possible that some of the symptoms might because medication *can* help some sufferers (but doesnt help everyone) because they perceive things incorrectly they often react inappropriately to situations that occur people with bpd typically (not always as there is some room for deviation) have problems with emotional regulation and may react incorrectly to unexpected situations that occur they may be perceived by others as being moody and reactive they often have problems with trusting other people its believed this occurs because of unhealthy childhood experiences with parents caregivers teachers and peers however there may also be a genetic propensity for people to have bpd as well regardless they tend to have short-lived intense relationships with lovers where they cling one minute and push away the next they often have issues with infidelity due to a fear that they will be abandoned theres a real fear of abandonment and rejection they tend to have black and white thinking (things are all wrong or all good) and that means they often either idealize or villainize their lovers depending on their mood this leaves the lover often feelling like they dont really know whats going on or where they stand in the relationship one minute the lover is being adored and the next they are being pushed away if theres infidelity or other types of self-damaging risky behavior occurring the lover may eventually get fed up because of this behavior and their intense lack of trust quite oftenthe sufferer does cause their lover to leave them this of course reinforces their belief that they will always be abandoned left and/or aloneand the cycle of clinging/pushing away starts again with a new person usually quite soon afterward it should be notedthis black and white thinking tends to color their perception and behavior in regards to themselves their self esteem their self concept and the world around them quite often they are hypersensitive to criticism (or even perceived criticism) this goes back to that deep seeded fear of being rejected or abandoned more than likely they lived in a household situation with a parent or caregiver who wouldone minute seemingly dote on the child and the next without obvious reasonpush the child away inconsistent inattentive cold neglectful or absentee parenting seems to be a big part of the reason a person with bpd may have had it develop since we learn to trust from the first people in our lives (usually our parents)if a parent proves to be untrustworthy absent cold or inconsistent with affection/punishmenta child may learn that they cant trust anyone deep down people with bpd dont always trust themselves either because they tend to have very black and white thinking they dont always handle situations very well this "just world" concept where they seem to think that "good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people" can cause them to see themselves as bad/evil/wrong if something bad happens to them even things they cant control in addition they often have feelings of intense anger if things dont go as they expected especially if it deals with other people their expectations of other people are usually unrealistic (because their expectations of themselves and the world are unrealistic generally) they may get physically violent or abusive when things dont go the way they expected during a period of devaluation of their love partner they may become violent or abusive (note: this doesnt happen with every bpd sufferer but it is a common enough occurrence that it should be said) they have intense changes in feelings and react quickly to situations without always thinking things through they can be self-damaging and impulsive this is where people get it confused with bipolar disease because bipolar tends to cause highs and lows and emotional reactivity during those periods people with bpd have this issue all the time howevernot just when they are experiencing a disease relapse from one extreme or the other,0
i always dream that im dreaming in my dream that i dreamt about im dreaming about dreaming and in the dream im upset because i cant remember what it is ive dreamt,0
this is going to sound fucked up but i love being hospitalized yes i have been put in restraints given shots woken up at 5 in the morning for blood and miserable while in them but they have taught me so much i hate being in hospitals but i hate leaving them they are pure hell but at the same time i never want to leave its the one place where i feel safe where i know i am not going to kill myself because quite frankly i dont want to die i try to kill my self but i dont want to die i have voices in my head who want me to die i am not always in control i am always scared of what i will do to myself and thats why i like them its a safe haven where people understand and dont think your crazy its a place where you can not be afraid and learn how to control the things you wish to yes i do self harm in hospitals but i have people there to help me cope and learn other things to do you learn life skills that you dont find elsewhere i hate them and im terrified of them while i am in but secretly love them at the same time i mean i have spent so long in them they are like a second home i never want to be hospitalized again but if i do something to be needed to go back then i would go back knowing that its for a good reason am i need the help,0
i was lithium for almost 10yrs & i never had a problem  but every person is different on kilodopin for anxiety & albilify for paranoia good luck,1
ive been on it for probably 12years or so its the one medication that my doctor has never taken me off of or changed (not quite sure why) im on a pretty high dose of it i dont quite remember what side effects i had at the beginning but i do have certain side effects now i normally take it at night before going to bed if i happen to drink or eat anything after taking more often than not i get a feeling come over me like im drunk my doctor could never explain if thats a true side effect but its been happening to me the whole time i take it as well as if i miss a dose that following day my body is extremely shaky (even feels like my body is shaking from the inside) and i cant seem to focus correctly until i take it again,0
whats your dose? im struggling on 150mg think i need more gp is reluctant to put me up or try something new,0

back in 1999 my mom and sister told me i should let my daughter go stay with my sister for a little while i did because i was pregnant and couldnt take my meds my mom and sister made a plan to have me sign papers for brianna to be able to stay for the summer it turned out they were actually adoption papers as i was off meds i was confused and signed the papers not fully understanding what was going on adoption was final 2000 my sister never let me se or talk to my daughter again my daughter passed away in 2002 from heart complications in 2012 my ex took my son away from me the judge stated because i had been hospitalized for 5 weeks i must have been suicidal or homicidal therefore making my ex a better person to parent i had my son for 15 years! people make me so angry judging me for my mental health!,0
julie completely understand all of this my parents (and us) are going through it also my stepdad was given 6 months-a year last october your thoughts and feelings are exactly what hes been dealing with and its so difficult to watch and try to put ourselves in his shoes i cant imagine how he or you feel he has finally come to accept this fate and has made (somewhat) of peace within he does still worry about when hes gone and if my mom will be ok im sure thats one of your main concerns tohow could it not? i feel for you two and think of you often ,0
are you girls seeing gynocologist you may have hormonal disorders i had same problems was diagnosed with polysistic disorder although im also bp1 with panic anxiety kinda sounds like it coincides!,1
i was the same way i was treated for anxiety and depression but i noticed the meds i was on wasnt really working i tried several different kind then i found out that bipolar runs in my family i talked to my doctor and i am finally on the right meds and i feel like a new person,1
keep searching for the thing that works for you and the way of life you need to stop you struggling change is difficult talk and talk to those you trust life can be a struggle but make it your struggle for what you truly need and want sometimes and often its the simplest of things and sometimes not things at all but feelings - peace calm the mind,0
i would also try to reach out to the neighbor and gain their sympathy or  ask the landlord /manager if the door can be muffled or put on one of those hinges that control how fast or slow the door closes so that it closes slower however i have been in similar situations and have seen the supposedly gained sympathy and understanding bear little other fruit its harder but much more effective to reduce your hope of changing other peoples actions and try to decondition yourself as much as you can even if its just a little increasing your tolerance and flexibility will serve you and others the most in the long run i also have a lot of anxiety and have been troubled by loud sudden noises ironically i have an emotional support dog who also hates sudden loud noise especially of the bang variety his barking and my needing to comfort /quiet him have actually helped increase my tolerance of such sounds whatever happens i have faith in your ability to find resolution! the situation cant go on forever best luck,1
how can you even win with answering this question the people we leave behind are going to say we r selfish but we know we are not and have validated that in our own mind trying to convince the people that are left behind that in fact we werent being selfish is something they cannot understand mental illness and the suffering that we go through is not any different than any other debilitating illness if we have come to peace with those terms to end our suffering remember it is ours than that is by our choice my children have watched a lifetime of a sick mother and a well mother and although if this was my choice to end my life yes they would be sad but would completely understand and not for a minute say that i was being selfish being raised with a mentally ill family member they have learned that ultimately this could happen i could also have a heart attack too would they be any less upset no,0
i have two autistic sons theres no fix let alone a quick fix autism is to be taken much more seriously than that if there were a fix believe me millions of people would have been onto that a long time ago it does not exist & im not sure one ever will so bipolar & similar disorders are something that are usually developed over time you are born with autism my sons have what is called co-morbid diagnoses meaning they have more than one diagnoses being asd (autism spectrum disorder) gad (general anxiety disorder) & adhd (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) which makes for a very potent mix but they are classified as high functioning meaning they function at a higher capacity than other asd sufferers there are three degrees or levels of function high moderate & low the less a sufferer is able to do for themselves the lower the level of function you need to contact a gp (general practitioner) to request a referral to a specialist in asd this specialist may want to do their own assessment of you to gain a starting point then they will generally become your therapist/gp who will guide you & medicate you if required please remember though there is nothing wrong with you you have the ability to see the world & everything in it differently & who is to say that this is wrong? you are special & i know that you would have skills & strengths that you could tap into like the arts writing or painting to name just a few do not waste ant talent or interest you have this is how asd people function best good luck laurie ,0

i have to set alarms i have at least 2 alarms set daily so i dont forget and its funny how some people think its impossible to forget and at this stage it should be but i have been taking pills for epilepsy for at least 8 years anxiety depression and bipolar all came in to play slowly over time my depression came in at least 15 years ago and my anxiety was diagnosed about 4 years ago and bipolar was last october even with all my alarms i still tend to forget to take them til hours later and i take at least 19 pills a day set as many alarms as necessary i get busy and i just shut off my alarms and keep doing my thing doesnt matter how many years you take medications for its still beyond easy to forget,1
i only feel lonely when im not scared,0
i was guinea pigged with vistaril and it had no reaction with me prob ably because its original intended use is for blood pressure i got so tired of being put on meds that had other intended uses and treating anxiety was just a possible side effect,1
all i ÷ver hear is how crazy and psycho i am i just cant take it anymore after 8 years and many ups and downs we have decided to split up i know in my heart it is over i am so terrified i am going to fall into depression or mania which she predicted and some other very harsh things im just tired of the stigma and falling in it sometimes it sucks thanks for the rant,0

hearing voices are common symptoms of major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety once you feel better you wont hear it anymore but your other symptoms do sound like symptoms of bi polar disorder,1
i took it for my panic disorder along with prozac i took it at night since its basically a strong benadryl it helped me make sure you adjust the dosage to what works for you because if you dont sleep it off it will make you groggy,1

i have driving anxiety (cuhz my siblings were killed by automobile incidents) and not knowing what other drivers are going to do or how they drive really gets my nervous however i smoke weed for my anxiety i dont smoke enough to get high just enough to calm my nerves and i never smoke indica before driving i stopped taking pharmaceuticals years ago because they only helped if i was taking super high and unsafe doses,1
i feel every word you have written in my heart and souli am 40 years old and have struggled for 30 years to cope with myself the self harm and suicide attempts are getting worse by the day i have 4 older boys wich are the only thing that keeps me alive but im afraid i havent got any fight left wich inturn leeds me to more despair ,0
i disagree with this statement i was raised right but it itsnt my mothers fault if i was diagnosed with bipolar depression and anxiety sometimes i lose my temper almost everyday dealing with ignorant people that do not understand what others go through without medication without insurance and no doctors its a struggle point blank i was raised by the greatest mother ever rip ,1
been on it almost 4 months have had a slow steady increase of dozage over quite a period of time dont know yet if it will work for me over a longer period of time sideeffects? hmm for the last 3-4 weeks ive had very bad anxiety - a type ive never experienced before its been so bad that its led me to develop pattern of ocd-like thinking and actions this anxiety makes me exhausted also more irritated (borderline aggressive) mentioned this "new" to my caregiver since i myself think this anxiety level and mood may be sideeffects of lamictal however psychiatrist does not think so dont know if others have experienced similar(by the way; am swedish and over here the drug often is called lamotrigin),0
this isnt a prescription med but this seriously helps me!!! a company called m network makes mstiks and there is one called soul and what it does is calms you down puts your mind to ease allowing the never ending thought of worry to die down if you drink it a hour before you want to sleel it will actually help you sleep its all natural you put it in water it tasts amazing if youd like a sample you can pm me,1

no one told life would be easy but i know how you feel struggling your way back in is the hardest thing to do since you dont have any track of yourself anymore lets try our best to keep going in this cruel world were all here for you ,0
anxiety drains the life from you,1
most people with this illness need medication to me its a quality of life choice i take the minimum amount of medication to control my disease because the quality of my life is better with it than without it why choose misery over relative wellness? i dont want to just survive i want to live,0
its nothing to be embarrassed about eitheri feel the same way at times and most people do,0
yes it is so scary i also have extreme anxiety among other things i am on a couple anti-anxiety meds and they help some but not all together for me when i am at that point i dont know if anything med wise would work of course i am no doctor just try and take it a day at a time sometimes that is all we can do also open up to your doctor maybe they can help,1

patti erdman i was so ocd about everything had its place and if it was moved a 16th of an inch i went nuts the stuff had to be perfect i went so far as toothbrush and toothpicks in the cracks on the floor (tile floor) i hated it and i have shedding petslol sadly after the death of my boyfriend in september i went thru such a bad depression that my whole home went to shambles and i didnt care over the winter i shut down all rooms in my house except for my living room and bathroom the above photo is how bad my depression became and i didnt care  and that was my damned kitchen then we changed a couple of my meds (raised the dose) and i woke up one day toward the end of march and walked into my kitchen and was in shock i had been so bad with the depression i had not even realized what i was doing that photo was taken when i was about a quarter of the way done with cleaning it all up ive never in my life lived like that before and id been homeless for a bit way back and was cleaner then that it scared me to see what i was doing and not even being aware of my surroundings and i never ever want to become that depressed ever again for any reason thank god id shut off that part of the house before i ended up dead in that garbage pile or my pets did ppl who dont understand how debilitating depression can become can gladly borrow my photo to show that someone is literally go out of our minds with it,0
i have everything you listed above my so was taking mirtrazipine for his insomnia but i took some once to see if they helped me long story short nothing helped me then again i only took one prescription or type of med at the same time was never on any sort of cocktail i know that for me the antipsychotics dulled me and the antidepressants just made me want to hurt myself even more the anti anxiety worked but only one type and theyre so hard toget here anyway what ended up working for me was spending more time outside meditation yoga and spending time focusing on me meditation helped a lot with the disordered thoughts and the psychosis other than that i would say you might benefit from finding a doc you trust and a therapist that will listen to you and help you try to navigate the pathways of your mind if you wanna chat my inbox is always open wishing you the best,1
you are never alone! a lot of people understand a lot of people will help there are suicide hotlines amongst others go to a hospital reach out i know its terrifying but you have to take that first step please! sending you huge hugs lots of love and an infinite amount of prayer that you find the help you need to live a healthier life btw you are amazing! it took so much courage to reach out like you did! bravo! god bless!,0
dosage may be to high lithium when husband was on it he could not drink soda and they would do blood work every two weeks to ensure his levels were not too high you can actually get lithium poison if not monitored and can make you feel worse he only was able to drink gatoradewater and ginger ale zoloft is hit or miss but i would ask them to reduce the dosage to 25 and add hydroxizine tartate for sleep and anxiety attacks wellbutrin stay far far away because that shit dont work and makes you feel more suicidal at best lithium i dont recommend because my husband was on it and killed himself i just say the amount he was on was high in correlation between other medications he took it for epilepsy and bipolar disorder but i would ask for the 25 mg of zoloft clonzapam works wonders but most doctors will not prescribe it due to being a narcotic,1
i am so glad people are finally understanding this as it absolute truth and there is nothing to be ashamed of!!!!,0
hi katie what have you tried so far? i struggle at times my concentration isnt usually good when im like that and go from one thing to another i keep lots of things in my handbag to fiddle with i colour im having a go at journaling including a mood tracker i create upbeat play lists for the day time meditation ones for the evening and if all else fails i try to sleep i hope you are okay the most important thing whatever happens is to be safe if you find you cant control your urges please visit your emergency room ~vw~,0
im embarrassed to admit this on mothers day i fell asleep (dont even recall lying down) i didnt wake up till 8:45 pm we were supposed to have dinner etc i missed all of it nor did i call until i woke at 8:45 the worst part is that im 40 years old i absolutely felt like crap possibly ask your mom if she could teach your daughter to do these things i was raised by a single mom as well it never occurred to my brothers to get my mom a card & gift once i took them out shopping for her they got the hang of it i do feel for you though it must really hurt to not even get a 99 cent card on mothers day:-(,0
i went through about 12 years wanting sex of all kinds thats when i found out i was bi sexual and i went crazy having sex with folk guys and chicks (mainly chicks of course) but since xmas this year ive done it like 3 times its all kinda worn off now which is a shame i miss iti think about it but my fella doesnt wake up,0
omg i struggle with this daily it so hard,0
are you connected with a counselor or therapist? it is possible to do some visualization/cbt/anxiety reduction in preparation for the placement that could make it very possible,1
paranoia and anxiety both were largely increased on lithium suidical thoughts for me were daily too lithium and depakote were terrribleeeeeee for my mental and physical health but everyone is different ive heard more bad then good about lithium though,1
please please hang in there hun it sounds as though things are at an all time low things can get better im not sure where you are so am unsure what services you can access so its hard to know who might be able to help but others have suggested places to try if you are in the uk surely you can have joint access at least to your son? i hope you have good and appropriate professional support to help you could they help with some sleeping tablets to help in the short term? having no sleep can make everything so much harder just for a temporary measure? im not sure how old your son is but whatever age he needs his mum and he needs her well and happy i hope you can find the strength to beat this for him and for yourself do you have people to lean on? xx,1
pls talk to doc before stopping meds i was a size 8 when i was put on seraquel  was taken off due to wait gain struggled to loose it for months & as the lbs slowly began to shed i decided to stop my lithiun (900 mg daily) i ended up sectioning myself i got out went back on both previously mentioned meds the weight came back plus some made it up to over 200 lbs & had to sqeeze into size 22 told my doc i felt the weight gain negated/out weighed the mental gains now i`m about 8 mo on just lithium & ambien i tried everything to slim down: veggies & water sweat & tears no processed sugar in the house (my teens l~o~v~e~d that one) accountablity partners nothing helped i went through another anerexic stage (not sure of correct term but i wouldn`t reccomend it) now i`m a snug size 12/14 & scared my stupid brain won`t know when to stop loosing weight,0
i agree time to go to a doctor i would also suggest its time to see a therapist as they will be able to teach you the skills and techniques you need to manage your anxiety and depression as medication alone will not cure you,1
if you cant get a script right away try cbd oil marijuana it will calm your anxiety i too have bipolar disorder 1 borderline anxiety it helps with the rougher spots i take a mixture of medication for my bipolar and my anxiety many drs today are trying to stay away from narcotics because of abuse you may have to try a mixture of meds before you find the right cocktail that will work for you good luck god bless! and support groups are great if you have them available!,1
my friend i totally understand your pain while there are some good suggestions given here the only way to rid your face is going to be inside out! i had severe cystic acne not just a few whiteheads and some blackheads im talking sever cysts and redness all over my body it was horrific and bullying doesnt do justice what peers said and did to me! first let me implore to you you are worthy you are valued and loved despite what others may say your outward appearance does not define you and if people are bullying you well there is something wrong with them not you!! there are many treatments for severe acne and none of them have to do with greasy foods or to much chocolate stigmas absolutely exist with acne just like mental illness find a dermatologist and ask him to explain how accutane works you must be diligent with blood work and follow up with drs but i promise you it will be very worth it not only did it work for me but because it is hereditary my son got it bad as well i immediately put him on this treatment with dermatologist supervision and within 1 school year he went from redness and cysts to not one blemish or pock mark on his face!! and went on to enjoy the last few years of his high school term i refused to allow him to go through the horrific things that severe acne suffer with please please if you want relief from this find a dr and get started if you have any problems getting the right info please do not hesitate to inbox me and i will help you as much as possible!!! your life is so valuable and you are a blessing to many people even if it doesnt feel like it at the moment!!! please dont give up!!!,0
erm how about telling her no fucking way!!! she chose this life she needs to deal with it she should have thought about that before she thought she was in the book 50 shades of grey & its not fair to confuse your little boys xxx,0
bipolar/anxiety/depression open page,1
ya it happens i sometimes need to take sleeping pills or anxiety reliever bt now i ve been taking it continuously for a month and nobody knows about it,1
thanks for the supportive comments and suggestions  i still feel so hopeless and worthless and depressed and anxsious and insecurities and self hate and pain hurt sadness despair and sorrow  its not getting better  im tired of pretending to be strong and tired of pretending im ok im just fed up  but the positivity has helped in encouraging me  feel like giving up still  see no point in going on i appreciate the kind words though i just dont know how i going to get through all this cuz its m really struggling  ive been strong to long  im fed up,0
first off i want to admit im not a doctor and im ignorantok? why cant it be both? people having had trauma having babies and raising them will not be perfect or any person for that matter wouldnt their children be more susceptible genetically through trauma to be diagnosed dont make it more complicated than it needs to be theyre/you are hurt and need helpend of the story the question is irrelevantjust more anxiety,0
im the same but frightened to change and worried that everything might go wrong i dont do change very well im a creatures of habit and change scares me maybe part of my anxiety we have so many barriers to try and cross because of our illness but we should give ourselves a pat on the back because we actually get up and go to work its such a hard thing to do for us but we do it ive tried looking for other work but when i see the application form my mind goes blank and i have no idea what they are wanting me to say i talk myself out of it then and think im not good enough for anything else hopefully one day day we have the strength to make the change good luck x,0
i was denied initially which is common unless you are mostly dead i got a lawyer and we have been working on it hes handled everything contacts my drs sends them questioners and collects the information we need i finally just got my hearing date in september (its been like almost 2 years since i appealed) my drs are fully behind me and my lawyer knows he doesnt get paid if i dont get get the disability so many times if they feel there is no chance they wont take your case at all i have a hard time talking about my mental issues but hes told me that is not the day to to hide away and pretend it is all ok dont lie dont overdue it but be honest about your worst days what its truly like for you you have 30-40 minutes of me and the judge asking you questions about your mental health please dont tell us youre ok when youre not there is also another person i guess that will be there that will be judging my answers and information and in his opinion am i able to work he has never met me and is simply going by the hearing my lawyer and the judge will question him too then it can be a while before i get my answer about the hearing as well my psychiatrist told me she believes ill get it and she cant believe i am not on it already she was very clear in her opinions my therapist is being grilled and she is very clear about how detrimental it is for me to work ive also got spine issues (4 spine surgeries in 2 years chronic migraine syndrome that actually landed me in the hospital for a week last month) so they are submitting those files too and asking my neurologist for his input there is no point asking my ortho surgeon my lawyer says ortho surgeons are almost impossible to get to help with disability benefits so it can be done but its a long frustrating road they usually will back date your payments to the original date you applied if you get a lawyer they will take a percentage of that which is a small price to pay to not have to navigate through this alone ive not heard many people win this on their own ive got bi polar 1 rapid cycling with psychosis ptsd anxiety and borderline personality disorder hope this helps answer some of your questions,0
not everyone is capable of handling the stress of being with someone with a mental illness and thats okay its better to know your limits then put you and the other person in a situation neither can handle it may seem shallow to you nick kemp but its more about being realistic in what you can handle,0
lol how can you read my comments on here?? i dont care that you can but can others? im brutally honest on these sites because o feel like there is no judgment and i dont know anyone lol my attacks are causing me to question do i need mental help? like im terrified to be one my own what happens when my anxiety hits am i going to be able to care for my kids properly?? my head is a mess my thoughts come and go so quickly and mix with each other im like unable to function some days i feel like im rocking the world and then other days i feel im letting the world down and am a huge failure to everything i have tried in my life i love my kids but i question my strength im tired of feeling this way i want to wake with energy and filled with life i dont know how i have people telling me how and it sounds great and something i am interested in but am i strong enough lately i dont have the strength to run to the mailbox ,0
amen god taught me so much through my struggles,0
im manic depressive and have anxiety theres days where im petrified to leave the house because i just dont want to have to talk too or deal with peoplei told my boyfriend now my husband when we started dating if they care about you it wont matter just be you if there not ok with it then there no worthy of you,0
if its working x dont worry they only say that because it seems to help more with the depression side of things which bipolar 2 peeps seem to suffer more from i am bp2 and just tried it last resort getting desperate and i had a life threatening reaction to it so count yourself lucky youve found something that works i have been battling rapid cycling and major depression looking for the right meds for 2 years now but im overly sensitive to everything the only thing saving me at the moment is valium and lots of it trust me if it works dont worry what its meant for which is actually epilepsy by the way ,1
yes ive been on both  i dont have any med s i cut myself down slowly and never bothered again  i do get odd bad day and still feel anxiety at times but i try and stay away from stressful people and situations just keep happy people around and situations i also started going to church god helps a lot too xx,0
thats the whole thing stuggling but a hole nother thing when it comes to struggling alone!!!! i wish the stigma of having a mental illness would just disappear what makes me the saddest is people serounding me (closets family ) telling me get over it its your own fault your like this and the best oneits all in your head get a grip sometimes wish they could walk in my shoes for 1 day just 1 dayits utter hell! if they see this post so what all that will be said isooooops there she goes again ,0
i wish i had advice i have just been diagnosed bp2 and have the same thing happen my last boss would make me feel so bad about myself i ended up quitting before i had a new job lined up and life has been hell same experience though i would get worked up and get emotional/ mostly cry and he would judge me and make me feel less than a person and incompetent like i couldnt do my job i hated working every day and now im not sure if its my meds not working or if im just so over stressed making 1/3 of my previous wage and being uncertain daily of how im eating/paying bills/ putting gas in my car to get to work that i end up crying at work every day still (luckily not in front of a boss or customers) i cant take it much more hang in there hopefully someone can give us something helpful! ,0
i used to be you dont worry youre not alone we are even the same age sometimes the things that should make us happy get to be over whelming where do we go from here please work on making small reachable rewarding goals for yourself when you feel like self harming play with your children be goofy force yourself to live ive also started cbd it has worked wonders for me ive also made some other changes as i suggested and im slowly figuring out that my life my journey all depends on me i have the power to control my thoughts they dont control me i hope you can find better outlets until your meds can be fixed stay strong and hang in there youre loved more than youll ever know,0
yes i do been trying for 6 yrs to shake the horrible feelings i have about myself need a new dr,0
a lot of these are on point i relate the most to replaying conversations wondering if i did something wrong when someone doesnt respond right away beating myself up constantly and fear of mistakes my anxiety in my opinion is the one thing out of 2 things ive been diagnosed with that i just cannot get a handle on at all therapy has helped my depression and self harming with added meds but i just cant get the thoughts of being a massive failure and screw up to stop that and the suicidal ideation constant thoughts of "everyone would be better without me" and "im replaceable",1
first of all if your boss is using offensive words you need to go higher is there a human resources department or a union rep or someone you can confide in? that should not ever be something an employee goes through whether youre dealing with your own personal issues or not do not believe what he said about venting that was entirely uncalled for if you have close friends or a family member or sibling you trust please please reach out people will surprise you thats one issue i struggle with my partner surprised me when i told him i had an episode this weekend he was genuinely worried and told me to call him next time (hes away for work) do you draw or have any extra curriculars/artistic talents or other hobbies? what about something like ripping paper when you get the urge to cut? have you seen a doctor or psychiatrist/counsellor? i encourage you to add that to your list it wont "solve" your problems but having that unbiased person you can talk to may help you make the changes you need please find the emergency numbers for your area theres several online resources you can even do online counselling if youre worried or not up for face to face! i hope you know you are not insignificant youre someones child friend and so much more the negative thoughts are one voice right now theyre just much louder than the positive voice take care and hugs!,0
for anxiety is lorazepam ok better take first the anxiety away and take a moodstabilisator olanzapine can help low doses,1
i just read that lithium has been approved for pregnancies the risks to the fetuss heart are not what they thought,0
always make a list that way you wont forget in fact my partner has a meds review tomorrow and i have already written down two questions i need to ask if you struggle to talk take someone whom you can talk to and get them to speak on your behalf i have spoken on my partners behalf for 6 years she expects me to do the right thing by her and that is what i do good luck,0
being alone sucks and is scary,0
ive seen some pretty awesome tattoos to cover cutting scars my son cut for a short period of time we were moving from california to louisiana he was so upset about moving thats when it started i immediately took him to his psychiatrist he was 14 now hes 18 he hasnt cut since,1
im sorry for what youre going through i have crippling anxiety as well as chronic pain throughout my back partly due to genetics and partly due to being rear-ended by an 18-wheeler ten years ago i wake up every day in constant pain and my anxiety has only gotten worse over time between the two issues i cant hold down a job and i dont feel understood at all i have a daughter to provide for and im ashamed that im not doing well financially you arent alone,0
kristi dietz thank you so much for this comment we are not alone in this struggle bipolar disorder never gives me a rest and i think you put it best when you described how all its "a daily exhausting struggle talking yourself down or up all day long" were planners through and through haha,0
i do not suffer from bp but a caretaker for a son that has it also his older brother suffers from severe anxiety and depression we have all 3 been on lexapro i take it just for anxiety and the older brother has said it saved his life i get nauseous very easily but it has not effected to one bit but we have been told ssris should not be given to people with bp,1
that is horrible im sorry to hear that,0
to help calm anxiety during the storm; try using headphones and having your favourite song on repeat (if possible) or try thinking about the storm being someone moving furniture hope that helps,1
its a real struggle for me these last few months,0
the hospital is rarely like that its scary when it happens though i sympathize with that i can relate to a lot of what youre saying hang in there things swing around eventually ,0
true story!! others think you just stop because other people have "real" things to worry about,0
if only people knew the battle it is everyday to fight the anxiety to jump out of bed and smile when deep down your really struggling sometimes i feel best to pretend your over the top happy as it feels to me no one really cares hugs allxoxo,0
donald jose khairullah that must be horrible d8 i am so sorry sweetie your brain must be hating so much on itself so much of the time i hope you find a way to work through and find a partner who is willing to work through it with you <3,1
u will not lose ur kids if u get help thats absurd if anything it shows ur taking care of urself i live in the states as wellive been hospitalized a few times and still have my childthere was never a threat that i wouldnt so please dont let that deter u from getting help,0
i went through this when i first started my job it did last about 2 years you may be different but eventually it does go away it is important that you take your medication even if you do feel well like you i hear voices if i dont take my meds the anxiety is just another aspect of your illness so you need to take your meds just to let you know ive been in my job for 18 years you can do this to without your medication you are very much on an edge and could trip over at any time the anxiety your feeling about working is because its new and unknown dont leave yourself vulnerable without your medication ,1
i use a dosset box and set an alarm,1
i like it but the irritability bothers me some and the cockyness of me not caring what my decisions do to my family bothers me but not enough to stop me doing it i live at the bottom of the wave so much that surfing the top right now i just want to ride and let loose i know ill crash bit until then surfs up,0
a family session can be helpful you need to be ready for that though having a family session may allow for them to gain an improved understanding of your symptoms and moods this may also allow for you tho better understand what they are having difficulty with i relating to you not as one weigh mi rather as the family you are you are working already ight sounds like on insight sand awareness keep at it try not tho be discouraged by the actions of other ultimately we are responsible for our own happiness i struggle to with relationships so i appreciate what you are dealing with good luck,0
i take the exact same mg and the first time i drank with it it definitely caused me to have a panic attack drinking while taking fluoxetine can cause your nervous system to intensify i still drink once every other weekend but i only have a drink or two and it basically feels doubled i get tipsy a lot faster since i take this medicine ive definitely cut back on my alcohol intake,1
i have a couple of easy suggestions that i was able to do that helped tremendously in regards to your ged try to find a free short class to help you pass your ged; they have them all over probably even online these days or go to your local public library and study theyre book for geds i think you might have to do it there but not sure and take the get practice tests to see if there is anything on each one that you need to study or learn then take the practice tests again before you go to take each ged test that way you get rid of any doubt or anxiety and save yourself some time then go for it it looks to me like you can do this so good luck with the new job when you get one,1
i know im not theone that wrote that but some of what was stated is exactly what im going thru ive been on meds since the end of jan- first part of feb of this year i went to jail for discipling my child and since then ive been without a job which is stressful living with my mom who gives into my sons every whimper i know i cant give up because of my son but what do you do when you have no one in the home that is willing to talk to you? when you are so angry that you blame god for putting you thru all of this stress? i have suicidal thoughts several times a day especially when my son pushes my buttons and then when i yell he tells me he wants me to die it is very hard but trust me going to a place once a week at a church will help ive started going to a group that is mainly for addicts art a church and ive been getting more and more into reading the bible and trying not to yell as much when he pushes my buttons whoever this anonymous person is if you would like to reach out for someone to talk to please feel free to send me a private message,0

it is such a destructive illness and everything is so much more complicated in a relationship where bipolar is present i know as i am the partner in one loving a partner with bipolar is difficult the bipolar turns them into somebody that you dont recognize somebody thats not the real person you fell in love with instead of being an equal partner in a relationship you are expected to be a carer when they suffer depression and you have to suffer the emotional abuse often on the other end of the scale bipolar has robbed me of all my trust in my relationship but i am hanging in there perhaps your partner is afraid to face the bipolar situation? afraid that he has lost the person he loves? its lonely being the partner of a sufferer i sometimes feel alone when i am sitting in the same room as my wife escapism to a certain degree is natural who doesnt want to escape the one thing that worries and stresses them out the most? us guys just want to take care of our loved ones and families but when i feel there is nothing i can do i feel worthless and not up to the task a failure that can be destructive mental illness is not fair bipolar is not fair i would recommend returning to counselling and also for both of you to learn more on bipolar together i find going over literature together helps even repetitively as it refreshes what the illness is and what it does i constantly strain to separate the illness from the person good luck,0
im currently on the road to getting my ssd for my mental health i have severe general anxiety disorder plus bipolar disorder and depression along with leg problems good luck tho,1
please everyone just take one day at a time dont ever live in future ive learned just as this post says " who my real friends/family are "  live everyday like its your last i mean that in a very respectful and good way im still seeing who still there for me they drop like flies why because they dont understand what were fighting in our heads  for the most part with me i can only say its me my own demons inside its a fucking scary ass ride excuse my language no ones ever alone look for support groups seek new dr get a different dr and maybe the meds youre on are not for you keep trying and fighting the bell hasnt rung yet for any of us good luck and god bless #livelovelaugh,0

only in front of those that are very close to me not strong enough for anyone else to see me that vulnerable,1
the effexer hasnt been working for me so the doc is weaning me off of it and ive got terrible brain zap its almost debilitating and makes me super irritable and ill snap at people i work with and just start crying for no reason and get suicidal thoughts that wont go away i hope this medication works for you its extremely difficult coming off of it for me,1
awwwecome on guysgo easy on each other pleeeease people do not post on here to be berated by others & told to get on with iti too am currently not working because of it & its a damn struggle maybe sending love & good wishes to each other is what suffers need lots of love 2 you felicia ,0
zoe you need to see an intergrative or functional dr - theyre all about looking at the root cause not just symptoms my dr has patients who had severe depression (like me) psychosis debilitating anxiety etc & they all had one thing in common - hormonal and/or nutritional deficiencies i also have a gluten & dairy intolerance plus some issues with my gut health knowing these things & treating the root cause of these problems has changed my life! blessings ,1
i always acted happy and carefree but when i was diagnosed and went for therapy a whole lot of things fell into place a lot of things in my past just made sense i wish i had help when i was young but my mom who suffers of severe depression was to busy to notice i had a total burn out 7 years ago but my loving husband and son has been my rock but my doctors are amazing as well i have been with the same psychiatrist and psycologist all this time and they pull me through many times it took a while to get my meds right but it is fine now i still have manic episodes and have learned that it is okay to ask for help even if it is just a hug if family dont understand it is usually because they are scared that you will blame them get help go to good doctors and then sit and explain what you feel and go through i took my hubby to counselling with me a few times and it helped if you feel alone just check the page there is always someone with loving help and advise,0
i gained about 50 lbs with the zyprexa melt away it did help a little but the restless legs constipation and headachesalong with the weight gain made it not worth it to me its weight i cant get off too,1
its all manageable with dbt therapy but it takes a lot of effort on the patient and a lot of times closes family struggle to understand the illness that i struggle with every day if you are reading this and realize it sounds like you know you can fight it but it takes a lot of work,0
i understand what you mean but cant you keep a v basic contact with ur mum she did give birth to you of course you need to keep stress to a minimum but i think her life maybe sadder without contact from you all mothers miss their kids its just a suggestion but it wud be better than having regrets later and if u agree she ill then her comments prob stem from that i myself have a difficult relationship with my mum i try to keep basic contact,0
sometimes it takes lots of med changes to find the right combination stick with it eventually youll find a combo that works but it does sound like you may need ativan klonopin valium or xanax for the anxiety itselfbest of luck to youhang in there!!,1
super task focused extreme anger if interupted cant sleep road rageirrational irritation and agitation,1
it is so hard to deal with in my 40s and still have a difficult time it is like crack once it gets started if you are not in a committed relationship then have no shame you are who you are and adults can have sex with each other having a committed relationship and you stray that is the hard part you have to then decide if telling is only going to relieve your guilt or telling because they deserve to know,0
please seek medical help we only get 1 life  i suffer anxiety and depression since my hubbys suicide please dont be a statistic like he is ,1
me toostarted having delusions that everyone was against me and visions of murderous rage scary got off it after a week seems to work great for some though currently on lithium and ativan,1
i have talked to my dr about ect and i have as i said researched it - and roughly 60% of the information/cases im finding where people who have had it have actually reported how they are doing months/years afterwards have shown substantial long term effects from this treatment they report a euphoria type effect after treatments that can last maybe 6 months after which their depression goes back to how it was or its worse + they suffer deficits they never reported having before there is also evidence that hospitals/dr who administer this treatment do not keep records of following up with the patients whove completed their ect sessions longer than 60days approximate the risk factor for this treatment at least to me far far far outweighs any possible benefit,0
i am sometimes scared still even though ive never been to a psych ward i have all that you have i use to give myself panic attacks to the point i couldnt stay home alone it helps if you use lavender oils to breathe in for anxiety it also helps to talk to friends during the time you are scared im available to talk when you need a friend i beat the panic attacks but when my husband leaves sometimes its hard i also ended up getting a dog to help but if you need a friend add me and talk with me im here,0
bipolar can be extremely happy without worrying about being manic i can if youre lopsided on your meds and inclined to the depressive you need an adjustment from say anti depressants to mood stabilizers but i can assure you it is very easy to be happy and positive with bipolar,1
a strong man and a believer of christ never fear anyone he always rise when he fall,0
yes teens can be given medication i know in the states doctors do it as young as 2 it is not a bad thing to have to take medication the only downside is addiction to it or even depression that can follow i have severe anxiety and i have been on medication for years i would also seek out something to get his anxiety down while he sleeps its tough being on sleeping medication but with racing thoughts in your head will not go away therapy may also be a good thing to seek out you may want to try that first if it does not succeed then i would look to other alternatives also your mum could go to therapy to talk to someone about how she feels it is not a bad thing at all therapy can change the whole world to a person i wish you and your family the best good luck in finding the right answers because they are out there,1
what the hell does this have to do with depression/bipolar/anxiety?,1
for someone with your history that seems completely normal i have been cheated on i am also now with an amazing man yet i always feel insecure & talk about "if" we break up which upsets him i just feel like i need to get myself ready for it as the first time i was totally unprepared it ruined me i went through years of not knowing what was wrong with me i was diagnosed with bipolar 2 with ocd traits social anxiety disorder gad & seasonal affective disorder i take my meds & try to just concentrate on each day for me looking too far ahead overwhelmes me i was told by a doctor once that i need to think of my illness like i have diabetes i cant be cured but i need to maintain my condition i wish you all the best & respect you for putting yourself out there sending lots of love your way ,0

xanthrid kalos it was awful! i thought the casting was dreadful that sooooo didnt look like larten crepsley! darren & steve were awful too! i asked darren shan at the last book signing & tour he did in edinburgh (back there 27th aug to see him) what he thought of it & he said "it might not have been the way he had envisioned it turning out however it brought him a whole new bands of fans because older fans were totally trashing it (quite rightly so) & saying the books were soooo much better (which they were) and that encouraged people who hadnt read one of his books to read them" i think if the were ever to do that or demonata or saga of larten crepsley it would need to be like a netflix mini series if you know what i mean? vancha march rocks and even in death may you be triumphant ,0

idk if anyone else has mentioned this but i stress to everyone if its urgent go to the hospital and there also hospital programs that are outpatient programs in certain places its not just inpatient that is offered so look up the closest mental hospital also in those that are bipolar antidepressants can cause mania and fluoxetine is one also it has been shown to cause rapid cycling in bipolar patients it also may affect adversely the development of the brain in young people as far as the hallucinations psychosis can be part of bipolar but not bipolar 2,1
absolutely true for me i hate it if had just one wish it would be to take my anxiety away,1
if anything she can have mine and all my problems all she mainly has is anxiety and depression i have bipolar i major depression and insomnia it pisses me off she would wonder around telling people she has it just so they pity her,1

i dont know if i have bipolar 2 but i have been struggling with depression and low self-esteem for a long time depression and anger cost me a job i only had for two weeks back in 2014,1
first i think its important that you realize you are not alone you are not a burden your boss is ignorant because if he knew a damn thing about being mentally ill he wouldnt of ever said any of those things self harm is one of those things that only you can change its important to know you already have the power inside you to stop (btw i have over five severe mental illnesses and no one even knows bc i hide it so well so all this is coming from experience) you are a lot stronger than people give you credit for you are smart and deserve to be proud of yourself for reaching out for help therapists are a great idea and resource for people like us there are usually income based therapists in every location (in my state theyre called north key) but you can google it be strong keep pushing pray god has a plan for your pain he will turn your pain into progress when it rains look for rainbows when its dark look for stars dont let any one scare you away from god he is not what people make him out to be he loves you for who you are right where you are stay resilient things will eventually get better,0
i have bipolar 1 my bf of 15 years since we met has a hard time wants me to do more  on my good days i can do half of what i used to i often grieve for my old self but w several diagnosis i have to come to grips w this awful illness  its something you cant explain we been to many drs and it seems the older people are just dont get it at all  they think im lazy mean even faking it  im glad for this site the more its talked about more awareness comes everyday is a struggle ,0
i have severe driving anxiety as well i take only buspirone for anxiety and so far it hasnt touched it at least i know im not the only one out there with driving anxiety,1
this is how i used to feel! i thank god that these horrible times are shorter now i believe growing older and having more insight into my bi-polar disorder and my severe anxiety and depression has helped me immensely as well as living with a very kind supportive individual who believes in me!,1
whenever someone tells me they got off meds and change their diet use essential oils and exercise first i wonder are you bipolar because if you are youre manic and get help sick people never know theyre sick until its too late the psychosis anxiety suicidal ideation and general delusions i dealt with when i was truly sick and everyone saw but i thought i was fine were truly life threatening i thought everyone else was nuts thinking something was wrong with me bipolar episodes are no joke chemical imbalances get fixed with chemicals! theres a little science for you,0
lily josh jasy yes my doctor who has been managing my anxiety for the last 5 years said it usually goes either of two ways for people- calms them and makes them sleepy (but put on weight) or gives them heaps of energy and loose weight) even though i have had weight gain the positives out way that for me xx,0
sorry but thats not true theres a lot of people who; could be with the perfect partner and not feel good enough because of their own strugglesim one of those people that regardless i feel im never good enough being in a relationship doesnt "magically change that" however if you only doubt yourself when with someone and rarely ever do then yeah they arent good enough,0
yes kevin we have to take it but im frightened what side effects they cause xx,0
so true! last night i had a severe panic attack where i literally thought i was dying most people dont know how to deal in those situations my mom jumped in and helped me calm down and she seemed to just know how to be there for me those people are treasures in our lives,0
me all the time its beginning to scare me,0
i think deep down many of us afflicted already know we are the gifted allowed to access parts of our brains housing telepathy and other 6th sense awareness capabilities and that is why many of us war with depression and anxiety we share in the glory and agony of others who have the luxury of only being aware of themselves our true design and purpose in a less increasingly and overwhelmingly selfish world is to help others understand themselves and how their "vibes" are affecting the world around them,1
if hes up & down all the time it can make ur moods go like that i was married for 19 yrs & my ex husband had me & the kids walking on egg shells all the time plus my childhood my dad was vioent to my mother including drugs an alcohol both those times in my life left me with depression & severe anxiety being around toxic people can bring u down i hope things get better but if his not willing to get help u should think about leaving him my ex done same thing said same things about my friends since i left him iv been able to be myself happy for once ,0
yes its an uncomfortable feeling and i feel intense confusion ,0
copy and pasted from a page hope it helps in regards to bipolar: bipolar is a complex mental health disorder its most common forms are bipolar i (mania and depression) and bipolar ii (hypomania and depression) however other forms do exist due to the cyclic nature of this disorder it is often times difficult to treat and because of society’s stigmatization of the disorder those who are suffering from bipolar often times feel embarrassed or ashamed leading to them not getting the help they need bipolar i is the most common form of bipolar that society talks about it is characterized by a cycle of really high highs and really low lows individuals with this type of bipolar may experience a period of “normal” mood in between mood swings during which their mood and energy level feels “right” and their ability to function is not disturbed during the high periods symptoms can include taking on too many activities at once spending money in ways that cause trouble becoming more talkative outgoing or sexual and consumption or increased consumption of alcohol and/or drugs these symptoms may lead to others perceiving the sufferer as strange or annoying and can cause trouble with co-workers or authority figures during the low periods sufferers often feel a lack of energy a need to stay in bed or get extra sleep and little or no motivation to do things they need to do they often put on weight during these periods and feel sad or depressed all the time sometimes during the low phases they may feel helpless or even suicidal their ability to function at work or socially can become impaired (bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale) bipolar ii is characterized by hypomania meaning a slight increase in mood followed by depression hypomanic episodes are defined by feeling incredibly productive and happy sufferers may see themselves as being in a high functioning mode and feel that there is nothing wrong during these periods the depressive episodes are defined by a prolonged period (at least two weeks) of feelings of sadness hopelessness and disinterest in taking part in life during these low phases sufferers often feel fatigued restless agitated unfocused indecisive and in some cases suicidal (bipolar spectrum diagnostic scale) because bipolar involves both highs and lows it can be difficult to treat if someone stays manic their physician will focus on bringing their mood down to a healthier happy this however can be difficult to accomplish as many people who suffer from mania enjoy the extra energy creativity and intensity that comes with it likewise it can be difficult to treat the depression that comes with bipolar because the medications used to treat the depression can unfortunately cause a manic episode it is also not uncommon for bipolar medications to stop working overtime causing an individual who was once stable on medication to cycle and have to start the search for an effective medication over again lastly some of the medications used to treat bipolar are known for causing side effects in some people knowing this keeps some people from trying medications that might actually help them from my 14 years working with an adult psychiatrist and my 9 years as a licensed counselor i can attest to the stigma many individuals suffering from bipolar struggle with society has wrongly blamed bipolar disorder for causing people to commit horrific acts such as assault and murder society has also misused the term in a negative sense to describe people they do not like strange weather mechanical issues with their car etc; the list goes on these derogatory and inaccurate associations keep people from seeking help because they fear being diagnosed with bipolar and then being labeled as “crazy” and “dangerous” by their family and friends when i have a client that has received an official diagnosis of bipolar from a doctor one of the first things i often have to do is work with them to see and accept that society is wrong that they are truly not crazy or dangerous i then have to help them work through their fear of being out casted by everyone in their lives so that they can tell their mom or dad or best friend about their diagnosis and what they are going through overall bipolar can be one of the hardest mental health disorders to suffer from it can present differently from person to person but it always has a component of fluctuating moods the best thing someone suffering from bipolar can do is think about how wrong society is about most things and then remind themselves that society is wrong about bipolar too heather n smith med licensed professional counselor supervisor,1
i hope and pray you get the needed help so you may feel whole again i have a friends son that is currently reaching out that is feeling hopeless! i took him in to my home long enough to where he did seek help and is now feeling better! nothing to be ashamed of we have all been to the bottom of the pit at times you are going forward with what you need to do for yourself be proud of that never make permanent decision on a temporary thought someone out there needs you ty for aharing,0

nah i dont want to die by suicide the last thing id want is someone making bad remarks they never put good makeup on you when you die its always the cheapest makeup then they embalm you and make your boobs stick out like dolly parton and looking like a vampire even though i love vampires just isnt my style its never the expensive makeup its always the hot pink or bright pink lipstick and boy they pack on the blush its always the hot pink blush i dont know about you but they have awful tastes in makeup for the dead why should we care about makeup? i dont want to look like a hooker (apologies to hookers) in a coffin look were all in debt but that isnt a good enough reason to kill yourself hey wave your pills if youre in student loan debt (waves pills)! and no parent thinks of their child as a burden i love to argue with my kids (even if they think they know-it-all) i still love my babies even when theyre 100 you have to form a bucket list of what you want to do in life its time to start living i just exfoliated with a charcoal sugar mask and my face feels tight i want to go to athens greece ive never been i want to see the mediterranean sea i dont know why i just want to see it so youre in debt we all have debts lawd i think my face will freeze and ill look like janice dickinson make a list on things you want to live for and do it even if youre in debt it isnt the end of the world you may think it is but debt isnt something to worry about i wish i could ((hug)) you in person so you have to settle for this pathetic web ((hug)) thats the best i can do youve just been hugged how do you like them apples?,0

going inpatient can be a really good thing im not ashamed to say i have checked myself in several times if nothing else it gives a break from the day to day building of the "real world" 3 days rest from everything can give you the chance to recharge and refuel,0
austin: ive been working with my doctor and it took almost a year and a half of trying to figure out what works best with my chemical make up (because everybody is different and the same regiment that works for me might not work for you) we have found that a mood stabilizer daily and a stimulate when needed helps me to manage my daily life without falling into an emotional pit of despair while we were trying to figure out what works best for me we tried a medication that caused visual hallucinations but i contacted him and he imminently discontinued that medication and got me in the same week to make sure i was alright its important to note that although that was not a pleasant experience i didnt give up hope because i reminded myself that the goal was to get better and only rarely when trying to figure out the best way to do something is it ever gotten right on the first try even when i started taking the medication that im using today i had to deal with stomach discomfort (constipation / weight gain) but i counter acted those side effects by changing my diet and forcing myself to start exercising a funny thing about that is that i started taking a natural probiotic (extremely healthy and all natural) supplement to help with the constipation and for the first week i felt like i had to use the restroom all the time even when i didnt have any stool to dispose of one thing to keep in mind is the fact that youre going to feel different but thats the point some side effects can be a sign that youre on the wrong medication but other side effects can be manageable as long as youre willing to put in the work ive been working with my doctor and for the past five years ive been on a regiment that helps me and havent had to suffer any of the side effects that came with not taking the medications such as hospitalization / self harm / suicidal thoughts i hope that answered your question and sorry if it was a bit long winded but im working on a book at the moment so i get into writing and its difficult to stop,1
i second beth- i would not go to the appointment asking for specific meds- i would talk to them about the symptoms you are experiencing and how they are affecting your life and ability to work and get along with family benzos are a big deal- they are incredibly addictive- yes you feel better taking them but you will need more and more to get the same effect and that leads to addiction- please if the doctor declines to prescribe them do not feel they do not care about you- they are expressing care not prescribing them i love the effect of klonopin but have decided they are just too dangerous for me to be taking as i abuse them- i do not wish to take an overdose due to not being able to keep track of my dosage i am on a non addictive medicine called buspar for anxiety so there are other options besides benzos,0
im catholic and i never heard such nonsense yeah you can pray for strength to fight your struggles but not to "cure" yourself or "get over it" wtfpeople should be helping you grow in faith and support you thru hard times instead of demonizing youfind a new church!!,0
i have bipolar 2 and i didnt feel a big change until i started taking lithium i still take about 6 or 7 different medicines in addition to that and they all work together to give me the best results possible i did get lithium poisoning once which was horrible but the doctor just lowered my dosage and i was fine i go for blood tests every few months to check lithium levels i really started feeling like a person once i started the lithium,1
being a partner to someone who has a mental illness must be so hard but the things you describe are true and honest triggers for me its never an excuse its a monster living in his head ive been in relationships where i was treated bad because of my bipolar and anxiety now im married to the most calm and loving man that never makes me feel worse when im having an episode or being triggered by something that seems "ridiculous" im not trying to be shitty but just because you work in mental health doesnt mean youre equipped to live with it at home he just needs your love and acceptance not blame and anger,0
its definitely a struggle that other ppl will never understand,0

melanie renee im struggling here lately and heres to hoping you are getting through okay!!!,0
hello jay settle down if you can you sound a bit panicked how can we make this depression not as bad as the last? the first thing ill share is have what you have and im on mood stabilizers lithium and zonisamide at night these level me out and i get extra rest with an atypical anti psychotic ziprasidone in daytime i get up and get 64 colors more like 128 get a canvas with a pre-made drawing on it from hobby lobby and i imagine my depression and i pick colors reflecting it and i then try to depict what depression feels like trust me if youre coloring you cant go lower its melodic and clears your brain and doesnt allow any bullshit in i did this for five days straight and i walked away from the cliff colored in five canvases and got sleep and took my meds,1
im sorry to hear what you are both going through i take sertraline and venlafaxine to combat my illness and on whole they work but i do get periods of darkness as someone who has battled depression and anxiety for over 25 years i have started to try and occupy my mind does he have anything that he enjoys doing? i have found photography a good outlet and also music im terrible but ive started to teach myself the guitar it helps me i wish you all the best ☺,1
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page thank you hun hugs peace ✌️,1
im sorry but we are incurable they truly understand so little about the mind ive lived with it for 40 years and it is manageable with therapy and right meds bipolar comes with so many side "orders" anxiety ptsd sleeplessness personality disorders,1
ignore them you are the one living with it took me 10 years to get here i was ashamed i had bp and i tried to hide it from others did me no good look in the mirror and say im beautiful and i have a disease that does not define me than live your life trying to stay in remission,0
medication is likely going to be necessary its ok come to terms with that you will probably feel so much better and managing your illness will be far less stressful ;),0
i take klonopin 1mg during the day and 1mg at night  im also on seroquel xr for bipolar 2 now the seroquel xr is nothing like reg seroquel its a godsend and my anxiety has calmed down significant klonopin is longer lasting than xanax and doesnt hit you as hard  hope this helps,1
do you suffer from an anxiety disorder? i ask because if it a social thing then just remember to breathe and believe that yourself is good enough if you get panic attacks and such then u may want a low dose of an anxiety med but talk to your doctor about it if you have one and make sure not to mix with alcohol im always preached i suffer from anxiety and take 1mg of klonopin (i believe thats a low dose) good luck,1
i was so scared to see my new pschy doc i cried when he walked into the room he was so nice & comforting he spent a lot of time answering all my questions i write down all my questions on a sheet & give it to him then he goes through them one by one now i love my monthly appointments & my husband always comes in with me good luck,0
full disclosure: i have been living with bipolar 1 disorder (diagnosed) since i was 15 years old i had my first manic episode when i was 12 i will be 44 in may i have been on and off medications currently on them: 1200 mg of lithium and 150 mg of trazodone for almost six years in my 30 years i have self medicated in the past with booze and drugs promiscuous sex stealing driving and behaving out of control thats just the tip of my mania iceberg after a heightened state of mania that (for me) can last months i have debilitating crashing lows that send me to my bedroom and pajamas for weeks at a time i am extremely fortunate to have an amazing support group in my life that dont let me linger long in either state i still deal with mania (especially when im excited about something) and depression (not as much these days but i still have a day or two once a month where im in a funk) medication is not a be all end all but it does make my life possible side effects of my meds can be troublesome but they are a lot more agreeable than the hell i live through without my meds i have amazing relationships with my family and friends (no exaggeration here--i am a lucky woman on this front) a full-time job that i love and am excited to get up for five days a week and volunteer work that fills my heart and spirit i have struggled to get to where i am today but it is possible to have a fulfilling and functional life with mental illness,0
i take my meds at the same times every day so i just set alarms on my cell phone to remind me,1
i think when people are too mentally ill to function or even get out of bed the statement of "put your big girl panties on can be a very damaging statement yes we are all sick here yes its all different degrees weve been told our whole lives to quote "suck it up" and it its a very deep cord for some of us and can seem extremely insensitive always be aware that you never know what other peoples struggles are,0
yes but most of the time my chronic pain affects my mental health because i get even more depressed because i cant do as much as id like but the more tense i feel from anxiety the more flares i have it goes both ways,0
yes put yourself first i know this is hard but my brother got me this book that was titled"dont sweat the small stuffand its all small stuff" mind you my sister nlaw told me after my brother killed himself this past september 22there is 10 months and 3 days between both suicides my dad was my abuserand my brother only months before told me he knew why my dad did to me(a blessing) since i carried the nightmare since i was young and now i 50 it was hard to tell myself its all small stuff after i was the last to talk to my brother before he killed himselfbut he was sick and he isnt suffering with esphogaus and stomach cancerwhich he got from being in the marines/ camp lagune nc drinking contaminated water the whole military base waslife is really hard for most of us out there and you have to take time for yourselfto healwhat you are troubled about hopefully you will find some peace hopefully you have a friend you can talk todo you have an animal who needs you and can give you some unconditional love i have too tried many times to kill myself but we have unfinished business if the father doesnt take us i can say a dog can be real medicine when we are strugglingdont give up and im not a cat person but there are so many critters who need a home and they never leave us when we are in need just know others struggle and we need to support each other when possible,0
i struggle with this so much and im bipolar,0
i agree this is something that no one talks about because you get called names what people dont understand is that its really a sickness and an overwhelming addiction it ruined my first marriagepraise jesus he helped me through it ive been a faithful wife for 5 years on my second marriage ❤️,0
i have bi polar anxiety and panic attacks i have bad bad highs and lows it may not seem possible but something ive come to realise is that this is the last time i read the comments because they make my lows even worse,1
i dont know how old you are but your dx changes as you get up there i have so many issues but the dire ones complete anxiety or disassiotion depression crippling as it is your left with so many issues but luckily the panic and deep depression seems to let up but seriously you need a dr to give much needed meds (i cant stress this) someone needs to look out of the box everyone you know is in the house im medicated which such a dx is a must because of chemical imbalance but i was raped tortured by my brother and 1st husband i had a twin sister who killed herself leaveing me to raise her twin babies what im getting at you can get though anything just try really try to look out of the box you have a life there too,1
go back to the hospital seems like everyone is focused on their well being you should do the same its not being selfish or anything of that nature but how do they expect you to tend to your mom if youre unstable how do you think that youre able to so? my family puts pressure on me knowing im not doing very well almost like they tend to forget at times i honestly feel they dont care about anything but what they need or want and then i end up relapsing i have learned how to distance myself from those type people to prevent having any setbacks every situation is different but if youre feeling that bad i pray you find it in you to go seek help immediately!!! god bless you and i hope all turns out well!,0
you are worth living i am so happy that youre at the psych ward that you definitely need to be there honey just to get things in perspective but you can do this we just have to find the right counselor to help you get through it and please dont hesitate to post in this group im really happy you that youre there and you made it and youre going to get through this,0
it is even more difficult when you have physical illnesses and you get even more depressed it truly becomes an ugly vicious circle of pain all over i suffer get tired of the fight but i refuse to let my illnesses have the last word i will not allow my pain to win!!! we are all praying and waiting for cures i know how hard it is when you only get an hour or 2 sleep in a week i wish you all the best in your struggles love and prayers! warrior on!,0
sewage baby dreadfulbut i dont know what i was expecting really!,0
yep!!! been with my man for 2 years and just today i think my fears have been somewhat settled my biggest fear was never being loved because of my brain hes saw some dark things inside of me,0
easier said then done but its alot less struggle to just let it go then to try and carry the torch which may never be relit try to get a solid network of friends and maybe at times ponder what couldve been but trying to live in that past is a dangerous blanket so familiar yet so cold moving forward is what life is experiences moments and those who stayed til the end so keep your head up and stop blaming yourself as if your the one who caused the separation and try to look at it for what it is two people grown apart and no amount of tape can change what it is,0
i am a christian i attended a pentecostal church for about 6 months the preachers wife who did most of the preaching on wednesday nights for whatever reason said during a sermon pretty much that adhd and bipolar didnt exist her nephew had been "acting up" and was diagnosed with adhd so i caught her after the sermon and asked her how she can say something like that when there are scientific brain scans that can be done to show the physical difference between someone with a normal brain as opposed to someone with bipolar i mean i get her not believing her nephew had adhd because he was only 6 or so but to blatantly say bipolar didnt exist rubbed me the wrong way her response was they have has several people in the congregation that were bipolar and that through prayer they were healed i looked at her and said well then they never had it to begin with and walked out i never went back i know have been attending a different church for over a year and the pastor knows im bipolar and he knows that there is science involved in order to keep me stabilized because my pastor is a rational thinking man he doesnt try to convince anyone with any disabilities that simply praying will make it go away he prays for and with us when we struggle but he understands it wont just go away,0
please get help hon there is no shame in seeking help i agree stay away from judgemental people and those that know nothing about mental illness,1
hey guys im the one that ask this to be posted :( nervous but i didnt know it was a real thing and they want me to take celexa but i also have a fear of taking medication so its been on my counter for the last year :(,1
depression and anxiety it usually helps my son is bipolar has depression and anxiety and hes never been anything but okay or not good on his meds i just wish they could get the right combination,1
its a very deep dark hole that i so desperately want to get out of to see the sunlight but cant reach the top and no ppl that dont have it dont understand even if they try,0
was on prozac but it was horrible !!!! love my son not pregnancy also b safe with everyone knowing ur issues my son doesnt live with me bcuz judge said no fixing crazy yeah,0
yes and it was absolutely horrible changed doctors who then changed my meds afta awhile and now im on an even keel,1
i get all of these other than the sex 1 but not been tested for bipolar or anything other than depression and anxiety,1
i hate bad grammar as much as i hate medications for free-floating anxiety (gad),1
i love the compassion ive read here in a world full of negative and unsettling this is great to read,0
prayers for you ive been saying a prayer called deliverance sometimes it helps me calms my mind if you want to try that pm me no pressure ((hugs)),0
it made me more depressed nauseated and restless legs real bad they switched me to celexa ive been on it 6 years now no problems i hope it works for you,1
yup i had aasked my boyfriend the other day if he was getting tired of me my anxiety causes me to over think i wish it would let me be but no anxiety comes over and whispers in my ear im also afraid of losing him i love him so much,0
i do that honestly give her time to calm down sometimes it will be one or two days for me i dont want to talk or anything i get in an argument or stress or something and it makes me just shut down,0
its helped me with the depression of my bipolar but gave me terrible headaches and did nothing for my anxiety,1
make a list each day of things you need to get done and check them off when you wake you can see whats left to do just a bit of organization and youll get the reality check you need to bring down your anxiety,1
made my anxiety worse tbh,1
this is so needed for students and parents the reason i say parents also is because my 12 year old daughter was diagnosed with anxiety depression and and she was cutting herself i found this out through the school consular thank heavens for her but one of my daughters friends mothers found out and her daughter is not allowed to be friends with my daughter anymore this hurt my daughter very much i think parents need to be educated about mental illness and realize that it is not contagious,1
im pushing my bf away i dont mean to today im going to tell him whats going on and what ive been thinking cause it has ruined my relationships in the past i love my bf a lot and dont want to lose him over my anxiety im tired of it trying to rule my life,0
breathing exercises when you become overwhelmed with anxiety your breathing can become more rapid and if you can control it/slow it you will find yourself calming down some practice visualization to help fool your brain when you become overwhelmed with a situation example: anxious on public transportation while going to work you visualise yourself where ever you feel calm and with practice you can maintain that image easier,1
i cant fully relate however i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and after a year of being on the same meds they stopped working because i didnt coordinate them with counselling which is apparently what i was supposed to do my meds are switched now and i feel great again and now i am doing counselling so i hope i can stay on the same ones this time my point being after being on the same meds for a year theyre may have lost thier effects,1
still battling doctorstherapistspsychiatristsmedsnever ending it seems and my 8 yr old picked up slight anxiety from me and i feel horriblenow hes in counseling too helping him now so he doesnt turn out like me ,1
fear and loathing in las vegas???,0
did you ask your doctor if its a possibility that you may have borderline personality disorder with your mood swings being what they are? because i find when i was diagnosed with bipolar and they put me on medicine for it it didnt totally work i also was diagnosed with add anxiety ptsd ive now been told by my current psychiatrist that he thinks my diagnosis should be or added to of borderline personality disorder and suggest that i use dbt skills to help with my mood stabilization maybe this type of therapy can help you too,1
im not sure how people survive i just got laid off from work so im really struggling right now to much time in my head and i its not good maybye some social programs can help you with legal help,0
if you have never experienced anxiety - you will never "get it",0
do you keep a mood journal? it can be a great way of keeping track and you may be able to avoid those bad situations you mentioned i know a great thing to stop me from spending all my money into put my credit card into a bucket of water into the freezer you have to wait for the ice to melt before you can use it and by that time the urge may have stopped i hope you can weather this episode try and sleep if you can take care,1
severe depression anxiety general and panic and bipolar depending on which doctor,1
hang in there when a guy i loved rejected me i was shattered he had made me sign up for okcupid to see how compatible we were we were a good match but he walked away im glad he did because several months later my now husband started to chat to me yes life is a fight and you will struggle but you are not alone and there are amazingly good things and amazing people who are waiting for you so hang in there and fight because in the end it will be worth it,0
yes and its embarrassing,0
i took latuda and buspar with my last pregnancy for bi-polar and anxiety latuda worked great but after i had my baby i started having a reaction to it this is my 2nd pregnancy and am only on buspar the other med lamictal which is okay for pregnancy i have a reaction to as well i do go to group 3 times a weel as well good luck,1

its the meds well known as they cause uncontrollable eating apparently they trick the brain into thinking you have not eaten,1
loud tv gives me huge anxiety especially when the ads come on and someone tries to talk as well it caused so much stress i hardly ever have it on its like my brain cant cope with it,1
you just have to find one that works for you i tried 4 for my anxiety til i found one that worked,1
funny white chicks scary freddie deffo,0

horribleawful withdrawal if you have to go off of it,0
what if youre too afraid to be in public?,0
just because society has told us that mental illness is a horrible life does not mean it is a death sentence nor should we embrace the labels i hate having to wear my mask but i am striving to become stronger so that i can take it off i am who i am i am not my mental illness,0
guess what got me out of rapid cyclingas not to sound religious as im notbut i talked to a higher power and expressed all of my moods to that power i asked for help i spent most of my day just talking to the higher power expressing crying sharingit was like a light switch that changed thingsim actually able to have a job now and work whereas before i was too emotional to worktoday i am seen as the reliable one at workthe go to girl through talking to something or someone bigger than mea higher forcewhatever you want to call itnot medsnot reading some religious book but honestly just giving all of my fears hopes and dreams to god goddess whatevertry it you have nothing to lose im bipolar type 1 and guess whatall my anxiety and instability has disappearedmost of it anywaythere is a cosmic awesome energy force that is able to help you call on it,1
i am 55 years old and both my children have high functioning depression i have thirteen siblings we suspect at least two have bi polar or depression we have lost contact with them my 12 year old neice has depression and anxiety,1
im afraid nervous and aghhhgg !! i have many what ifs,0
i know someone who takes it and struggles not to sleep all day been that way for 6+mo,0
i have had a terrible day today couldnt get out of bed extremely depressed and no desire to do anything very painful anxiety and depression drs dont seem to know how painful this can be,1
i love you and i know it just worries me sometimes,0
yes ive lost people really important to me due to hypersexuality they cant understand how that person is not who i am; how i cant control it or how ashamed i get of my actions,0
ive always had the worst side effects with any of the anti depressants ive been on the worst being suicidality and ive tried them all my doctor has told me if i wanted to try any more i would need to do it as an inpatient in the psychiatric ward something im not keen on as for remembering to take medication if you set an alarm and have it at the same time every day eventually your body will trigger its own alarm good luck and sending you lots of healing energy ,0
mindfulness is a godsend for me to help dealing with my anxiety and anger there are plenty of resources on the net explaining what it is and what to do there are even apps for your phone dont get too caught up on a diagnosis keep a mood journal so when you can see another dr you can show them to help diagnosis take care,1
i was so glad to read that you were able to get some help! it is so hard for many of us to reach out and say we need help those who dont have bpd have a hard time understanding how our brain is wired and how our perceptions can get in the way i am so grateful you were able to find a group that you could relate to and then individuals that you could connect with! we need those things in our lives it helps me so much to be able to talk to all of you here! i am struggling right now and feel very much alone,0
i have depression and anxiety and it ruined my life,1
totally use to having extream anxiety with depression and being manic non stop glade i dont have a tail  im always forgetting what im doing and going in circles feels like lol,0
i took it for high blood pressure it made me sweat profusely i would sweat just sitting i finally told my doctor i didnt want to take it anymore,1
it happens covertly to me all the time "normal" people say suicide is cowardly while they themselves are cowards in their terrors of the brave and unique individuals that we are,0
i use busparone for anxiety and it stops the cycling thoughts too taking benzodiazapines like valium xanax etc just sets you up to fail you will continue to need larger and larger doses over time those medications are addictive most psychs where i live wont prescribe them any more busparone has been a wonder drug for me i take 15mg twice a day at night i also take seroquel for sleep also but if i dont go to sleep right away for some reason i have visions and lose all of my ability to judge distance and cant walk around or ill fall it helps me pretty fast though,1
im sorry its the things that bother us even though we feel like they shouldnt keeping a very detailed journal for your therapist will help more than anything its so hard to say what you want to in the short time you get it is a difficult challenge to do and when it happens the distress makes it hard to write or remember keep something on you at all times to document i wish you the best,0
sounds to me like you have weighed your options and know what is best for you also you have a support system with your boss and friends and that is going to be key during this time dont listen to the feelings when you are alone and scared just remember that you are growing and you are changing and you dont want the life you have lived to happen again and you know in your heart of hearts that if you stay it will get that way again go you have a life to lead and live i will be praying for you and i know with your support system you can make it,0
careful with the abilify can cause ramdom sudden fainting was on it for a long time before it happened the first time scary as hell,1
thank you for posting this question i have a bipolar disorder depression and anxiety im 28 and finding it hard to date let alone just being around people in general the guy im currently seeing doesnt understand why at times i need the constant validation that we are in a good place or that at times i become too clingy my poor mind just feels broken,0
my daily struggle,0
i stated taking cymbalta last month and they started me at 60 mg i got really bad shakes in my hands for a bout 4 days then started sweating profusely! i want to change it but people tell me to give it a shot! i hate the sweating part and it helps me sleep and my appetite isnt like it was either!,1
i thought this was supposed to be a place to come for support telling a person who is already struggling in a deep amount of pain that "no one cares" is even more hurtful and triggering sounds like some people are stuck in their own dysfunction projecting it onto others and dont know the skill of when to be quiet,0
funny-- the american pie movieshorror-- jennifers body,0
set your alarm,0
dont be afraidyou will be helped to become well again,1
norine delong jarrell it does work getting back in touch with your senses individually and focusing on these can be a good distraction from a panic attack what has always helped me is just remembering this too shall pass its all in my head deep breaths  slowly in and then out and it goes away eventually taking the deep breaths and slowing down your heart rate truly helps though ,1
sometimes it is a big voice using all your insecurities against you,1
find a plan that works for youbaby steps can be milestones walk a bit further ever day go somewhere every day it can be a vicious circlewe get panicked and then more frightened to go the next time believe in yourself hoping you have a therapist to help you friends/family who help and support you and big arms to give yourself a hug,0
i would talk to your psychiatrist i was really struggling with my bipolar depression and my meds were not really helping me i was feeling like you after consulting my psychiatrist i decided to give ect a try it seems pretty extreme but ultra brief ect has turned my life around i feel so much better there is also tms which is working wonders for lots of people i know,0
it represents the chemical symbol for seratonin it is the neurotransmitter that helps control feelings mood and happiness it directly influences depression sadness and anxiety it reminds us that we can make our own happiness,1
unless you are unlucky and get the high blood pressure,1
do you have a closed group? im not worried about talking openly but ive noticed you get quite a few anonymous questions in which people may benefit from also having a group thats closed so that we can ask better questions about their situation to respond without guessing unk parts if you do id like to join (or if you start one) i believe with closed groups friends and family cant see what groups theyre following or the conversations thanks,0
no i have never tried it but id love to know if it works for you i am suffering with no medication and desperately looking for a support group here in tampa so if anyone knows of a doctor or specialist i can see on a sliding scale maybe? i dont have insurance so any advice would be helpfultyty :d,0
society shapes your thoughts and perceptions as to what is acceptable and what is not we eat it all up like a parasite then it manifests itself in mental disorders bc the brain and our emotions are overwhelmed so yes society do you boo,1
they would be very concerned and frightened and surprised that my thoughts are so dark and negative and deep and deppresing,0
in a world that teaches you self doubt liking yourself is a rebellious actgo on do it like yourself you need to be on your own sideif you think others dont like you the least you can do is like yourself! please! learn to adore who you areyou of all people should love yourself more than anyone else loves you rebel you can!,0
not sure what meds youre on but you do need an anti psychotic to stop the paranoia and high anxiety its the only base type of drug that works,1
go have fun its a great way to combat the anxiety by facing it,1
actually how you were raised has nothing to do with any of that some people had horrible parents and are good people some people have good loving parents and are bad people adults think for themselves and make their own decisions,0
yes i use seroquil its works for anxiety its not a sleep drug but a side affect is drowsiness i love it,1
the way my mental health nurse explained it to me having bpd is like bp but its having a months worth of ups downs and switch feeling is 1 day which is why it is so dangerous but treatment is very similar i was misdiagnoses with bp for years and i kept saying they were wrong now i have a real diagnosis and they can see why i struggle in a day as i dont no how i feel from 1 min to the next people dont no enough about bpd and i have been treated aporlingly by medical professionals sick of judgment now i have a supportive mental health team and i finally think i have a chance to get better not just for me but my children,0
all of these tattoos are amazing i love this page and to see that i am not as alone as it feels at times i have been trying to figure out something to do to represent my own struggles as i was diagnosed with bi polar disorder at 14 and have struggled with it and other mental health issues since 12 years old (25 now) these all are beautiful and so insuring i never knew there were so many symbols for mental health until i came across pages like this one,0
dying is no longer a fear as long as it is quick,0
im am currently off all my meds ill get back on them if i need to but ive been using vitamins and supplements and i also recently moved to co where pot is legal and i have found a couple strains that help my anxiety its new to me but i hate meds (and yes i know thats part of bipolar) but i have other health issues and it isnt smart for me to be on 20 different pills every day that do affect my liver and kidneys very badly i will say i always end up back in them when or if i have a bad manic episie but so far im keeping that under control by making myself eat and sleep that seems to break up a manic cycle take it if you need to but if you can manage without it i personally feel like thats a better way to go if you can handle it all,1
amanda any baby can show those signs as each and every baby is as singular and individual as adults are research the hell out of the subject speak to multiple doctors specialists and make sure that you see a psychiatrist as opposed to a psychologist regarding medications - they are the ones who are trained in that area make sure that you know what can happen what a "safe" dose during pregnancy is and how to handle/what to do if your baby does have withdrawals etc though realistically if your baby is having withdrawals he/she will be staying in the hospital so that it can be managed in a safe and non-life threatening way just because someone else who has taken didnt have any issues it doesnt mean that you wont and vice versa only you know what is best for you and your baby however if you are having suicidal thoughts i would be inclined to stay on the zoloft and to increase as your psych deems fit you will have a whole team of doctors psych obgyns and perinatal/postnatal specialists looking after both you and your baby (pre and post birth) to ensure both of your safety and needs are taken care of have an in-depth discussion with your psych - write out any and all questions that you have before your next appointment and take that list with you so that you may address your concerns properly good luck sweetheart! ❤️xxx,1
i know exactly how you feel i would never give advice or offer hope as i am conscious that every sufferer is unique just wanted to share that after mis-read medication i am now 3 weeks back on medication i have used before - citalaprim - and it appears to be working for me again and lifted my mood enough to be able to get up face the day and do things and laugh i hope your fog clears even a little if not on any meds or if you are and they are not working go back to your gp also sleep/ insomnia/anxiety meditations by lina grace have helped me a great deal as well as other insights on youtube - andrew solomon on ted talks talking about depression others too the loneliness  or sense of it of the experience even if we have partners beside us is i found one of the hardest symptoms look for and seek the moments of respite however short there is hope in them and in drawing them out to longer experiences do what makes you smile relax switch off distract you from your dark thoughts - e en if writing on this fb page i have started writing every day even if only a couple of sentences - my autobiography- which will never be published thoughts with you,1

taking what youve posted on this thread already should give your dr or therapist enough information to be able to begin a treatment plan to help you overcome your fears of being alone do you think you could possibly have a deep seated fear of abandonment? that was a disorder i had to deal with because of issues that stemmed from my childhood when my parents divorced no matter which one of them was taking care of methe other one was absent in my lifethis was what set me up to feel abandoned when i was left alone in my adult life with the right treatment plan medication & learning how to cope i was able to overcome those desperate feelings of abandonment,0
the struggle is real i k ow all too well,0

the head of page starts with bi polar it doesnt really matter anyway people that struggle with any mental issues find good help and encouragement bi polar is associated with many mental issues,0
withdraws from cymbaltaba were horrid i had to go into the hospital for 2weeks until physical symptoms were relieved a bit but it took months before mental symptoms started to clear i would much rather have withdrawn from an opiate,1

i struggle with rapid cycling bipolar disorder post tramatic stress disorder body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety and i havent been on any medicine for an entire year! it has been so hard for me to make it through the months it is physically and mentally draining i ended up in the hospital two times in 5 months for suicidal attemps and self harm i know its hard right now but we will get through it! if i can make it through than you can too! it might seem dark at times but there is a light at the end of the tunnel! there is a quote that always keeps me going "suicide doesnt end the pain it just passess it on to someone else" message me if you need anything!,1
its just pure ignorance they judge far too much they would have to go through it only then would they realise how cruel they have been to people suffering from a mental illnessive been suffering from depression for many years and yes ive tried to end my life several times im not ashamed of myself for being mentally ill but what has shocked me and deeply hurt me is that some people have turned their back on me yet ive always been there for them,0
honey you do still have the option to go back to the hospital just because you left once (with doctors okay) does not mean you can not go back when and if you need to sometimes its very helpful to be in the hospital for a bit i can imagine how hard and scary your time there was though ive taken wellbutrin before but its been a while if you need to talk to someone like you feel free to private message me ill keep your aninimity,0

hi there sounds as tho things are really pretty bad for you at the moment it must be so tough there are so many hideous feelings having a mental illness can bring but one of them the incessant worrying ruminating analysing must be one of the worst it never seems to stop unless you are lucky enough to have the respite of sleep if it comes the torment can feel so great it can be exhausting all encompassing and at times debilitating having anxiety and depression can often go hand in hand as one can bring on or worsen the other pushing people away can be for many reasons as you suggest but of course it can also be counter productive having a mental health problem can make you feel very alone and when you need people the most you can go to any lengths to almost hide from people these might all be very common traits but knowing that might not actually help of course you describe that you have been recently diagnosed as having bipolar but im wondering if you have any further support (professional) in light of this diagnosis have you been prescribed any medication to help or do you have access to any other support eg charities counselling etc? you have clearly been suffering a long time so it worries me in case you arent getting the best help but am unsure where you are and therefore which help might be out there in the uk the samaritans are a very good point of contact for support but not sure if you are in the us its a good thing you have reached out here and there are many caring soles here who understand understanding kindness and consideration can really make the difference when you feel so alone take good care of yourself try to reach out to those who you love x,0
the list is complete and the struggle is real,0
the thing you have to understand is that yes depression is mentally and physically exhausting to you but it is for them too maybe not as bad but it is i struggle with major depression and pretty bad anxiety and im a mother of a 13 month old girl being a mother has helped me in ways that medication cannot but i refuse to take medication at all so i do it all on my own just be understanding of him and the most you can do is go to therapy do not be mad but you have a right to be upset you can get through this both of you can  but both of you need patience,1
i feel so much pressure building up inside of me i feel i may just explode,0
yes i actually attempted it i put a belt around my neck and just let myself choke i did it in the closet before i knew it i was on a stretcher on my way to the hospital it was like 7am my girlfriend woke up to my cat meowing at the door very loudly when she opened it she said she grabbed my knife and cut me down i was out cold when i got to the hospital after a day or two they put me in the psych ward in there was where i learned how to cope and realized what my triggers were ive had some good things happen since then but i still struggle with it daily stopped taking the meds cuz i just dont believe in them but i just hold on to all the positive thing ive done and keep trying to be more positive i recently made a movie so i do my best to keep my mind busy,0
my anxiety fuels my agitation and rage and that fuels my anxiety it doesnt end just be very honest,1
i have trmd with severe anxiety my dr had me on busporin for quite a while 10mg 3 times a day - it actually worked okay for a fair period i have to say in all the time that i took busporin when it was working - it was just fine for me anyone on here have any more information on fetzima? i posted a question about this before - and someone was kind enough to put their experience as a reply - was just wondering if anyone else had any input on it?,1

finding a way to force yourself out of bed even if its just to the mailbox does make your entire day different you at least make it to the couch and think about leaving the house some days you end up leaving some days you are then able to force yourself to do some chores especially if you have someone depending on you to do so i know i may sound like someone who doesnt understand - but trust me  i do im there right now went somewhere and forced myself thru it back home now and feel the same way however i am forcing myself to go to iop at the local hospital before it gets so bad i need to go inpatient this life sux but having just that one person that understands and doesnt judge changes your life entirely - you just cant overload them or expect them to change you you have to put in the edson period and yes i agree it is the first sign it is not easy it does suck and i simply couldnt force myself through an 8 hour work day yet if you do and can my hats off to you some of us that deal with these issues are the strongest people in the whole damn world even though we appear very weak to others im hoping this group im starting soon have my intake hearing today puts me in touch with others going through the same thing  and we can help each other at this point in my life i strongly believe it is something i need in my life not just the online forums i visit when i get rough basically an accountability partner one that understands and u derstands you understand them close by so you can force each other to have a cup of coffee at mcdonalds or visit each other if all you can do is make it to the couch it sounds so damn cliche and its what we hear from people who have no idea what we deal with - but the last year ive found its true finding inner strength and not pouring my problems on others unless i absolutely have to has made me a stronger person it sure as shit isnt my medication changes if any of you are in this situation and need someone to talk to drop me a line im at the point in my life where i want to help others it makes you get out of yourself and how you dwell on how you feel it changes yourlife but it is so far from being easy believe me i understand those of you who will say  "he is just like everyone else" if you want to talk about the very slow steps ive taken drop me a line im teller you its been baby steps little baby steps over and over,0
its horrible,0
what we do in the shadows is funny after the dark (not scary but definitely worth watching) before i wake is a good new scary one although i find it quite beautiful,1
bp2 can have a depressed/manic ratio of 40:1 which means youll experience chronic depression with bouts of hypomania so it sounds like that may be what youre experiencing remember manic isnt always happy and feeling great it can also be just irrational and irratable behavior really anything where you have pent up energy that doesnt go away periods of pent up energy that manifests in negative emotions and actions are probably a mixed state which is when you have to be very mindful and aware as they can be the most dangerous part of living with bipolar i would journal as much as you can details about how you feel when you feel that way things you do how you act triggers that send you into depressed states or irritable or manic etc this can really help a psychiatrist see a pattern that makes it easier to diagnose whatever is going on,0
hi i suffer the same your background sound a bit like mine i was you not long ago my family walked on egg shells i never meant to be the way i was i just couldnt handle or cope until i was put on lithium it helped a lot my family started to feel more comfortable around me so maybe you need to look at your medsas for them understanding my husband doesnt need to understand just a hug when im feeling low or i just take time out and let everyone know im not feeling to good tell your kids and wife the truth about how your feeling that way they know its not them its your illness i tell my kids and they understand theyve lived through it with me not telling your wife and kids that when you feel the way you do and if your nasty or irrational its not there fault you cant go through this on your own your a family and letting them in they get to know the real you and your wife and kids will be able to go through life feeling understood you also need to say sorry when youre being nasty or say something you shouldnt it takes time but as family we worked it out im sure you can too i am also 40 and think it gets a little bit harder i hope this has helped if you need to ask me anything you can pm me i know what its like x,0

im going through this now i bitch myself out and tons of negative self talk because i cant shake the guilt im a miserable person to be around even skipping one or two days id like to think that meds arent helping since i still struggle plenty on them but its when i miss a dose or two that i realize theyre a life saver i wouldnt function very long in a med free state of mind as it is i try to limit my interactions as much as possible so as to limit the stimuli that i will dwell on and beat myself up over i know your struggle all too well,0

you make me very sad i know what it feels like to feel as though that is the only answer to feel like it would make it easier but friend you can be happy there are ways to end all that pain without taking your life you cant control others you cant control their behavior or their feelings or how they treat you you can only control you push away from those things or people who make you miserable and start again i have found when i walk away from those things that make me unhappy it is a relief they say you shouldnt run from your problems but there is nothing wrong with letting go of toxic things and toxic people if you want to talk you can private message me,0

caregivers must be well in order to properly look after their loved ones seek the treatment you need and though it may be hard cast aside any guilt for seeking treatment because there should be none you dont need your familys consent or their approval to seek treatment forcing yourself to suck it up may make things worse in the long run cant offer people something to drink if your pitcher is empty  do what you have to do for yourself for your well-being and for your future,1

as far as i know there are pregnancy safe meds to take but very very few im almost 8 months pregnant been on zoloft the whole time and i have 3 different types of doctors all telling me zoloft is safe some meds are class c and the doctor has to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk they may decrease your dosage or take you off completely and give you something considered safe most of the time staying on your meds while pregnant is better for you and the baby you staying stable is whats best for the baby they will watch you closely talk to your doctor about zoloft its worked well for me tho yes everyone reacts different its helped keep me stable with my bipolar depression and anxiety,1
you are normal the depression and anxiety are not you are not the only one i have seen the depths of hell during depression,1
im sorry i know how you feel about having a hard time with a new dr i hate new doctors you never know if they suck or not and then i have an extensive medical history from a tbi and many new draft have the magical fix they want to test on me then the first time i admitted i needed psych help the medicine effected me poorly and the dr refused to listen so i had to go to the er and once admitted i had to beg and plead until i found a nurse who would let me call my husband and let him know what was going on and so my kids could come see me before i was admitted it took forever to find the right everything for psych its hard i have bpd ocd and gad sometimes im hate myself as a mom too i have one with a mental illness that has been a struggle for him and i sometimes wonder if he has the early signs of bpd and i worry about my younger ones and i worry i passed my mental and physical crap on to them (tbi was from a tumor) it freaking sucks when you want to die want help and help isnt there just take it one moment at a time one moment you can do it,0
you cut because you are nervous and it relieves anxiety if you figure out what times you do it and what is going through your head when you do it that will help it gives you some kind of satisfaction if you can find something else to do with your mind and your body at that time that is positive it might help can you draw crochet or knit when you are feeling anxious like this if these things make you more nervous dont do them so long,1
youre feeling overwhelmed and frustrated and thats entirely understandable and youre not alone talking about this helps tremendously and well done for taking the step of reaching out some ideas that may help you are: meditation light exercise - just going for a walk around the block will help to give you some "space" in your head so you can focus and concentrate more keep your water intake at optimum levels and dont skip breakfast above all be kind to yourself this is a challenging time for you you have everything you need to get through this even if it may feel that you dont i wish you all the best keep talking about it and allow yourself to experience the underlying emotions the awful symptoms you have will subside i promise it may help to make a list of the studying you need to do and then prioritise it based on what you know well and what you dont take baby steps and before you know it youll be finished studying dont beat yourself up it is obviously important to you to finish this year and pass and im sure you will with flying colours,0

i have always taken my lamictal in one dose asked my dr if i could she looked up the half life & told me i could its more convenient & i dont miss doses some drs tell me it needs to be in 2 doses yet ive never had any of them look up the half life i continued to take it in one dose but i tell the dr whatever they want to hear lamictal is a mood stabilizer abilify is an anti-psychotic medication lexapro zoloft etc are anti-depressant drugs be careful not to compare these drugs to one another it would be like comparing apples to oranges lastlycheryl berndt you are confused genetic disorders like bipolar depression gad adhd are treatable with medications things like ptsd narcissistic personality disorder stockholm syndrome etc are also mental illnesses yet these are some types of mental illnesses that medication does little for they are not a chemical imbalance,1
if you are at risk of harm you must go to the er its really important the 4th isnt that far away if you can hang on until then can you see your dr sooner? all the best,0

i can relate to what youre going through im struggling right now too just had a bad reaction to a new drug i recently started yes it gets extremely frustrating at times but please know youre not alone i have struggled with most of the available mood stabilizers in fact there is only one i havent yet taken i dont respond well to these meds so my psychiatrist recently recommended genetic testing thats been a real eye opener and finally explained why there were problems taking certain meds i recommend to anyone who has been unsuccessful with medications,0
how i feel most days and its like a daily struggle to just get up and get going but i cant seem to get anyone to understand,0
not everyone has depression your boss is a twit depression is an illness thats like saying that everyone has heart disease or diabetes hes an idiot about self-harmquite often self harm is caused by a need to have control in ones own life (a feeling of helplessness that combines with depression for a very nasty mix) its time you got some control back 1 this is of the utmost importance get a new job theres absolutely no reason to put up with verbal abuse from an employer he should show more professionalism you shouldnt have to put up with it i know its scary but youll feel more in control of your life if you start looking for a new job ive worked a lot in my life and ive only ever had one boss who thought it was okay to cuss her employees first time she did it to me i quit that moment please dont put up with that crap its apparent the job doesnt give you insurance so theres no reason for you to be there when you can find something better maybe your next job shouldnt be as a customer service rep? it doesnt seem to be a good fit for you personally especially at this point in your life look into doing things youd love instead 2 friends dont just run away when things get rough true friends will do what they can to help you maybe its time you assessed the people you have been hanging around? you need to find new friends (real ones) but you cant do that until you get your depression under control 3 go back to church there has to be like the little volunteer lady or the pastor or his wife or someone who is known for being compassionate talk to them if nothing else ask to talk to your pastor for spiritual counseling its free and it might help you somewhat (if nothing else youd have someone to talk to for a bit about what youre feeling) 4 check into local mental health resources that might be available for cheap or free in your area there may be a support group you can join you dont have to be alone depression is an illness it is systemic it starts in the mind but its not long before it takes control of the entire body you need to have it treated like you would if you had pneumonia or diabetes or any other serious illness youd go to the doctor for it if you must go to an er if theres a "charity" hospital in your town go to their er you desperately need to be treated for your depression you might need medications depression is often caused by chemical imbalances in a persons brain you cant "sleep it off" it doesnt work that way thatd be like telling the person with diabetes (a chemical imbalance dealing with the pancreas) that they can just sleep it away thats not how any of this works if you take nothing else from my post please remember this depression is a liar it lies to you about your worth your own abilities your life and the people who love you it tells you that no one cares it says that everyone hates you or that theyd be better off without you it whispers that you will never be good enough or that youll never amount to anythingor your dreams for your life will never be fulfilled these are lies it says the same type of things to every sufferer those lies play like a broken record in your mind you need to get away from them medication and therapy would do a lot for you if youre cutting a lot you may need some hospital time it would definitely make people in your life take you more seriously when you say that youre sick dont kill yourself or anything like that please keep reaching out there are people who will respond who are willing to be there for you the world is a big place with a lot of wonderful people in it who would help you care for you and be there for you just keep trying,0
when i took lamictal and trazodone together i would have terrifying dreams within dreams about being attacked in the middle of the night i never knew when i was awake or asleep,0
a lot of people have no idea what its like to have severe depression they are very fortunate but because they once had a bit of a low period they think theyve had depression and judge it on their experience they have no idea how debilitating it is you just get looked at like youre talking a load of crap and exaggerating its the same with anxiety its pure torture and they dont believe you because they once had a bit of anxiety and it wasnt as bad as youre making out would love to see how these people would cope with severe anxiety and depression theyd never judge us again,0

my husband also suffers from depression and to be honest i found that just being there next to him whether its sitting in the bed just reading or being in the house as much as i can is a great comfort we arent all capable of expressing our feelings and at those times i just leave it until he is up to talking being bipolar myself i know how much i can give him before it affects me and i feel no guilt about it a weak me is going to be no good if he is weak too,1
girl i just got out of a marriage with someone that didnt get my anxiety at all it was hard but i left i would rather be by myself and wait for the true person that is going to love and accept me for me anxiety and depression and all and not going to get mad in the middle of the night because i need to breathe and need help because there is someone out there like that being alone and figuring out how to love myself has been such a great journey know your worth beautiful dont accept less than bullshit,0
there is if you dont even know what dbt is and/or have never been to dbt or were just recently diagnosed there are a lot of factors your comment is not helpful i had no idea what the hell was even wrong until a year ago because i was only diagnosed with anxiety and depression and didnt even know what bpd was until after a 10 day stay in the psych ward and a meeting with my psychiatrist i havent gotten to start dbt yet but ive looked some of the skills up and im trying not every therapist or psych dr tells their patients about dbt though maybe think before you speak?,0

put yourself first i wouldn´t go if it triggered me this is one of those times you need to cut out the toxic people in your life if they can´t understand what you´re going through than you don´t need them to bring you down either they respect your wishes or they don´t it may seem like alienation but you´re trying to survive with mental illnesses you can´t control the way your mind is they will come back around when they realize you´re trying to make yourself better seek therapy and stay in it it´s hard for people like me with borderline to find a good therapist or stay in therapy i highly suggest dbt that´s a good therapy for borderlines we are our greatest enemies it´s okay to say no don´t worry about pleasing everyone your sanity will thank you for putting you first those people have their own issues they need to work on themselves yoga helps writing in a journal helps dbt helps replace negative thinking with positive thoughts find positive quotes online and write them down start with one little thing that´s positive and work on that you´ll see a slow change,1

i have been in a relationship for 6 years with my bp boyfriend and i can tell you it hasnt been an easy road!! honesty trust and most of all communication is essential as well as an understanding of his illness through reading posts like these he has his own room therefore his own space for whenever he needs it and i respect his need for it im slowly developing a thick skin for his hurtful words and actions when hes manic because i see the great person he truly is beneath his fears phobias and anxiety and try to reassure him and help keep him grounded so far so good dont give up on love the right one is out there waiting for you xxxx,0

bipolar disorder is a spectrum mood disorder theres type i ii and cyclothymic which is a less severe classification between i and ii with type i the cycles are longer and you experience more episodes of mania type ii (which is what i have) you experience whats called hypomania a less severe form of type type is mania you may be irritable snappy productive and goal oriented but with a short temper the cycles for type ii are shorter and more frequent cyclothymia is when you have frequent cycles between being "low" but not suicidally depressed and hypomanic you operate closer to baseline but you have frequent episodes between depression and hypomania type ii however is where you have cycles between hypomania and extreme suicidal depression type i can be difficult and dangerous because of the impulsive and reckless behavior associated with mania but type ii sends you into frequent states of suicidal ideation the good news however is that both are manageable with medication and a good psychotherapist,1
i too experienced hair loss with depakote- what happened is it takes a while for the depakote to start the hair loss- doubt seriously it has anything to do with the name brand or the generic selenium is supposed to help decrease the hair loss but i found it continued unabated until i stopped the medication and my hair was never as thick again after the hair loss i kept the hair in a ziplock bag because i knew they doctors would just write it off- when i brought in a full bag of hair they could see why i was upset and requesting a medication change,1

i have bipolar 1 and chose not to have kids- worried that my moods irritability you name it would not make me a good mom and did worry about going without meds i am 60 now and do not regret my decision,1
walking a lot diet helps too things like turkey and chicken help with sleep anxiety is harder mine hits with change and a lot at night with dreams typically i have to sit in the car and talk myself down if im out in public at night my wife is really awesome about just holding me until it passes i do a lot of vitamins as well lol it works for me but i had to rewire my thinking and that took sometime,1
i get hypomania but i dread to think how life would be with mania :(,0
just ask them to seriously back off explain yourself and hopefully they try to understand its been a struggle for me the last 2+ yrs and at least mom understands i cant do everything nowadays :/,0
its the fear and anxiety of being stuck while life passes me by,1
having bp ii i can honestly say that every med is different and not always easy to adjust too i hated lexepro i had horrible brain fuzz for the first week whenever you are trying a new med patience is key the side effects wear off after a few days if they dont maybe its not the right med for you there isnt one combo of meds that treats bp every treatment is as unique as the individuals brain being treated what i can tolerate may not be tolerable for you but if after a week things are not feeling a little more manageable and after two weeks youre not adjusting then call your doctor!!!!!! seriously sadly this illness is not a one size fits all it truly is trial and error until you find the right dosage that works for you mine was no anti depressant and a smaller dose of seroquel and a big dose of therapy and dont he work patience,1
living with depression anxiety and whatever label you want to give mei just reached this point of understanding for me i had to go through many many years of meds and therapy that didnt actually fix the problem ive been thinking heavily on this and really found comfort in your post bc this is the first time i saw another person who has this understanding,0
it shows the most in there eyes then when you try to live with somebody that doesnt take there meds  if you care about them this embalace can make a whole house in turmoil they wont addmit they have a problem they just find away to blame it on you its sad to watch somebody life that is bipolar if a person is diagnose bipolar it sucks but if you care about that person your life will be happier helping them to stay on they meds been through it for 22 years,1
ive been on both i found them very much the same in terms of anxiety control they helped to stabilise my mood somewhat but neither one were great i found the seroquel made me super drowsy to the point that i was a useless lump of a human being with no drive to do anything however my partner is on seroquel and hes had no side effects and its helping him a lot the zyprexa made my appetite insatiable and my metabolism stopped so i gained 15kgs in 3 months i have now been put on ziprasidone and its a life saver i have found its the best medication i could go on i havent had any side effects from it in the 6 months ive been on it but everyone is different and medication is trial and error,1
risperidone has worked well for me i have been taking it primarily for anxiety 1 mg per day it definitely has made a difference i have not experienced weight gain but i have a lot of experience with meds so i know how to manage the hunger side-effects,1
unbelievable!! whoo!! first thing first i want to appreciate you being so opened minded ive living with bipolar anxiety and major insomnia and depression i will be very honest i was like that many years ago but first things first we must accept admit our mental illnesses only us indidviuals​ ​whom are living can only explain to our soulmates but we must conquer defeat discipline our minds thoughts yes its very hard but mind over matter if we driving ourselves insane crazy; i can imagine our loved ones that dont deal cope w that illnesses pray my friend be strong focus on daily days being at ease jolly content i know its very hard but this is one way to express our thoughts feelings expression what i do first thing i wake up i thank the man my savior jesus thanks for another day of life! then focus staying positive keep away from negative human beings really! i will keep supporting all my friends to give them strength support and never give up! remember today is gone perhaps tomorrow is not promised! love yourself respect yourself forgive yourself believe yourself and faith talk to jesus ask him w all your heart & soul for strengh and plenty of patience remember were all gods children! he loves us unconditionally! god is good all the time to everyone! no matter what good or bad situations were dealing in our lives! stay strong to survive! ,0
hi! heres a little background that will help you understand where im coming from my family has always shut the door to mental illness at 19 i got pregnant and then "forced" into a marriage with the father (doctor refused to put fathers name on birth certificate bc we werent married) i was then abused and had 2 more children by unconsentual sex i finally left at age 22 with my 3 babies my ex husband tried to kill me and unfortunately lost my children (they live with my folks) ive always known that i was different mentally ive had some other pretty messed up stuff happen to me im now 27 years old taking a handful of meds daily in 2012 i finally went to get a mental evaluation per orders from dcf i went in cool as a cucumber bc i knew i was normal come out of there with severe ptsd bipolar anxiety depression ocd insomnia so forth & so on and scared to death bc i wasnt normal ive come to terms that im not normal but ive also become unsure of what normal is!!! i moved into a home across the alley from my folks and live a somewhat "normal" life i still have the daily struggle with the fact that im not "normal" but ive also started to wonder wth normal is ive fought with my own mother for some time about her self inflicted ignorance about mental disorders (she feels its all in our heads) my mom refuses to believe that bipolar is a chemical imbalance in my brain she refuses to believe that someone that isnt in the military can have ptsd she tells me that i worry too much thats what anxiety is the way i look at it is being cookie cutter normal is boring at least im exciting lol!!! embrace who you are sweetie! we are who we are for a reason loving yourself especially because youre extraordinary is such a wonderful feeling as for the seroquel i personally have a love hate relationship with it i am on such a high dose that i cannot function unless i take it after i am in bed for the night i dont like the fact that i am jello after i take it but i notice a very big difference if i dont take it my friend jokes and tells me its the pill that masks lol it helps me look "normal" i am on such a high dosage that it helps me through out the day function as a responsible adult i totally understand that there is such a high stigma with mental illness but whatever it is is no different from any other disease its not like after diagnosis and medication it will be tattooed on our foreheads i worried for 2 years that people could tell i was a medicated psycho but when i explained to my boyfriend he said "it seemed like you had your ducks in a row better than most people without mental disorders" ive showed my self harming scars and he didnt even notice the thick ugly scars until i pointed them out i truly hope that things get better for you and that you get the help you need whatever it may be my advice is hold your head high even when you feel that you cant educate before you medicateand love yourself even when you feel unworthy!,0
if you need medication to help you feel better there is no shame to that in fact does it really matter which diagnosis you have? by that i mean it is so important for us to know what is going on and why but then we come up with a game plan when my biological mother was alive there was not as much advancement as there is now in mental illness in defining it and in treating it you are not alone i know how difficult that can be and how lonely we can feel i do know that once i started to understand what was happening to me and why it helped because i now knew it was not a failing of mine it was my brain there is no shame in that can the medication help? if so it seems like it may be worth a shot i recommend writing down a list of what your concerns are talk it out with your psychiatrist take your time and go through all your fears and concerns so that you can find a medication that may help then start at a low dose and work your way up listen there are so many people who share your diagnosis mental illness is no different from any other illness in the sense that it is an illness if you can treat it please do so in the best way for you i am sorry you are going through this and i wish you the best please remember that you are not alone,0
its a horrible thing but remember you are never alone you have been brave in what you are doing now in a hope to get better xx,0
i wish you strength on your journey i struggle with bipolar ii and anxiety disorder and am 34weeks pregnant my baby has been my strength and reason to stay well nd fight thru the thoughts,1
ask for help immediately the dynamics in your household need to change so you feel and have less pressure,1
sometimes when i get nervous or anxious i get paranoid,0
brenda benefield thank you that was advice from the doctors anxiety turned into excruciating muscle spasms and seizure-like episodes that lasts for hours medication and therapy is a necessity also but you have to help yourself find out about all the symptoms of manic dep so you can win some battles you will never win the big war but accept the battles that you win as something learned ive written research papers and helped therapists on ways to come up out of depression if youre interested it will work for you god be with all of you hugs to all,1
set an alarm on ur phone and repeat the times so they continue each day and the times to remind you,0
melissa thorn i had terror,0
cloverfield without a doubt to this day ive never watched anything as awful! and ive seen frozen a few thousand times,0
the reality is life is hard its how you respond to what happens that makes or breaks you not every day is a good day but there are plenty of good days ahead decide what drama you are willing to deal with let go of the situations and people who bring nothing but negative energy in your life do you have a family or friends who love you??? i am a mother who lost her son to suicide he was 20 im telling you this because the pain you feel that makes you think you should end your life is the pain your loved ones will feel forever if you do and if you have a mom who loves you and you take your life you sentence her to a living death so please reconsider!!! you were given a life to live take care of yourself dont try to fix everything at once when you have moments that seem too hard light a candle watch a good movie read the bible or another good book listen to your favorite music until it passes if you have to get a job try to get into something not so stressful learn something new every day volunteer at an animal shelter if you can get a pet go for walks go for a swim find someone to talk to that you know you can count on but stay in this life its not always fair and the hard times seems to go on forever but they dont there is good in this world and its worth fighting for,0
it sounds like your agitating and highly anxious which is understandable hang in there the clothes wont hide how you feel,0
i only use vistaril at night to help me sleep if im restless knocks me out literally within minutes no way i can take it during the day for that reason,1
i would try to remember that despite their best intentions loved ones who dont have these same illnesses sometimes dont know what to do to help us because we love them their opinions mean the most and can hurt us the most in times like this i would suggest possibly checking into couples counselling to educate him as well i hear everyone whos saying stay on your meds but i can say from experience sometimes they make things worse especially if we are given to many or ones that are not working for us ive seen amazing results with natural treatment but that doesnt work for everyone the worst is doctors prescribing many meds who are not specialists in this area a good psychiatrist could help you get them balanced out if you feel your on to many and are not already seeing one this is a life long struggle for so many of us please dont give up keep trying different things until you find what works for you mediation and mindfulness and dbt can also be very helpful wishing you the best ❤️,0
i think ive got a lot to talk about with my doctor! dbt therapy or bipolar? im so confused ,0
it is so hard to make yourself not feel guilty but to help others you must take care of yourself,0
i have bipolar and my ex girlfriend also had bipolar and she was like this she was a great girlfriend but she wasnt able to be faithful for a second she loved me i have no doubts of it we talked about it a lot but she literally had no control over her sex drive and also one of the possible symptoms of bipolar is inappropriate sexual conduct which i myself am guilty of too at times same as reckless driving for me on my motorcycle it makes me feel moire alive if u know what i mean all u can do is just do what u have been doing and try not to act on it if u can help it and be careful u dont catch a std other than that a little bit of fun never killed anyone =p,1
yes yes yes and i hate it it scares me i wish i could stop it,1
deep breathing is the absolute best way to handle anxiety take a deep breath in through your mouth hold for 5 seconds then release slowly as if you are blowing through a straw repeat multiple times you should also look up progressive muscle relaxation its a very useful tool where you tighten parts of your body and release sounds weird but is very credible and works,1
the idea of suicide being selfish is a selfish notion in itself constantly hearing or seeing people say/write "but what about the people you leave behind (of which the person speaking/writing is usually one) doesnt help anything people who commit suicide believe without a doubt that they are doing the best thing for everyone they know it is not simply about their own pain or mental stateit is much deeper and much more complex than that as someone who attempted suicide multiple times when i was younger i can tell you with complete certainty that when you make the decision to take your own life it is more about removing the burden of having to care for or deal with their issues,0
i take sertraline which covers both depression and anxiety cant imagine being without half meds though xx,1
was approved about 10 years ago for bi-polar ii anxiety panic attacks depression etc (after being denied 2 years prior) however have spent the last 5 months being reviewed to see if im still disabledwhich has only made my condition worse but social security continues to drag this out so even if you get approved there is no guarantee how long it will last,1
propanalol made my anxiety 10x worse and cause palpitations,1
so many people so many offended by this just a quote for one and for another its just giving you an out so you dont have to worry its a "god" of your understanding it clearly did not say be christian or be anxious wow!,0
when i get hypo mania ive get so much energy for days and days i dont sleepi dont eati dont need to  i cant stay still i fidget to much i talk way too fast im super social around other people( i dont have to pretend to be happy  its awsome  )for me the most scariest thing of all is when im coming down from that massive high ( it happens in a split second) then i turn into this furious ball of evil anger the voices and the noise gets so loud in my head that i cant stop them i cant control them they wont shut up then depression comes back and hits 1 million times harder than before its not fun its actually really scary not being able to control myself and not remembering what i have done or said,0
im not schizophrenic and i hear a voice that isnt my own mental voice but i have dissociative depersonalisation disorder and ptsd its always a good idea to speak to your doctor about your worries i believe there are tests that can help pinpoint the issue,1
bobbi nicole sullivan sorry im kind of a zyprexa fanboy i just think its a really good med with mild side effects but gets a bad rap because of the possible weight gain/diabetes risk i dunno when youve got bipolar disorder schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder pretty much any med theyll give you is gonna suck in some way unfortunately you just gotta figure out which set of side effects sucks the least for you personally i cant handle the creepy-crawly restless limb stuff or tremors ill take the possible weight gain any day of the week but hey maybe ill be changing my tune if the zyprexa gives me diabetes haha,1
aurore poinot sa soir jai appris alarmer anglais donc je tidentie,0
ive taken it for years and 80% of the time helps great if im having bad panic attacks or flashbacks its not like ive taken anything,1
most of what not to say has been said to me by my family who from the word go had decided that they werent going to acknowledge my ptsdsevere depanxiety issuesit is during this time that i needed them the most  that they decided not to be there for mea couple of years on now and they still dont support me what so evernever even ask me simple things like - do you eat regulardo you manage to sleepdo you manage to get any support-just nothingwell what i learnt was family isnt always loyal,0
no i felt the same way yesterday no acknowledgement no gift nothing it was a horrible day,0
yelling is a part of verbal abuse and yes it most certainly will effect her confidence and self esteemseven is a bit young yet to explain disorders but if one day you were to have a mother/daughter moment say brushing her hair you could approach the subject and maybe also try to assure her that you will also try to think things through before you yellmy son had the same problem with mei am softspoken but when i get scared because i told him not to do something and he did it anyway boy that makes me madbut i want him to be confident to speak up so i promised i would try not to blow up but he had to do what i asked him to do,0
my thoughts exactly she said yesterday if she doesnt get some money soon shell be forced to move back to mine! like i want that stress! told her to speak to her parents,0
i suggest the book loving someone with bipolar disorder as a starting off point maybe go to counseling together your husband needs to understand your illness if he is to help you in turn it helps him and those three boys who didnt ask to be brought into this world or situation if they are too young to understand that mommy is sick theyre not too young to understand tension and strife between you and your husband the two of you together owe it to them to do what you can to make this situation right good luck,0
i know for my fiance and i we struggle with communication so theres always a point where we sit on our bed and just have a talk i let him go first and he can vent and talk about how he is handling things what hes stressed about etc then i will chime in dont blame him for the way he is feeling or anything like that just focus on trying to understand each others thoughts and feelings i am so sorry that you are experiencing this i really hope i was able to help at all,0
yeah when you find that switch could you tell me where it is id love to switch off all my mental problemsbipolar2 generalized depressive disorder anxiety ptsd adhd chronic painlove to switch all this crap off,1
pray ask god come into your life its satan thats doing ths to u hes giving u a horrible life god will heal what satan scumbags damaged do it now you will have peace love contentment keepin u in prayer xox,0
i think its just extreme anxiety and depression i dont think anything else is acting up,1
is that confusing moment where life is perfect around you but deep inside your heart is breaking confused as to what is wrong with us why are we still not happy still not good enough to deserve happiness,0
i hate to say it but most teenagers are made to do a lot of housework its just a part of growing up you need to talk to your parents about seeing a dr self diagnosing is never a good idea mental health is a complex illness and there are many factors that go into a diagnosis do you have s school counsellor that you can speak to? i know you must feel pretty bad now but your lack of friends most likely wouldnt be because you are too ugly or too fat it might be how you feel but anxiety and illnesses like depression can make you believe things that arent true have your old friends said that? if they did then be grateful they arent in your life anymore i really strongly suggest you speak with your parent about seeing a doctor who can refer you to a psychiatrist for evaluation and a therapist to give you some tools to help you cope if you like to research try cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness these are 2 approaches used in the mental health space and can really help,0
my kids and meds i wont lie and it gets easier but with support you can get better now i think of my grandson that i want to be there to meet i realized i cant leave my children in this world alone i have highs and lows but i just tell myself that if im gone my babies will be split up and they will be destroyed because i left them for reasons they couldnt understand if you dont have kids just think about all the things that you want to do despite your "darkness" and how those things will never happen if you go through with it trust me i was sitting in my car on a dark road 2 weeks ago and thinking that i might as well because i was so tired of dealing with the depression and anxiety taking meds seeing doctors but my children and husband kept calling my phone i could hear the hurt in their voices i passed out i dont know how long but when i looked up i saw the lights on my husbands truck and i drove to to a stop sign and he saw me tears in his eyes i knew that i could not do that to my family no matter how i struggle i know that they need me and i need them just as much,0
all who are suffering i have been there also be assured that this also comes and goes you fill as though youre suffocating when panic sets in i find talking to a friend or anyone who can take it mind to a different place will get u through it find that place i pick up my guitar it helps you will become frightened and that makes it worse im older and have dealt with it for many years  be assured youre not dying keep a blood pressure pulse monitor with you as you calm down your pulse will stabilize save yourself time money and embarrassment finding the proper med combination will help greatly ur drs will find them talk weekly with phycotheripest dont miss appointments help them help you!!!,1
why in the world would you keep that from him this long? he will probably be relieved knowing you have a reason for your actions imagine what he thinks now? it might help you to have someone that can help you realize when youre cycling my husband is a huge help letting my doctor know when im struggling most of the time we dont realize or remember how bad weve gotten time to put on your big girl panties and tell him also get a new doctor there is no such thing as borderline bi-polar kinda like being borderline pregnant!,0
are you using for bipolar? or anxiety? i gave up drinking and its been the best choice i stopped having any day after blues,1
true that mania is often times looked at as being high high typically conjures up thoughts of enjoyment its fun and exciting when its ramping up but the fun goes away fairly quickly the excitement stays but not its not a good excitement feelings of invincibility delusions overinflated sense of self irritability reckless behavior and a really short fuse for those who dare get in the way of the goings on in our life our life being the things we are doing when manic taking over the world building rockets to fly to space figuring out the equation for time travel and in our spare time submit to an overindulgence in anything we love doing did i mention reckless behavior? if not add reckless behavior to the list before i forget reckless behavior thats just the euphoric mania then comes the shame and guilt of the loss of impulse control overcommitting ourselves to friends family employers and customers burning through cash paying for our overindulgence and the frustration of having to get caught up on the things that really matter which of course by the time we have our mental faculties restored are left completely exhausted and have no energy to do any of it mania is a dangerous condition then there is dysphoric maniaim not even going to start that one most of my manic episodes are dysphoric lets just say that dysphoric mania is extremely destructive,0
usually used for restless leg not mental issues va is notorious for mismanagement of mental health issues,1
i dont know i take cymbalta as well and i cant get past the dizzys i make my doctor put me back on it unfortunately im at the highest dose for therapeutic use little scared of what they will have to use next i hate withdrawl,1
money! to end the debts bills and financial worries,0
honestly i would ask her about it ive been through this and its a nightmare anxiety and depression affect me as well and you cant just go on not knowing if it blows up in your face yeah its going to hurt but at least youre going to know why shes acting that way i wish you luck and i hope you can stay strong this will pass,0
its a struggle at times,0
i hear that you are seeking information to support you im not one to say what is and isnt ok im one who struggles with this and i have heard many responses to this question i can only answer this question for myself in me i find my answer and i can say that choosing to be responsible for my own life and yes im highly aware that loved ones would be affected by taking my lifethe struggle is real and having someone who provides safety for you through this darknessis more helpful then hearing about the impact it could have on loved ones i know cause i have someone who has given me the safe space and can hold this for me when i struggle the most that when i have heard that im not alonein this dark place my part is reaching out to this person when im there or feel that im sliding into this place i hope you can find someone who can provide you the safety and support to be there for you! im learning through this that im of value and have been heard and healing can continue ,0
seroquel is known for being sedating i was never irritable or confrontational on it but i suppose it is possible,0
ive read vitamin d helps with acne just taking it as a supplement also try sleeping with a white pillow case because some dyes irritate the skin there are a lot of things in a diet that can also affect the skin and hormone problems as well,1
i have severe adhd ptsd depression and anxiety plus a dissociative disorder so finding a drug that works is hard i just take hydroxizine now im pregnant so after baby comes ill try things again effexor never again tripped me out,1
im almost 44 and the same thing happened to me just 3 weeks ago i was diagnosed bipolar 2 almost 3 years ago no matter what medication my doctor put me on it didnt work or i had horrible side effects i went into a 3 week day hospital program new psychiatrist looking into my history instantly thinks adhd start treating me for that by day 2 i felt better than i have in almost 10 years that being said the depression/irritability is starting to come back i fully expect at my next appt with my regular psychiatrist shell be adding an anti depressant adhd was never something i thought i had despite 8 other family members having it including my son,0
well ill listen to my drs they know more than any of you ive researched which are safe and which arent so to all of you on meds whilst pregnant i hope your happy with yourselves for putting your children at risks you stupid fucks,1
i tried your way jenny franklin and i tried to commit suicide twice always with a smile on my face saying that thinking positive and surrounding myself with positive thinkers i ate the right foods that would help me have a clear mind and energy to live it all failed twice not everyone can cope without intervention of medicine and therapy from good people if they hadnt talked some sense into me about what i was doing to myself i wouldnt be here im dealing with a loss in my family right now and this is the first time ever that i havent had a complete meltdown i feel strong and i can be strong for my kids they lost their dads sister to cancer and they need me to be momnot a hysterical puddle of panic attacks and mood swings,0
its going to get better your doing everything you can right now  your going in the right directioni felt the same like you  i actually had 3 sucides and i cam back from all of them i happy now i got treat with the same meds your taking if there not working ask for something eles if you dont do anything all day it ok you are doing enough by surviving try baths or massage i could not even leave my house bc of my anxiety i pretended for a long time to be fine  therapy and meditation combo helped,1
you will come to understand your illness ( same as mine ) as you go through therapy i thought a lot of things i wasdoing and feeling were normal if there is such a thing found out in therapy that they were part of the disease ! took a bit to find the best meds but now i have way less anxiety and terrible depression and my ocd has really proved your therapist is your best advocate,1
the time of the month is my trigger for depressive episodes something about the hormones i would tell your school they can usually make exceptions for medical conditions my friend received extra time to complete tests i went through failing out of school before i decided to go back on medication now that im on meds im going back to school this fall dont be afraid to ask for help and be open to medicine hang in there!,0
yeah john travolta as an alien - disturbing on so many levels,0
not just that it becomes an addiction after awhile i do it all the time then i find myself buying things i dont really need then realizing your broke causes more anxiety,1
usually when i am manic is when i go into spiralling uncontrollable rages too not one thing fun about that either,0
damm straight just because you want to be head and chop up into little peices everyone who has belittled terrorized and hurt you in the past :(apparently thats not normal :(,0
no this is not normal get your thyroid checked check your diet med check--get you some buspar get that exhausting anxiety in check get some exercise--even just a walk around the block,1
cbd oil helps really well with anxiety and depression its made from marijuana but without the thc that gets you high its over the counter in health stores in florida pretty sure it is in all 50 states right now,1
this may sound stupid but the thing that has kept me going is comics and superhero stories growing up thats all i had to fall back on to feel better knowing that these people dont budge in the face of adversity was something i admired and wished i could be like not knowing what happens next in these stories because im gone causes me more distress than any problems i have im so grateful for people such as stan lee for bringing these stories to the world and giving me something to cling to until i can hold my own,0
i saw that but as someone who was afraid of my meds after reading all the awful stuff made me second guess taking it i am so thankful i was told that same advice,1
try and remember that depression doesnt last forever it will lift eventually lift and you will have some peace it is a brutal disease and i too have struggled with suicidal thoughts and i know how bad they hurt stay strong never let bipolar win,0
i took effexor for years it helped me a great deal though i was always super tired and i gained quite a bit of weight on it i was afraid to go off it after hearing about side effects but i really didnt have any trouble at all my dr weaned me properly if this med works for you stick with it for a while,1
believe me i know what you mean my parents know i have anxiety & i do stress out over bills but they dont no what i go through they tell me to not stress & that im okay i normally have my fiance who talks to me who lets me no he is there to support me & that everything is going to be okay  i mean i really dont no what else to do people dont understand,0
panic disorder is on the dsm and needs immediate treatment as does self harm feelings of suicide are very serious and you need to find and emergency room psych ward right away and tell them youre a harm to yourself and check yourself in and they will refer you later to a proper psychiatrist right now you need a higher level of care go get it dear!,1
cant you put the animals in crates and close the bedroom door so you guys could sleep together? i know crate training takes time but in the end you will both come to find out the less the animals disturb your sleep the better you both feel,1
if there was a god he wouldnt have given you anxiety in the first place some imaginary creation is just going to make your mental health worse because your believing in something thats not real! if you want to beat your anxiety its all on you its hard work but you can do it i just get the odd moments now it was hard work but i pushed through myself with no imaginary friends,0
i have bpd and bipolar 2 my bad days sneak up on me even though i am taking my meds as prescribed when i notice that i am going down i distract myself i keep my hands busy so im not itching to harm myself i knit and to take my mind off things i watch series or a movie if you have pets they are great for therapy marijuana does help alot with anxiety in this last year i havent been able to have much therapy because money has been super tight so i had to teach myself to cope please phone your doctor to adjust your meds so you have enough for the month if you find you cant cope with what ive mentioned for distracting yourself then definitely go to the er they will be able to sedate you to keep the edge off before you can get your prescription best of luck i hope things come right,1
i also work nights because i cant work with the public nor a lot of co workers and though i still have lots of anxiety and feel at times i wanna pass out or hide i try to collect myself and keep going! i have had my illnesses since i was 12 also and i am now 45 so we walk in different shoes but have some similar experiences!,1
i have tried to go off meds gradually several times but it didnt go well i am currently taking 3 different meds for my depression/anxietyi have accepted the fact that i will always be on meds,1
emily dickinson was far from successful she was a recluse due to her struggles and her work was largely unpublished during her lifetime,0
i can definitely relate i cry not because sad/upset but when im so frustrated then i get angry because im crying i have learnt (at work where it can get bitchy) to walk away otherwise i go off big time and become very nasty some dont like me walking away but its a strategy i use,0
when i was still at school i had another student ask me "why arent you normal" i asked him "define normal" and he just looked confused for a couple seconds before walking away,0

absolutely separation from a partner can become a common trigger for anxiety or panic attacks your mind may ruminate over bad thoughts they may be your main support you may worry about them med adjustments and cbt can help just stick with it,1
first i would look for support groups in your area they are free and can be quite helpful always make sure you follow up with your doctor and let them know whats going on too there are also websites and chatrooms for people with mental illnesses where you can have a safe place to vent open up and seek support of others that actually can relate to your situation and struggles also its helpful to have hobbies to distract bad thoughts and try to do the things you love as much as possible you can do it! i wish you all the best :),0
i was put on prazosin 2 months ago this medication is a blood pressure medication yet they found it helps some people with nightmares & sleep problems (usually do to ptsd) my dr told me to pay attention to how im feeling while taking it i dont suffer from high blood pressure therefore i had to make sure it wasnt causing low blood pressure i found i couldnt tolerate taking it every day it made me feel worn out & my heart was doing overtime i experimented a little with it now i only take it when i dont have anything important to do the next day taking it daily wasnt working at all for me the longer i took it the more tired i became & eventually my blood pressure was too low it can be a good drug for some people i recommend monitoring your blood pressure & lack of energy i hated it when i took it daily now that i dont take it every night i really love it,1
im more afraid of what desperate person might fall in love with me anybody that would fall for me likely has more issues than i do! :p,0
hi i have been on citalopram and sertraline for severe clinical depression in the past neither added to the quality of life and between them the side effects werent good recently i have been made reundant and also threatened with homelessness all within a month my anxiety and depression is through the roof my gp suggested i try an snri instead of the usual ssri he put me on venlaflaxine for both anxiety and depression after 3 weeks i feel in a much better place and apart from a mild headache during the first week i have had no side effects at all and that includes in the area of your life that ssris usually spoil ,1
i follow this page and i really hope these "take your meds" post help you all i for one cant stand the pills im given they repress my emotions and make me feel "not me",1
its definitely not 100% preventable  way to make people feel even worse about themselves and more guilty,0
oh this is why i feel like im dead sometimes great way to make us feel miserable lol but this is true thats why numbness is the worst feeling youll ever get when you have depression,0
let him go its not worth more stress in your life i no its hard but with time we move on,0
this is how i feel and wish i didnt have to go through this i feel ashamed to be depressed sometimes,0
yes and no when first diagnosed with depression sad  and adhd i was put on meds for all three at the same time longggg story short it wasnt until many months later that i realized the anxiety meds did nothing for me and that the regular frequent and increasing dosage was why my grades tanked that spring although i had asked previously and was told otherwise i found out that the benzo was giving me memory loss and preventing me from retaining new info i was in vet school at the time obviously such side effects create more anxiety for me! i spent the next year off and on each med trying to figure out what the heck was happening dealing with depression and panic attacks along the way found a new doctor after concluding it wasnt getting better without meds new doctor she thinks my anxiety and depression may actually stem from not controlling my adhd we have been 10 months in now for just adhd meds without anxiety or depression meds not quite perfect yet but better than where i was if i could afford more therapy sessions with the psychologist i think i would be much much better and if i could get out of my living situation (the environment has triggers that would not be tolerable for healthy people at times),1
its without a doubt one of the better ones ive had been on it since 2008 and found it very effective,1
i think i keep saying the wrong thing and/or over burdening people that dont know me very welli am open and genuine ~ but i think that may be misread i feel pretty awful and guilty if i have made them feel worse! also for some i once knew/knew me as friends and colleagues just seem to think ignoring me was/is the best option which i thought was a bit harsh and cold hearted especially given the fact they know my mental health is in flux and they are mhps!?!pretty sure some other former colleagues would not have acted in the same way if they knewi did not expect to be treated in such a wayi am aware that when i was high i was spewing out stuff all over the placebut surely if they understand anything about bipolar disorder they would not find that a good enough reason to treat me like the shit they must scrape of their shoe ~ major disappointment! i feel guilty/ashamed/ embarrassed for trying to communicate at all i wish i had just remained silent which is my usual coping mechanism when i go to ground but being high totally overrides your self control and inhibition which has obviously upset/annoyed/pissed off and disgusted some folksfeeling so despondent and isolated at this point ,0
if that is the combination that works ok but injectible abilify? you can take that orally it is a horrible drug; i personally had bad reactions to it at the forefront was akathisia lamotrigine didnt do anything for me clonazepam helped anxiety for awhile but stopped working so did xanax i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder the combination that ends up working for me is 450 mg lithium carbonate er and 100 mg sertraline for some reason yes my body needs an ssri everyones biochemistry is different unfortunately it takes "playing the medication game" a few times before finding the right combination of medication this really does seem like overkill but i am not the doc either also it really depends on if youre functioning and happy if you are youre in the right place for now!,1
its the most dangerous part of being bipolar you can bring it down and manage it with seroquel and lagactil and other medications its hard to control your self and you can loose a lot of friends great creativity but often it just feels like you are busy but you do not actually get anything done not that i have tried these drugs but i think its like being on lsd and cocaine at once yes we like it yes we manage it when you see that look of horror in other peoples eyes when you are talking to them with manic pressured speech give them some space and take a little extra medication to come down,0
so am i and im slowing dieing inside i wish everyday my heart would just stop beating in my sleep my family just dont know how to deal with it or have their own opinions about me i dont wish this on anyone but it they could experience this for a least one minute maybe they could have a little compassion complex ptsd acid reflux anxity panic attacks copd dealing with this alone and been reaching out for help from drs and give me anti depressants and anxity meds none work anxity meds make me to groggy so i dont take them i cant work like this so i have no income trying to survive physically mentally and financially getting worse where im giving up hope to keep looking for the right dr im exhausted and wore out,1
i deal for a jear with high leveloff anxiety my doc tell me take xanax but i have the taken high doses :( and i dont whant it pfff,1
alarms on my phone,0
i struggle all the time ,0
yeah this was also one of the most expensive films to make and was what ended kevin costners career was horrible,0
youve just said it in one sentencewrite keep writing an learning bout how to manage what your goin through i have all of the above an a 9 yr old son with autism i write poetry to raise awareness for mental health an for my son an all it is my life on day to day basis made into poems great for anxiety also ive just started to do 2 min meditation of mornin that helps me stay calm in situations i usually cant handle hope things get better for you ,0
its a living hell going through panic attact thay just come on with no warning if you ant had one then you dont know wot these people go through as i do as ive said its s living hell,0
im not sure it works in the uk but i use cbd oil for anxiety it has tons of heath benefits including anti anxiety but is also used commonly for children with epilepsy and other illnesses it is extracted from cannabis but theres no thc content so no head high or anything,1
do not worry my friend ive been to hell and back and always learned something about myself ill be going back to school to get my degree never thought id be able to do that you can do anythingand i mean it good luck and god bless!,0
feeling right now to the point my oldest yelled at me "i hate you youre not my mom and you never were" i wish i could explain the uncontrollable thoughts in my head why i cry b/c they hurt explain why i need space before i do worst how to explain to a 7yo(almost 8) didnt even want to leave home to go to work but im here now and i dont want to do anything but cry,0
i think much of of this fear and loathing is based on the horrible stigma of mental illness i hate being bipolar also but we have a sickness that people professionals included and science know so little about so we are poisoned with medication to survive in an unwelcoming world like lepers,0
it has for me ive had a falloff because change of meds for anxiety re stepping back onto it before i managed to lose 15kg just by controlling my calories i am back where i started however i know its possible using fitness pal to track all you eat is essential and helpful also big motivator to curb snacking on high calorie foods :),1
i myself am bipolar and so was my ex we both had two opposite reactions when we were having "off days" he wouldnt want to be alone where i hate being bothered we ended up not working out because when i wanted to be alone hed nag me and get mad because i would go to another room it eventually got to the point hed corner me and id start panicking if that would happen hed start spitting in my face and slapping me abuse isnt a relationship if someone loved you he wouldnt put his hands on you i stayed with my ex way longer than i needed to i stayed until it was life or death if i was you id get out of the relationship you can love someone but your life is way more important than to be abused by them,0
i get a heavy chest when anxiety and panic start,1
this is my 3 rd day taking these and im getting restless legs and very agitated is this normal and will it go away ? x,0
wellbutrin is an upper made my anxiety kick into overdrive too often my bipolar is much more manic than depressive then the valium throws your body back the other way the body is constantly trying to find balance bc those 2 drugs together pull the body different ways,1
depression/anxietyseasonal depression would love to connect with others that really get the struggle,0
same here for me its hard because being diagnosed almost 2yrsi still havent come to terms with it and living in a society where once the words mental illness are mentioned words like mad crazy and nuts come to mindi must admit im a bit ashamed so i basically struggle on my own  ive stopped going to the doctor and taking any meds most day are good but then the lows come and i fight to feel better its​ exhausting the thoughts of suicide it there most days and to ease that invisible pain i need a physical pain  i use to cut or scratch my arm i bit a littleit soothes me  oh my i really needed to share so freeing,0
as far as keeping your ducks in a row you need to keep a notebook write down info about meds moods etc whatever is relevant to you itll help a lot and for support id suggest joining a few bipolar support groups on facebook its amazingly helpful to have a group of people who understand your struggles best wishes to you xxx,1
those can be very stressful environment- do not suggest there,0
having a mental illness is a hell of a battle i have depression and anxiety,1
theres never a testimony without a test god will turn your mess into a message a setback is a setup for a comeback you must not turn your back on god lots of people wonder why they are stuck in certain situations but god really does mend your brokenness no matter how bad the situation gets you ought to praise god no matter what you have to believe that the works of the enemy will be exposed and destroyed focus on the good in your life pray do your best and dont worry about the rest,0
i use to do this for those reasons rub the scares when i get upsetpromised i wouldnt do it anymore,1
maybe have this person read about your disorders and explain an every day situation so they have examples tell them how you are when youre upset (like saying things you dont mean waiting for a reaction maybe punching a wall) and give them a little advice on how they can help in the situation and the easiest way to prevent a problem in the future between you two,0
you have anxiety so bad sweetie! dont worry about those shadowy figures they cant hurt you only scare you thats what they want remember that has your doc ever prescribed you any anti anxiety meds? just tell those shadows to beat it you have more power than they do as a member of the living,1
this may be a stupid answer but how can you not remember i take mine 3 times a day morning as soon as i get up 2 pm and 10 pm my body tells me when too if im late will start acting crazy and severe panic attacks hope this helps,1
i have bp2 mdd and general anxiety i dont take meds for the anxiety because i dont like the feeling i use breathing teqniques meditation listen to music (like when im on the bus) and some yoga to keep things under control my therapist also has recomended tapping and body relaxation though i havent tried it,1
my son is 12 and takes buspar for anxiety you only take it as needed and his doc had no problems prescribing it i want to give you my 2 cents i am definitely not against medication!! i take several and so does my 12 year old but be very very aware of the side effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics!! i see a lot of suggestions in the comments for fairly heavy duty psych meds and i feel you only want to take those as a last resort!! seroquel and remeron so on etc etc are serious meds and i have been on them as an adult and would never put my child on them unless he had actual psychosis! they are both huge weight gainers that effect the metabolism you dont want to start messing with his metabolism so young they also are extremely sedating and not just at night! they can have a big zombie effect! they also mess with the bodies ability to control its core temperature they are also linked to severe oral issues (rotten brittle teeth etc) obviously if you have to have meds then you have to have meds but make sure you study any drug before letting him start taking it,1
you are awesome for not letting her illness scare you off and even more awesome for being willing to do what you can to help her,0
i also have night terrors,1
i have ptsd depression anxiety and a handful of other mental illnesses also have scoliosis and a fcked up spine i get up every day take care of a 5&2 yr old plus go to work its all abt gettin out there n doin it bc u have to n not living off the govt they wont give u disability for a mental illness not unless ur brain dead or are mentally handicapped thats jst how disability works if u can walk talk then u can wrk the govt doesnt see mental illnesses as a disability,1
i have reoccurring nightmares about mine all the time & have bpd with anxiety & depression its rough needed this thanks,1
i want to stay on my medicine the doctor is suggesting i come off through this process or i wont reach my potential and coming off medicine is scary i been on it 12 yrs,0
weight gain on latuda i only took it for 6 weeks while in the hospital  i was extremely tired but was also on depicote and clonazepam saw my doctor after i was released and he put me on back on my old meds zoloft clonazepam doxipen remeron and lamictal im been tipping and a bit manic due to be back in the real world and daily stress but i have coping skills a tool box phone coaching therapy and a great network of support,1
this resonated with me you really helped me just now im close to the edge and im seriously scaring myself,0
hey thereyou will do great! i was terrified too and i did make some notes to bring with me but for my assessment they basically went through my history from when i started having trouble so you could make some notes on that esp if youre anxious but in my experience they are very understanding and make you feel at ease you will definitely feel better afterward and they can figure out if your diagnosis is accurate they can also help you learn to control the urges when you understand where they are coming from remember the beginning is the scariest part and youve worked for this appointment youll do fine!!,0
go see a counselor on campus or make an appointment with a psych doctor in your area its normal to struggle when you make a big change in your life (like starting college) but if it starts to interfere with your ability to live life--as this clearly is--you shouldnt be ashamed to get help please reach out and get professional help i was scared when i first did but they are honestly there to help you,1
i was only on small doses and i had to stop because i fell asleep at the wheel of my car the drowsiness was extreme i couldnt function i was irritable but i put that down to my bipolar not being stable meds react with different people in different ways,1
he needs a good psychiatrist the most proven med for depression and anxiety on the market for kids is fluxotene,1
nope i will not be ashamed of my emotions,0
anxiety over fixing my hair pushed me to shave mine im glad i did i actually love it lol,0
i take seroquel to stop the manias and lagactil which is an old drug epilim is better than lithium as it does not strain the kidneys,1
no worries ,0
im bipolar and im having a hard time on new med seraquel its causing light headedness dizzy spells and nausea iv been taking for about 10 weeks cant wait to go to the physciatrist its hard to get in but im going for a walk in this monday to have them changed im also taking clonzapin thats not helping my anxiety has anybody had a problem with seraquel,1
he just upped my anti-depressant last week they arent upping my lithium because the salt makes me constantly thirsty and i am a heart patient and have a fluid restriction ive tried every other drug and theyre either bad for my heart or they have horrible side effects the therapy im learning is supposed to help with bpd but they said it will be really hard and take a lot of time to change my behavior,0
paul david has written books that help with anxiety they are really helpfully cbt is really good too i wish you well ☺,1
when i was on lamictal i took it with cymbolta lithium is ok right now im on respidone for bpd with buspirone for anxiety,1
thank you thats one of my biggest struggles im like this but not depressed :/,0
i understand what you mean i go through stages that i dont want to be here anymore and be pain free sometimes i dont want to die i just dont want too exist sometimes i want to die then i have times where i think about dying and once youre dead thats it youre gone forever and my stomach turns and i freak out so much!! its a horrible feeling but i just cant help when it happens and stop thinking about it x,0
i have almost all of these symptoms doubt i have bpd though anger issues run on my family and the rest can be connected to depression anxiety and having everyone except family abandon you after some time since childhood,0
its ok to grieve and to go through a grieving stage it doesnt mean you wont get out of it dont be automatically afraid of that that said volunteering at a hospital or animal shelter may help motivate you especially since people will be expecting you to show up so you will have to get out of bed,0
to be ill is to be holistically affected in both neurons or nervous tissue and somatic tissue as the brain influences not only itself but the holistic physique the head including the whole self sure neurons and somatic cells differ from one another but the neurons are in control over the somatic cells the forebrain first begins to appear together with the heart in the human embryo at three weeks both brain and heart are connected by the vagus nerve,1
seroquel is the weight killer when i was on it i had gained over 120 pounds in just under 2 and a half years since i switched doctors and this 1 took me off of that dreaded pill and switched me to topamax i have since lost 96 of those pounds and also feel better too topamax is also fda approved as a weight loss aid as it does not slow the metabolism down like most psychotropic drugs in its class,1
the lamictal is a good long term preventative for depression but not so good short term- have you tried a mood stabilizer like tegretol or lithium or do you have just depression? due to recent law changes prescriptions for potentially addictive drugs like sleep meds and anxiety meds now are strictly controlled and they just do not give as many of them maybe you need an antidepressant as well,1
i have the same issue my old dr moved away and the new one doesnt get why after 10 years he had me on vicodin and xanax because nothing else worked trial and error of psych meds nearly killed me more than once i cant take ibuprofen or gabapentin due to pancreatitis but new dr is so worried about them being addictive and high risk for resale if my old doc trusted me for so many years with never missing a follow up test and never asking for more or higher doses why not give me what we knew works?!,1
and sometimes the cracks show so every one can see the pain in my leg was so bad i fell an hit my head never had problems with it before the doctor says its my anxiety playing up and im feeling pain where there is none ,0
battle a lot even with a zopac every night i struggle,0

mania is ok until i end up completely paranoid and psychotichearing voices and seeing things are not welcome additions to my mania,0
the moods are fairly stable compared to usual its the overwhelming amount of fatigue that im dealing with my memory isnt great anymore and of course the pain,0
depikote sucks honestly havwnt taken it in years  and khlonopin 1 mgs for anxiety,1
suicide is never ok its unfortunate that our minds get so desperate to relieve ourself from what ever it is where going threw that we are tricked into thinking this is the answer perhaps its your answer but that doesnt make it ok theres nothing ok with a life being taken even if its your own your taking,0
i had the same issue with my boyfriend - i had written in my journal about what one day was like for me - from the time i woke up to the time i fell asleep (if i even fell asleep) i wrote a stream of thought about what goes through my mind and went into detail about what gives me anxiety and my daily interactions where i have to act like im susie sunshine because thats what people expect of me so by the time i get home i am too exhausted to even think yet my mind still goes and i wrote another stream of thought - when i wrote it i had no intention of sharing it with anybody - but i got to a point where i was tired of him resenting me and telling me i was just making excuses - so i read it to him and something finally clicked in him - sometimes he will get angry - and i dont blame him for that - being with someone with a mental illness is frustrating - but his demeanor has changed a tremendous amount - i also told him what i felt he could do to help me in those situations he is not perfect but things have improved so much,0
latuda made me question life and gave me incredible anxiety tried topamax but hated the side effects im bipolar 2 so i think im wanting to try a single medicine therapy ive been reading on it and i would love to just take seroquel at night,0
some great advice here there are times in life that we can cope with our anxiety because we strategically avoid situations that trigger said anxiety you have obviously reached a point where this is now not working for you please take the advice given so far and visit a psychiatrist for some help your doctor should be able to refer you or make a recommendation ~vw~,1
i dont think it is a good thing to bring religion on this page as it is too contentious i cant say what i really think as it would upset people,0
lol i had to laugh but its so not funny living like that on a regular!! so dysfunctional and irritating!! especially when youve been you doctors medication guinea pig for several years and still no progress!! then they wonder why the only time i leave the house is to when i have to do something for my kids,1
its nice from you to seek advice i believe there are different levels or severity of bipolar but at the end we all deal with the same monster also it can be mixed with anxiety depression add adhd some can function and some cannot its like not knowing how you are going to feel tomorrow or 3 hours from now,1
every cell and every organ of your body depend on serotonin your body supply will have to regulate and you can not expect this to happen overnight how long have you been on paxil? i think the very best advice is to work with your physician to taper it down very gradually make sure you are hydrated really well and eat a good diet some of the symptoms can be very difficult to cope with when i went off it abruptly it sounded like a freight train or a car going by every time i turned my head evidently very tiny structures in your brain have to equalize and it takes time look up sites that advise about tapering off medications because those are written realistically by people who know what it is really like there are pharmacists who can compound the paxil to a gradually lower and lower dose it can take months i recently went down on my dose of effexor and depakote i would say to be really good about stress during this time prepare yourself for rough relationships really welllike seeing an x there are long term impacts from these medications that medical science is finding out a pill enters our entire body we want to be as cognizant of the side effects as possible prescribers will not ask you if you have them! they wont even usually do the right tests the physicians and the psychiatrist draw a line in concrete concerning what is each of their jobs weaning takes time so there is not a rapid return of depression and anxiety and you dont get the withdrawal symptoms,0
i like that look of terror in their eyes let the manipulation begin,0
effexor worked for a while then it lost its edge so ended up on valium with it as well for short time but now i just end up taking a 150 in the morning and a 150 in the afternoon it helps me get through the day  but only just ive anger general anxiety disorder and depression been on various meds now for nearly 10 years  since i got diagnosed with cancer  cancers gone but the mental issues that came with it still remain,1
what about counselling or psychology? she is at an age where she may be responsive to someone outside of the family unit and share in her current story with the hope of creating a different story for herself with hope passion and goal setting i wish you both so much joy and happiness dont hesitate to ask me any questions i work as a psychologist with adolescents and know there is so much hope ,1
 always happends to me for the most part i blame the fibro fog because of the fibromyalgia i have but it isn very risky and annoying when i cant remember if i took my antidepressants or no to ,0
omg! the struggle is real,0
i absolutely understand where your coming from your definitely not alone in this one there are very few people that i actually make calls to regularly & its because they are dealing with similar issues to me so they understand me & i find them not only easy to talk to but theyre a huge support (we are supportive to each other) anyone else i speak to on the phone either call me or im calling them back they all understand this is how i am & how i need it to be i think the main reason im not good at calling people is the fact that its exhausting! having to explain how i am what ive been up to (if i can even remember) what treatments im currently having (meds etc) if its all working for me & what my doctor thinks or says? sometimes they just want to know everything & its tiring! also knowing that some of the people im speaking to dont really understand what im dealing with can be frustrating but still i have to remember that they are trying theyre making an effort they want to keep in contact because they are trying to understand & they care i have to remember that its a good thing & i do have to acknowledge respect & love them for that sometimes i do just text them a short message though its easier for me when im not feeling my best & i can control the details that i want to go into theyve learned to accept this about me & i guess any contact is better than no contact right? in the end for me theres no right or wrong way when it comes to contacting my family members & friends i need to feel comfortable & somewhat understood by the people im speaking to & they need to understand that sometimes i dont want to talk about my issues ill just quickly let them know how im doing & that now id rather talk about something else our world doesnt have to constantly revolve around our illness especially when were speaking to family just because we feel its expected sometimes its nice to have a conversation that doesnt involve my illness i really hope that ive helped you & not confused you further,0
unfortunately all too often it is such a horrible feeling and i can never make it go away :(,0
im also bipolar wit depression & anxiety,1
i have ssdi for bipolar i that was diagnosed 25 years ago i have had multiple hospital stays 5150s 5250s last time i was manic i got arrested twice for suspicion of being on meth they threw me in jail instead of taking me to mental health dumb ass cops but i digress ive also had a lot of health problems i guess it was just the combination of everything that got me approved on the first try that is the exception and not the rule though most people get denied 3 times and end up having to go to court its a long haul,1
i havent worked since november of last year we lost our home and had to move with my parents my hubby and two kiddos work is extremely stressful and anxiety provoking i have ptsd from work i applied for ssdi i am waiting my decision to see if we need to appeal,1

im awful at remembering to take mine i miss one day and im a mess i miss two and i am completely unable to function anxiety induced rage is so awful,0
its the harsh truth for some people it makes the fight easier for others not so much if your therapist is a good one they told you for a reason for me personally knowing its just a part of my brain and not a part of who i am as a person was extremely helpful i know when to reach out when it gets too difficult to handle myself because i will always have them and thats okay better to learn how to handle it rather than making it a constant struggle to fix it,0
for me it depends on the person texting/calling i see the number or name and panic most times i just dont answer i have a few hard calls to make in a couple of hours been up all night worrying,0
i have bpd (borderline personality disorder) diagnosed 10yrs ago its a struggle everyday there are no mess for it but dbt (dialectical behavior therapy )really helps it has been the only thing that seems to help along with regular therapy,1
im bipolar with depression and anxiety i take klonapin (sp) it works really well it isnt as strong as xanax but it does its job unfortunately my dr doesnt like using it long term so i am working with her on finding something else that will work i also suffer from anxiety related insomnia and it helps me relax and sleep,1
seroquel made me anxious even at low doses,0
its not that im thinking of killing myself when i have these thoughts its that i get scared thinking about how im going to die and what death is like,0
get help hun try not to stress and tackle one thing at a time or you will be overwhelmed,1
in my opinion get off the seroquel that shit is so bad for your brain i found it made everything in my life worse harder to deal with emotions harder to control my mood swings have me memory loss and caused me to stutter the only thing it helped me with was sleep and even then i was seeing shit and hearing shit in my sleep i wouldnt recommend it for anyone my uncle has schizophrenia and bipolar and i even told him to get off the shit hes 50% better than he was on it i highly recommend mertazapine for an anti anxiety/anti depressant as i to have tried many different one and this has worked the best for me i have little to no anxiety most days everyone who ive told to try this have all had major turn around and good results everyone is different with medications but i think its worth a try goodluck,1
i have bipolar 1 and anxiety ive been married 31 years and can tell you nothing is easy i tell my wife that i love her the best way i know how but sometimes i just suck at loving i think the part about feeling nothing for someone is more a part of the disorder than real emotions when i get to feeling apathetic in my heart i use my brain my logic to reason with my self that i care deeply for those i love im 51 years old and i think fighting lessens with age i also dont believe there is one perfect person were supposed to be with the question to ask is "is he a decent guy?if i had a grown daughter would i want her to be with a guy like this?" if so then probably a guy worth fighting for remember that you are a person worthy of love regardless of some diagnosis some doctor gave you be the best version of youokay i think that last part i saw on that show the office but you get the gist best of luck,0
yes i work full time for a general surgeon work out is my escape - pulg in my head phones and blast my music i am married with two small children so yes i do support a family i may add my husband has a tbi and ptsd so im the only one who works not much family support as i dont talk to anyone about it because of my husbands own issues look im sorry if i am able to handle anxiety and depression without medications not everyone needs medicine what is with bashing people who can self manage? usually thats a good thing,1

bonnie-lee guilty ,0

if your anxiety is the innate generalized anxiety disorder (free-floating anxiety) type you can blame gene slc6a4 which codes for anxiety related disorder,1
counselormy gp doesnt handle any of this i asked for anxiety meds and they dont want to do it till the lamictal starts doing its job but its not doing anything and my breakdowns are getting worse i dont know why they arent helping me i am making my next prescriber appt next week and gonna keep trying,1
contrary to what people are saying about him not being the one i can say from experience that its not necessarily true my boyfriend never understood depression or anxiety until i started sharing material with him endless material about others experiences whether they share my disabilities or have something else the mighty has plenty of articles that are well written and relateable if hes willing to read and learn and most of all listen continue to try! we also started couples therapy at 2 years and it has really helped him see how much he relies on me while hes away at work and just how big my heart is how much work i do w his kid and just how hard i struggle every day to get up and get by if theres a system and a way to help him see there is hope however if he isnt willing to try to learn to listen to talk to help and understand then thats when you need to walk away for your own well being,1
it took me a long time to sleep last night it was my anxiety ,1
that depends on your individual disability for me she helps with my c-ptsd depression and bipolar i trained her to help by watching my back so no one can spook me she alerts and responds to my raising anxiety interrupts depressive episodes and responds to rising manic episodes,1
melissa whitehead im so happy! im currently struggling with severe anxiety and low moods and i know others are struggling just as much as i am so its important we keep each other strong and ready to face another day ☺️ ,0
i mean im all about a second opinion but my actual dr said it most likely is bipolar and the meds seem to be helping  minus the insomnia and horribly vivid dreams,1
what youre experiencing is called a mixed state i experience them too although ive got type 2 bipolar it can be really tough but ive experienced episodes of it where i function well considering everything thats happening in my head other times i really struggle its really difficult to explain unfortunately,0
this is me right now struggling a lot and my only respite is sleep ,1
i completely understand but hate the shame or embarrassment i feel after,0
i havent tried many things but i know that lavender helps with anxiety and stress,1
yes i can see no reason why not mental illness doesnt equate to danger or misery being an arsehole on the other hand will gauruntee misery,1
i went through a trauma in 2011 and had to wait months before i could actually admit that something was wrong and then open up to mental health professionals about what happened i havent told anyone other than my current mental health nurse exactly what happened to the full extent - and it still haunts me even though ive been through emdr for ptsd - but i have convinced myself over several years to be more open about how im feeling and how things are affecting me if you can find a good therapist or mental health nurse you trust and try to open up to them even if its just a little bit at a time its important to get things off your chest so you dont hold on to all that stress and cause horrible damage to yourself like stomach ulcers and cysts,0
i dont recommend serequil way too may side effects effexor (venlafaxine) worked great also really helped with my severe anxiety i had no adverse reaction take it it helped me,1
everyday is a struggle try to keep your mind occupied hobbies or a job with lots of ot thats how i get by,0
a constant struggle with myself no meds anymore im getting by  by the grace of god,0
i would never wish my illness "bpd" on my worst enemy! im daily struggling and fighting my negative thoughts with positive ones and once i do tht i feel tht i have given into the negative because now i feel i cant change this spiral but instead have incouraged it my thoughts consume the way i feel on the outside i feel tht im constantly chasing the good days i recently had before to make me feel better instead of feeling lost bpd is never a cure bc it differs from one day to the next and can change at any moment and anything can trigger it,0
lucy mcgowan thank you! i have been in counseling since i was 12 it helps but not the same as having another that has been through similar situationyea my jobs used to last 6 months at the most and then id quit!!! as i have gotten older the anxiety has gotten worse i try to deal with it the best i can but sometimes it gets the best of me!!!,1
lamictal!!!! latuda made me a horrible person,0
as far as me (since it is completely different for everyone) i have been on 900 mgs of seroquel when i was really bad in highschool for 6 months and functioned great i mean it put me out immediately so i only took it at night but the next day i was as normal as possible it made me gain weight quickly currently i am only on 75 of seroquel and only take more if its an emergency and i just need to sleep through it cymbalta i was on it for around 7 years until it became useless to me after brain chemistry changes it helped keep me stable and was good for my depression i assume it helped with my overall anxiety and ocd not sure though,1
sorry to hear this! look into using therapeutic grade essential oils such as plant therapy or young living oils they help with a bunch of different things- anxiety sleep pain etc good luck!!,1
depression is hard really hard but when you have over active mind and brain which is powerful generator of thought and so anxiety you feel like you run so much so fast that you are dying from exhaustion but still are ruining! it is just,0
noi suffer from anxietyand clinical depressioni live with itand it would very hard to be involved with someone who has same problem,0

im prescribed 2mg xanax 3 times daily helps my anxiety and im able to sleep im just really depressed due to the loss of my lil bro on the 4th of july he was only 34 and had wife and 2 kids service this saturday and im an emotional wreck,0
i have bi polar and the best decision ive made is to take the pills they help control the raging fire inside but i dont have anxiety or sddepression so the meds might not work as well or even make it worse,1
it took me 3 weeks to settle of course the first few weeks you go right down as in you become the worst you never thought possible after that i found it helped me manage my anxiety attacks better and with the help of a lot of therapy i managed to control when i had them a lot of the time i never relied on the pill as i need to put the work in to help myself also but it did help me when i was learning how to control myself,1
is there one for depression and anxiety ?,1
are you on any medication currently? i have found that certain tablets can cause very vivid upsetting dreams,1
ive been taking ambien for a long time now so i guess i have worked through a lot of the odd things yes you will forget things you did sometimes the stuff you did shortly before you took it too it gives me the munchies too its almost amusing when you find out what you ate last night sucks when it hits hard and you have a glass of milk in your hand i never seem to forget that feeling ever i dont sleep i dont get tired i was wide awake at 2am last night still and am back up at 7am im not currently manic either this is me but without help with sleep i wont sleep at all and the mania comes on to scary levels,1
trouble is when you feel anxious almost all of those things are impossible to do anyway!!!,0
my mother is i have a cousin who is as well i was diagnosed with mdd major depressive disorder and anxiety but always wondered myself but also cant stand labels am who i am try not to let it define me as a person i would say my depression has severely gotten worse since my grandfather died in 2008 not only was he a grandfather he was like a dad i never had and a best friend all in one to this day i still have hard time getting through it and going on without him he was one of the very few relatives i was close to and seemed to genuinely care about me,0
please dont smoke weed your paranoia would go through the roof xx this is from someone who knows,0
im not terrified of it being a possibility because i know its true,0
lithium isnt safe! my dr refused to use lithium while i was pregnant because of too many risks said if i wanted to go that direction i have to sign a waiver stating i know the risks because thats not something he practices i couldnt do it i understand being stable trust me its an everyday battle for everyone but never in a million years would i stay on treatment and risk the life of my child its a small window of time to not be on meds with the right support you can get through without meds you just have to know what support you really need and different meds do different things during different phases of pregnancy ive been on some that are safer after first trimester and ive been on some that were only safe during the first trimester,0
dont worry ladies i have just booted her from the page she wont be back ❤ ~dani,0
i have type 2 with anxiety im on zoloft and lithium,0
same diagnosis as you im usually stable but this shaking was strange,0
so sad and yet so true i am alone in my struggles,0
i understand how u feel i have my highs & lows while on 300mg zoloft pluse 9 mg valium and neulactil 4 a day  any emotional event can cause having lows i have trouble getting out bed as i feel when ur sleeping u feel no emotions i used to smoke a bit of canabis to help me stay calm but had heart attack cartiac arrest & stoped canabis so i find i struggle more without it im in process getting my meds changed due to weight gain im dreading it cos i dont cope at all  i hope u start feeling better soon just talk to ur dr about ur medication it might need to be increased  x,0

depends what stage they are in and what their situation is i personally when elated am very irritable and have a short fuse but in time u learn to control it more and more ,0
unfortunately getting the right dose and playing lab rat sometimes is needed to find the right meds at the right doses it took me 18 mths to find that lithium mirtazapine and olanzapine worked for my bipolar i and anxiety i know all to well the limbo you feel you need to speak with your psychiatrist and tell them how you feel open honest communication is key i keep a mood journal and practice cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness there are plenty of resources on the web and mindfulness apps for your phone take care,1
i lost my job due to my mental health so my husband walked out he said i was a lazy sponger he doesnt understand what it is to feel so hopeless but i suppose i only have myself to worry about now,0
some forms of acne cannot be cured without prescription meds i have cystic acne which was really irritated by my bi-polar meds go to a dermatologist it usually only takes one visit to get it fixed please dont give up on yourself because it is something so temporary ,1
i have terrible anxiety and thunderstorms calm me disappointed cuz i was hoping to sleep to one tonight they always put me right to sleep and never wake up ,1
the biggest thing that i know to avoid for us is any of the artificial sweeteners they break down into some nasty chemicals that do not react well with our brains i have been struggling with my appetite so it has been very hard to me to be interested in eating at all but i do so much better on a well balanced diet especially if i can grab a quick snack of veggies or fruit through out the day but like i said i have no appetite so finding anything to get me to eat is hard and that makes the symptoms roar,0
perfectly normal! when i would spend stays in the hospital and then get released i would do a bit of nesting make one room my comfort area start slow and and let my living space grow dont overwhelm yourself,0
i think a lot of times parents have a hard time accepting their child has mental health issues because they feel like it is their fault or they are being blamed or like they did something wrong so they will try to deny or ignore things like this also it is hard to understand what someone else is going through unless you walk a mile in their shoes so to speak i have bipolar and anxiety issues etc i had a close family member tell me that they never believed anxiety attacks were real until they had one their self that same family member got on medication and never told me about it i think she was embarrassed because she had secretly judged me for so long and it was too hard for her to admit that she was wrong,0
wow! i hope everyone that knows me takes the time to really read and think about what you read this is what i struggle with on a daily basis however with the god and the wonderful support group i have it does make like alot easier,0
if you feel you should go and are unsure go it will be okay they will elvaluate you and make the appropriate decision have someone drive you if you dont have a ride call a crisis number for your area or just dial 911 please be safe and let us know you are okay i have been where you are many times,0
see my kids know when im being serious and when im just being an irritable ass,0
sounds like you could hav bipolar 2 and going through hypomania episode but i wouldnt consider what you describe as being full blown mania as you are very aware of what you are doing and during a mania persons lack of insight into their behaviour and believes it is appropriate within given situation when it is very obvious that is isnt to other people mania doesnt equal feeling good happy or on top of the world which many people are saying here - you can feel like that but characteristics are lowering of inhibitions impulsive reckless and sometimes dangerous behaviour or placing yourself in dangerous situations feeling invincible really uncontrollably excitable energetic or agitated irritability racing thoughts anxiety thinking you know things other people dont paranoid beliefs psychotic symptoms include receiving special messages believing you are special powers etc having said that if you go through cycling moods every few weeks you should see dr as this more like bp2,0
yes the shame is the worst i have lost my wife and children because of it! i live alone in fear of being with anyone now,0
i find if you have a panic attack it normally happens when you start focusing on yourself the fear if you have a fidget toy play a game in your phone and shift your focus i find it not as bad as for the rest finding balance with your doctors needs and therapy is definitely,1
id avoid this i highly doubt you will be better off the government is also making it more difficult maybe consider fmla to get therapy and assistance with coping it is very hard to get ssi,1
perhaps both are true maybe your memory has been altered due to time and the deep emotions that go with something like this and they also dont want all you say to be true because its shameful and it hurts the truth is likely somewhere in the middle i think in making peace if you took the position that you were a child and some of the memories could be a little skewed however insisting that nevertheless it has certainly contributed to your current state this might be a better place to start reconciliation anywaythats my two centsgod bless you,0
leave the meds to the psych just tell all of your concerns of your illness anyone who walks in and starts asking for certain meds sends an alarm off in the mind of your doctor that is what is called drug seeking behavior the doctor is then more likely to reduce your meds no matter how much you may need them once that type of behavior is marked down in your chartwell you see the problem,1
because it helps most if not all my symptoms from bipolar and adhd and as more and more data and research surfaces its showing to be a lot safer and much less side effects then pretty much anything from the pharmacy i still take lithium and adderall but smoking keeps me happy and functioning the psycho active properties stimulate my brain during depressivecycles but it also keeps me pretty calm and clear headed when i get manic if im having a panic attack/break hitting a bowl will either pull me completely out of it or bring me down enough that my other coping mechanisms can now be used effectively as for the adhd it really controls the impulsive thoughts and lets me get really into a paper im writing or a song im learning on piano rather then constantly needing new stimuli and moving on after 5 minutes,1
stay in the moment dont worry for now 99% of worry doesnt happen all the best x,0
actually in behavioural therapy you slowly work your way up to more and more exposure to things that cause anxiety while you are exposed to your anxiety causing trigger or situation your therapist helps you practice coping skills to deal with situation the better you get at coping and the more positive outcomes you have during these exercises the less anxiety you will feel combine this with the proper medication and it can make a world of difference,1
thanks for the share never feel ashamed to be doing what is best for you and know you will win the battle,0
ive read a lot of posts but i eventually cried over yours and i began to feel sick to my stomach that i had nothing rightful to say to you in the moment so i shut my phone and ran an errand got my composure back and me back and eventually returned to you i think you have to call upon your son and open up write a list first of whats wrong and then give it to him to process you must give your son an open door to possibly collaborate to help you it would be absolutely cruel of you to take your life without giving him a chance to earnestly help you hes your son he loves you more than words ever do second there are people called life coaches this ties in to you wanting to get back to your old self these folks have seen it all nothing to be shy about try it youve got nothing to lose i do happen to believe that serious depression benefits from mood stabilizers since anti depressants can make things way worse talking lithium zonisamide type drugs with a sprinkling of antidepressant and force yourself to write down a list of what you know you enjoy even though you arent doing it share it with your son and the life coach collectively youll gently come up with a plan no more talk of suicide or those thoughts for at least a month just barr them from having any power over you not an option i just gave you a slew of things to do my friend!! xxxx,0
it is possible but if thats not your diagnosis then dont get extra worried about it let the doctor do his job about diagnosis and you work on getting better take your meds and go to therapy if your meds arent working right get an appointment for a change,1
i wouldnt like to judge because ive been in that bad place before but i hope you dont feel pressured into anything seems a bit like he wants more from your relationship dont feel guilted into anything and remember this isnt your responsibility but also try to help in a way that isnt detrimental to your own mental health x x,0
agitation anxiety mania that drug did threw me from depression straight into high level hypomania and mixed states im fairly certain that was the drug that landed me in the hospital,1
dealing with your worst fears and memories is draining maybe your therapist can spend the last 30 min of your sessions teaching you techniques to calm yourself down and change mental gears ❤,1
i was while on risperidone quite disturbing thoughts theyve pretty much gone away since switching to seroquel,0
i totally understand a few months ago i was in the same boat sometimes people can be super sensitive to topical acne treatments salcylic acid breaks me out worse and its usually a first line treatment the only thing that has mostly worked for me is a simple cleanser and moisturizer i use cerave products the gentle cream cleanser and the moisturizing lotion every morning and at night i do the same and use the cerave serum - which has retinol which is good from everything from fine lines to acne be sure to wear sunscreen because it has a tendency to make you burn faster for whatever reason i know youll have an overwhelming amount of responses but just remember sometimes its better to start from scratch also i stopped drinking caffeine and i believe that has helped my skin immensely as well and my anxiety too,1
vitamin d is helpful for mood function and niacin is also supposed to be a great supplement as well fish oil and a regular diet help too! dont be afraid to lower your stress level for your own peace of mind! (cbt and meditation are also amazing check out meditationoasiscom for guided meditations too,1
i have seen four different therapists the third one i made the most progress with but i could tell st the end when i hit a plateau she got frustrated and gave up but the fourth one helped because i was comfortable enough with her to be able to talk about things while im not sure i will ever be 100% comfortable with anyone she helped a lot i guess what im saying is you are not alone and tbat there are others that are or have been in your position i know its hard but give it a fair shot and dont be afraid to get right to the point and tell them that you are hesitant about being there and why it will help them to better help you,0
stay strong and baby steps my anxiety sometimes makes it hard for me to do things too my friends are very protective of me and know about my struggles they always are willing to just be my safe person and when introducing me to new people help me to not shut down,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page thank you you too take care,1
im so sorry i have depression/anxiety and i believe im bp2 i hate my job and want to do something else but have settled for staying with it unitl i just cant do it anymore luckily my wife is very supportive but she wasnt so much last year and the year before she was tired of me and threatened me unless i got help maybe if you could give your husband another chance and talked with him about how you really feel he might be able to be more thoughtful and supportive i hope so,0
it was the first medication i was prescribed after two weeks i was shaking uncontrollably so stopped taking it but everyone is different so give it a try,1

hi fellow canadian here have you tried looking at programs available in your area for people with your illness? i have found we have to be the people who fight for our own health i had to go to a womans clinic and walk in doctors for a year trying to stabilize my bipolar because my doctor got very ill and when i got sick she had just gotten sick as well so i have had to really learn to navigate the system myself its not ideal but i am sure that there is a doctor who can and will listen to you and help you get better also have a full blood screening done you may have a under lying health condition that need proper treatment as they can also effect how your mind feels also if you have bipolar you are taking effexor for depression is not ideal as it can cause mania and that just makes the lows worse i find something to treat the anxiety is better at least thats what my doctor explained to me(i was on previous to treat lows and it made me worse),1
you asked about cymbalta & everyone gives you all this other advice bless themanywaycymbalta has helped me a lot be aware however that coming off of is horrid ive never done hard drugs but it was what i imagined it was like to come off heroin and anyone else who has come off it can tell you the same this also means that if i miss a dose i feel it (brain zaps nausea faint) best of luck to you!! may you feel better very soon,0

im pretty much alone i dont have any close friends anymore and my family doesnt really want anything to do with me im alone 95% of the time and im struggling getting used to it its hard not to have anyone to turn to or talk with,0
i havent actually but i have done some research on it and i agree but im reluctant to say that to a doctor lol my moms a nurse and she told me a long time ago that self-diagnosing is the quickest way to get laughed out of a doctors office im not a hypochondriac though and ive been dealing with unmedicated mental illness long enough to tell the difference between whats real and whats not i really think i could have bpd,0
never freedom of misery,0
that is an amazing description and spot on for me i used to explain the confusion as being placed in a maze having the lights shut off and then being told you have 3 seconds to get out before you die its utter chaos and panic that at times cant be controlled even with medication therapy and coping techniques thank you for sharing!!!,0
a stable life sleep pattern all help stay away from stress / stressful ppl too much is sometimes not good there are loads of side effects check urs change if necessary every case/ person different but just general advice,1

possibly bipolarisms best known symptom is rapid mood swings with little to no warning or reason it would be best to speak with a doctor if you suspect there could be an issue i have a mild form that coexists with depression and anxiety i dont experience the highs (mania) but i do have depressive episodes that come on suddenly with no trigger and they disappear in much the same way,1
describing me to the tthe struggle is real,0
im on 75mg of it currently and i feel like it doesnt really do much of anything but make me more depressed not to mention that ive only ever missed one day of it at it was absolutely horrible i wanted to die,0

terri di mauro to the best of my professional knowledge an rn with 20 years of clinical experience i do not dispute your opinion however i believe that anxiety is included as a diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder i believe that alot of members of these support communities tend to fixate on their multiple diagnosesi have bipolar gad ptsd borderline personality disorder etc mania and depression must coexist in order for the bipolar diagnostic criteria to be satisfied i dont mean to come across but i just wanted to convey the downside of grouping multiple diagnoses together may cause some confusion among its members especially since it is an open group in contrast the bipolar support group is closed,1
your comments give me relief to this aspect of anxiety and gives me hope because i feel that although we feel pain from the social isolation we still persevere thank you for sharing and caring this gives me strength that does not necessarily comes from my medication,0
i do the same thing but my so called dr does not take me serious so i dont know i take benadryl to sleep but the the nightmares are horrible and the next day i am an a hole and a half im at my wits end myself,0
one of my friends calls the physc ward the "crayon box" probably cause you get to color in some of them sometimes it can be peaceful there like a mini vacation people take care of you and you dont have to worry about your problems,0
hope you dont really feel that way i have been depressed and had extreme anxiety my whole life and i know god put me here for a reason i have great memories and future plans please get help you dont have to feel that way,0
dont give upget a good psychologist and learn to manage the mood swings; before being diagnosed (and getting help) i went thru a period of months realizing i didnt have to say more than 12 words a day only to find i could cut it down to six! been depressed for days now but will struggle ondont give up!,0
youre right pills wont cure itknowing that helps because you know to expect good days and bad my anxiety got so bad my dr gave me klonopin which does help but makes me so tired and sleepy i use it very sparingly,1
so then for those of us that do live where it is legalized for medicinal usage and that is all we use does that mean we are excluded from making suggestions or even speaking about to anyone on here or perhaps even others who do? i think thats a bit unfair and it was an incorrect limitation put on the subject/topic matter because there is some value and worth in medical cannabis and just to say why i boldly questioned the limitationi cannot take the chemical medications anymore 20 plus years of doing so as prescribed i now have brain damage due to professional medical treatment i have brain damage i also have brain deterioration i also have tardive diskenesia i gain health issues that were never there because of chemical medications my heart stopped long enough to be declared legally dead but somehow im still here so what about folks like me? do i not have any valuable suggestions because the best suggestion i have with any valuable worth is medical cannabis? i didnt say just cannabis because that would be implied recreational use and thats not what its about it may not be federally legal but according the laws of the states who have passed itits legal my certification says its legal my medical cannabis id card that is state regulated and must be renewed and re-evaluated yearly says its legal the fact that i can sit on my porch and have a county sheriff on the other side of the driveway at someone elses house sees me sitting on my porch smoking it and he smiles nods his head says how are you? gets in his vehicle and drives away while im still on my porch have a toke or twothat also saysits legal so i do beg to differ on your statement that it isnt legal and if you dont like my statements kick me out of the group why? because the entire world should have a toke and chill out on cannabis it also helps me focus it helps my muscles and joints relax and have less tension i also have tourettes syndrome ive had it all of my life it helps my tics because it helps me to relax stress exacerbates my tics even internal stress due to other health issues as well it helps me to deal with severe ptsd issues otherwise i may hurt someone because ive been triggered in a bad state ( i dont want that nobody else does either) helps with my anxiety it calms me down better than an addictive chemical like adavan or xanax or a painkiller which only make me sick which exacerbate all of my health issues more i have so many more health issues than i can list here and so many environmental things right down to the barometric pressure in the air and even that can be quite a task to deal with and manage through it helps me sleep i have been diagnosed with insomnia since i was a kid it helps me to have an appetite i dont eat when im stressed problem is with my internal issues (health issues) and environmental issues that affect my internal issues and ultimately become a vicious circle right back out of me i have a toke or two i calm down and i get hungry i cant eat when im stressed or under stress i get sick and throw up everywhere how about migraines? medical cannabis helps with migraines do you understand what im getting at here? if i continued to take the chemical medications having stopped for my life in 2011id be deadwhy? because of chemical medications that professionals shoved down my throat im 38 years old and i feel so broken and incapableid rather not be breathingat allbut i have people who depend on melike my kidsand my partner who is also disabled but ive take a toke or two and im so much more pleasant an enlightened happy loving caring mood i enjoy my kids and their energy i enjoy my partners horrible humori can laugh instead of wanting to break down and bawl and wonder when the next big crash is coming it might not be right for everyone but to exclude people from talking about it or even referencing it because its a worldwide page and its not legal everywherewell thats no different than most of us have experienced in our livesbeing excluded for this or that or the other thing oh excuse me while i eat an entire brownie and get some well needed sleep and wake up feeling okay instead of taking a pill that makes my heart race when i already have gained heart issues from those professional prescribed chemicals several of which put me in the er had i not gone to the er each of those timesmy heart would have beaten itself to my death and exploded in my chest so please tell me if the chemical medications dont work for me but medical cannabis does? does that mean i have no valuable input? does that mean i have nothing to contribute because it will be deleted? go ahead delete it delete me too i find the lack of ability to allow for inclusion is mighty sad you knowbeing gay can get someone killed in other countries its outlawed in some other countriesshould i stop being gay where i live when i can do so legally and freely simply because its outlawed in other countries and not legal? sorry i dont think so you know what else? here in the stateswe drink coca-cola as a soft drinkthey sell it as cleaner in other countriesyou can find it in the household cleaner sectionnot here you find it in the soda isle but far be it from me to say anythingwho am iim a medical cannabis patient and i know nothingapparently,0
wow yep same here with trying different meds and coping mechanisms im sorry to hear that you struggle also hugs,1
im on 10mg of citalopram (celexa) a day and have found that it has done so much to manage my anxiety and improve my overall mood!!! i still get depressive episodes from time to time but they usually just hang around for a day or two and they arent as severe,0
i will always be on meds for my bi polar 1 and my anxiety and ptsd too til i die,1
yvonne white i take it for depression and anxiety it has really helped my mood disorder i take 40 mg every morning just once a day!,1
on the bright side the anxiety and depression are probably symptoms of the bipolar so you actually only have one problem not three :) if you have bp1 then that might account for the psychosis too  in which case you are 1 for 4  a good result treat the bp and most of the other stuff is manageable,1
same i always feel staff dont like me paranoid but i cant help it i am going for my second attempt at cbt ❤️️,0
hello thank you for sharing here im glad you decided to post and open up you have a lot going on right now and feeling overwhelmed is completely normal you still have a month left and in that time you can onlydo what you can do take care of yourself first that is the most important after semester you will have the summer to regenerate sometimes when i have anxiety i find a quiet space that gives me comfort if you had to redo this semester it wouldnt be ideal but if you were feeling better it would be worth it please know that you are not alone there are a lot of other students that feel the same way please reach out to someone close and talk about how you feel there areresources on campus also you can text 741-741 for text support you can private message me i would be happy to talk more you are not alone keep fighting,0
i do a lot of over thinking-induced stressing too and nights are definitely the worst nothing to do but lie there mentally re-living every traumatic experience youve ever had over and over again in your head til youre ready to either cry or physically hurt someone ive never had a major breakdown i dont guess just little ones here and there when i get really angry or too overwhelmed rage has always been my biggest problem but ive simmered down a lot in the last several years learned how to control it ive always found physical actitivities to be the most helpful mowing the yard cleaning just staying busy as long as no other people are around of course lol im not a good "peopler",0
hunny u have to just do it hes either gonna take it well or hes not u ate who you are and you should not be ashamed of that i have bpd anxiety panic attacks and mood swings its life just be honest,1
i am so glad that you found a doctor that was willing to look more into things rather than just state that its a product of your mental health disorder i am really struggling with the medications that i am taking because it seems like a never ending cycle i know i need the meds to remain stable but i dont feel like i reached stability yet as my meds continue to be adjusted,1
ok so part of being healthy is taking your meds like it or not we are incurable i makes me so sad when i see someone feel better and decide they are all fixed and quit taking their meds imagine if we struggle to live with ourselves how do we expect someone else to? take your meds,1
find something or better yet someone who can make you laugh uncontrollably especially at the most inappropriate things i know this seems odd or insane to some but it seems to work for bipolar 1& 2 schizophrenia &bpd the worst that can happen is a mood change even if only for a little while right ;),1
every antidepressant ive tried ive always gained weight on unfortunately its a site effect on most of the tablets they give you im no longer on medication as nothing works and now struggling to loose the 2 stone ive gained since being on bloody meds,0
i totally know what you mean the guilt you have after snapping at someone is awful just know its not your fault i have recently been diagnosed with bipolar and i am on 200g of lamotragine citrolapram and valium used only as a back up med just in case i go up or down to control my mania and depression so far so good we are all not alone here in our battle x,1
i cant even find where to write im so from manic depression feel like just walking yet parilsed don know where to go anywayanxiety is up ever since i came home from my trip i find partner acting like a holebut im guessing inthis state of mind itsprobably just misarble me just making him misarableany suggestion im really a big mess,0
i am self-diagnosed bpd and medically diagnosed with bipolar ii social anxiety and major depression i know i have bpd unfortunately every time i try to being it up to my therapist and my psychiatrist they push it off as just my bipolar,1
hi and congratulations! my daughter is now 15 so i dont remember what i was on but whatever they were all the docs all agreed they were safe during pregnancy but not safe enough for breastfeeding that was sad for me but there is so much more to that little life youll soon forget that part my daughter was born extremely healthy but because of genetics just bc keep an eye/ear out for any signs of dpression anxiety bipolar (im sorry; i forget what you said you have) and if/when you notice anything get he/she help as soon as possible i had my daughter in to a therapist at age 5 like i said 15 now and still seeing someone and just this past week started celexa for anxiety and depression i am so so so sorry for the long message good luck!,1
whos business is it? whos going to know? you need to do what makes you better or takes the edge off dont be scared it will all be finejust give it a try thats the best you can do to help you good luck x,1
the cook the theif his wife and her lover! everyone left the theater shaking their heads and saying what a piece of crap it was ugh!,0
if an incurable disease has invaded your life refuse to let it touch your spirit your body can be severely afflicted and you may have a great struggle but if you keep trusting gods love your spirit will remain strong,0
i hate to wake but but my dreams are so frightening i hate to go to sleep lose lose,1
i actually wear a amber anklet which i find helps with my anxiety especially whilst driving try it,1
i take a antihistamine called promethazine or phenergan as its known i take it to sleep and was told they not addictive or can be taken to od  hope you manage to find help like shannon said we here if you need to talk ive been through so much and still struggle  x,1
emma-jane naude i think i will try again with the doctors help as you are i feel so stupid asking them i feel anxious about the doctor laughing in my face and telling me i wouldnt deserve it or something ive worked all my life and want to continue working but have been signed off sick for 6 months now and my job is hanging in the balance the safety net of pip would take such a big weight off my shoulders,0
i am on 200 sertoline 150 pregabolin and 50 quitiapene and i am still in a bad place where i struggle to do simple tasks and never go out i hope your meds get sorted for you mate but it is hard when they keep messing with em,0
this explains so much! everything is about bipolar/depression/anxiety i understand bpd goes hand and foot with ptsd,1
i told a guy and he basically ran for the hills i let it lie until he liked a pic on my page im sorry dude but if you are too scared to be near me physically fuck off my page cause im not interested in what you think,0
i have bpd bipolar 2 ptsd adhd depression anxiety and ocdive been on effexor 1875mg lamictal 400mg intuniv 4mg for 3 years now (since i was 17) its been the most helpful combination of meds theyve ever tried and ive tried well over 100 meds since i was diagnosed at 10 years old,1
you could even write it in a letter (old school i know but it shows how much you care) when you hand it to her tell her that there are some things you wanted her to know but are hard for you to talk about the ball will be in her court then if she doesnt want to continue with the relationship dont let that get you down some people cant handle those of us with special needs because its not easy neither one of you would be a "bad person" if this happens on the other hand she may be open to going further with youthe unknowns and what-ifs of any situation causes us more stress than almost anything else god bless my friend!,0
whenever ive had panic attacks previously i used a reverse-psychology method where i tell myself im going to make it the worst one ever it inadvertently gives you control over it to some extent and it subsides quicker,0
woah! you do not need to be on 3 antipsychotics (latuda zyprexa seroquel) and an ssri (lexapro) and an snri (pristiq) also pristiq is definitely not dosed 3 times a day im sorry but as a pharmacist i need to let you know that this drug regime is a recipe for disaster there are no additional benefits with doses greater than 50 mg of pristiq same with greater than 20 mg of lexapro anything greater than that puts you at risk of dangerous heart arrhythmias how long have you been taking this regime? did your doctor educate you on the signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome? no wonder you are strugglingim so sorry i suggest you see another psychiatrist ‍♀️ i know that this is all unsolicited but as a healthcare professional i could not help it,0
do you know what it is about it exactly that causes your anxiety? or is it just the fact that its happening?,1
i recently had a bad episode and had a date i thought i was ok with him but the day i was upset and crying and he said i lead him on so yes i do know how much it hurtshe told me he was councillor so felt safe with him so now im thinking i am a very judge of characterits mad how you feel afterwardsyou feel awful,0
and it kind of makes you feel like a crappy person when you think if others in the world who dont have a family or home or ecti think its best to know we all have our own struggles either emotional physical mental spiritual we all have something going on and its best to accept it especially with anxiety just sat you know this is a messed up feeling but just because its today doesnt mean itll be tomorrow,0
i have suggested to somebody i know who has ocd anxiety and depression to try volunteering in a shop for either mind bhf pdsa the red cross etc just for the social element and for the experience of work in the hope that one day maybe they could use whichever skills they have gained in volunteering and apply for a paid job be it part-time or otherwise this would give them something to look forward to and hopefully help them build up their self-esteem in the long run having a volunteer job to begin with is a good start and it would not affect the benefit claims i tried to explain all this to the persons mother but she did not approve i really dont know why when it would serve as a constructive purpose and none of the benefits would be harmed in fact the dwp / employment centre / local council would applaud the effort in trying to do something positive,1
it makes you feel out of control when not in it your mad sad you want to cry at everything you cant sleep you fell off it awful i have been in it 15 years now my insurance says they no longer pay for it i dont know what im going to do im so scared i will get so sick plus im a ex drug addict im scared ill use to ease my pain so what ever you do try and keep your head up,0
medication is trial and error and takes a bit to work out but once you get it and its good life is so much better hang in there and keep fighting i lost my husband and almost lost my son due to my bipolar depression and anxiety it has taken years months days and lots of fighting but i did it so can you youve got this!,1
dont worry shaun its normal my partner suffers the same way and sadly my medication turns off my libido but if you have an understand in partner you can work everything out in the end its totally normal and you shouldnt be ashamed also wanting abuse in the bedroom is purely a bdsm fetish and again many many many people are into that sort of thing as long as it is done in a safe sane and consensual way and your mental health is looked after during the process then its perfectly fine to want that ,0
i found i cut so that it gave me something to focus on it forced me to take care of myself i got lucky im finally on some better meds my moods are fairly stable for the most part better than they have as long as i can remember i also have an amazing therapy cat that will keep head butting me and trying to get my attention until i stop hyperventilating or crying and ficus on him at first i didnt know why he was doing it and i used to get mad but i realized he only does it when im at my worst if possible maybe having an emotional support animal might be something to consider someone that needs love and a home that would be grateful for being saved he or she would help give you something else to focus on plus find a good doctor see if you need meds if it doesnt work right away try some new ones and dont be afraid to ask for help! hugs ❤️,1
my heart goes out to you nothing is more bad than your daughter telling you that you scare her this was after fighting with my ex because he said he would pay for my meds then changed his mindwell i sorted that out you have bad days dont crucify your self forgive your selftell your self that you love your self im also sick of fighting just to make it through the day but the positivity in me wont allow me to give upso darling you cant give up too xxx,0
relief i have anxiety n depression  i worry about everything n i get so down,1

irritable bowel syndrome,0
great question! with todays social lifestyles its not unusual to have a drink or two with dinner or catching up with friends i have been on prozac for 3 years and enjoy different wines especially with meals drinking every night is not advised as i found even one wine with dinner would make me feel drunk then the next day i would feel irritated and depressed my doctor knows i like a drink every now and then and said its fine in moderation so possibly special occasions or once a week 1 or 2 drinks this medication is there to do a job that your body cant do on its own so if you drink constantly your reversing its benefits then its really not going to work for you if you enjoy a social drink i would advise to continue that but drinking everyday is certainly not going to help you with the treatment of whatever reason that yoy are on prozac,0
see your doc tell them its an emergency or call an out of hours one  you must be feeling dreadful big hug,0
or you have my psychologist - "youre fine its just doubting yourself",0
cindy muhlenburg border it was a struggle to get off the seroquel but once the doctor got things changed for me i really sleep much better plus i stopped drinking soda and eating junk food talk to your doctor thats the best thing to do - good luck!,1
i have sort of experienced this not sure if its what you are but it feels like a mini seizure but not intense or anything i think it just may be from my nervousness and being tense for a long period of time it also does it when i lie down after being upset or feeling anxiety its frustrating,1
i took wellburtin for a little bit it made me so irritable ( spelling ) i never took the other one,1
is it anxiety attacks? bc thats what i was told when i was having them,1
in my opinion after all the hype surrounding this movie as the scariest movie ever the blair witch project was a truck load of shit,0
if you do start meds pay close attention to the changes it makes i was given an anti depressant and my manic spiked so bad it almost ruined my life a different anti depressant they put me on put me through worse depression and im still recovering from the sour effects that second one made me more suicidal the third med they put me on was venlafaxine (i think thats how you spell it) that one helped me more than the others but eventually my husband and i learned how to cope with my anxiety depression and bipolar the most important thing is having a good support system i honestly dont think if be here today without my sister mom and husband,1
yes people dont understand my family has a problem of everytime i get mad or upset its cause im mentally ill i hate it but i have to step back and keep telling myself they just dont like to be accountable for thier actions and i know its not me cause i can tell the difference when im manic and just pissed,0
latuda the next morning i saw/felt the walls moving when i laid in my moms bed and started at the ceiling super scary to see walls of a house shape shifting etc never took it again,0
mike struggled and struggled like you i know thats why he gave up the ghost,0
a therapeutic dosage for some people is 200mg for other people it can be as high as 400mg a day try not to be freaked out by all the side effects mentioned yet if you notice anything unusual tell your dr immediately im wondering if some of you are mistaking this drug for an anti-depressant lamictal is used as a mood stabilizer in psychology if a bipolar person takes an anti-depressant without taking a mood stabilizer itll cause a manic/hypomanic episode the lamictal helps the mood swings think of your mood like a pendulum the lamictal keeps you from swinging too far either way keeps the scary lows from being so severe this type of drug is necessaryeven when you feel better do not stop taking your medication unless directed by your dr i have tried almost every mood stabilizer they make as well as anti-seizure medication for mood stabilization in total i have been on it about 15 years they have tried others but always go back to lamictal hope this helps good luck to all of you:-),1
it has horrible withdrawal symptoms they had a class action law suit against them it wasnt working for me and they changed it to effexor the muscle spasms were so bad i could barely move had to put me on methadone for a couple of months sorry it was a really bad experience,1
i worked in non-clinical jobs for our local hospital for 23 years i worked 2 years longer than my psychiatrist wanted me too i am now seeking disability i have bipolar disorder ptsd general anxiety and on the physical side fibromyalgia i was out of work for about 8 months before i could really look back and see how stressed out i was i believe i was close to a breakdown i have my disability hearing in july after being out of work 2 and a half years,1
doctors do not know how any drug will affect a patient as they affect everyone differently they throw drugs at you in hopes something might work we all need to do our own research which is incredibly hard when one is struggling i have found the anti depressants to be very severely debilitating and do not take them anymore if you are bipolar the first med to try is lithium at a low dose about 300 mg and work up every other week please dont just take things because a doctor tells you to honestly i have learned many of them do not have a clue and can cause huge issues in someone trust your gut i think your doctor sounds frustrated that he has not been able to help you and is reaching at straws to try another answer i would try another doctor or two,1
i used to work full time but i had to change to part time because i was so mentally exhausted and was having panic attacks as soon as i clocked out i took 2 weeks off of work to rest you know whats best for you like you said everyone is different maybe you could try volunteer work when you start to feel better,1
i take zoloft i was told by my doctor not to stop even though i have horrible migraines i feel tired sleepy i dont see the energy she said id have i dont like this medication and i do want to stop taking it,0
this isnt meant to demean anyone for me anxiety has been caused from trying to control things out of my control that is happening around me or that i think will happen and the depression is caused by my sadness that things have happened and i cant do anything to change it we all suffer differently ~ s~,1
effexor is terrible with withdraw and actually made me want to kill myself if its working for you just give it time im always tired and im on zoloft its better than having panic attacks,0
i wish i could help but i was wondering how i can be able to cope lost everything because of my bipolar disordernow im just struggling to get through everything each day im tired of fighting not sure if i can fight another day not sure if i want to,0
ive been wobbling a lot lately but didnt want to admit it felt guilty for feeling low when i have so many good things in my life but it spun into a vicious circle ive got help though so ive broken the circle now,0
read leaflet inside med box and if worried call dr to ask about combination and side effects,0
i set an alarm on my phone to remind me,0
my psychiatrist wants me to start seroquel and i am petrified!!!had horrendous reaction to geodon w lomictal last fall during my 1st psych hospitalization last fall at 58 yrs old for my 1st mania lasting about 9 months including cutting which i havent done since 14 yrs old!they took me off geodon and lomictal xanaxcitalopramnow on clonazepam and mirtazapine but severely deppressed and dont know what to doso scared to start more medsalso had psychotic reaction to prozac about 30 yrs agoi also have cirrhosis of the liver and most meds have liver warnings but all of my psychiatrists dont seem to worry about thisstuck in a dark room and dont know how to get outdeppressed all my lifesurvivor of severe long term childhood traumaptsd! still not sure if i am bipolar!?anyone trying cbd oils with any success?any feedback appreciatedi cant seem to crawl out of this holefrozen in fear,1
my doctor used wellbutrin to bring me out of depression never for mania in fact she watches my dosage carefully so mania isnt triggered im bipolar one i use to be on lamictal for awhile it worked well i guess every doc has their way of doing the meds i just know if i get too much wellbutrin i become jiddery and anxious good luck,1
thats actually true i hv been struggling with bipolar disorders since years of medication has not helped me n my own confident dont understand,1
i use a nice sativa strain that doesnt make me paranoid or sleepy i has a nice pick me up to it and motivates me to get out and move also it is a great pain reliever,1
no it does not mean yr dangerous how horrible to say that your more than likely be a danger to yourself than others end of,0
but re-reading this post its not really one of the bad ones when you are struck with bipolar/depression/anxiety it does make you feel pretty helpless,1
im sorry to burst any bubbles but the simple assumption that a bipolar diagnosis suddenly opens the recipient to sunshine and rainbows to offset the total misery of depression is a frankly obscene disservice,1
i stopped my meds when we started trying to get pregnant and stayed off of them until about 9 months pp due to breastfeeding; it was rough to say the least but we all got through it i had/have post partum depression which has made being off meds for bipolar/ptsd/anxiety/depression much worse but we are working to get back on the right meds and im doing a lot better hang in there! once you have your little bundle of joy and start feeling more like yourself it will all be worth it--just take it one day at a time good luck!,1
if you need to go for a 72 hour eval they can get you a new doctor horrible that you were left like that happened to me if you need to go to your primary care doctor that is who helped when my doc bailed then found new doc,1
klonopin for panic attacks i refuse to take antidepressants,1
hi alisha sorry you have been feeling depressed how long has this been going on for you and have you been prescribed any medication? the symptoms of depression can be managed but you may benefit from some counselling to talk through the cause and to help you explore some coping mechanisms for your social anxiety these things take time so dont put any pressure on yourself to feel better over night as there isnt a quick fix i hope this helps ~vw~,1
it is why i belong to no organized religion when the church told my father i was a whore for allowing my uncle to get his kicks out of bouncing me on his lap (i was maybe 3??) and surely more so when i asked why was there blood in my underwear after a visit with my cousins! age 6 or 7?? so no people who believe this kind of vudoo thinking are only clinging to irrational and harmful beliefs in my opinion it holds back our humanity,0
robyn shook,0
blood pressure off the charts tho,0
ive been indoors over a year due to people and terrible anxiety id rather someone throw a net over me and drag me out of here ,0
hey my partner is like you he has bipolar as well as depression and anxiety he often in his lows gets drunk for long periods of time and says he doesnt want to be together and the next day says he loves me then says doesnt want to be together etc what should i believe that he loves me or that he doesnt want the relationship,0
i have depression/anxiety/ptsd and have been on it for a couple years and its worked pretty good =),1
i would live in the moment especially as you are well enough to date at the moment if you experience any symptoms during your courtship live in the moment then and talk about it if you feel you are having an episode and if you are unwell remove yourself from each other until your feeling better thats me you cannot predict the future and you need to get to know each other first dont scare them off we all have periods of normality and who knows if your happy it may not be an issue sometimes self disclosure is better kept to a minimum all the best ,0
you shouldnt have to feel nervous- its our bodies i was on lamictal and wellbutrin (and a few others!) and just one week dropped my dose then the next week dropped it again then i was off and i did great! ive traded all my meds for clean eating exercise and essential oils its something i have to plan and work on daily but its natural abd my body feels great no more side effects from all those meds! ❤️ good luck and listen to your own body!,1
i have a friend with schizo-affective disorder + paranoia who has these issues but is open to and grateful for help however their sibling is much more severe and sees everything and everyone as part of a plot obviously help is needed but resorting to trickery or sectioning could prove the beliefs correct please seek advice and support from mental health agencies best wishes x,1
this is a hard question i have extra weight from the drugs - my shape changed - i got that buddha belly - and always had a fairly lean mid section it was the drugs now if i wanted to lose weight i would eat high protein and veges do weights of high reps and low weight and 30 min of cardio 4x a week i would eat protein or a protein shake for breakfast total day cals would not go over 1000 thats my best advice to you plus a multivitamin and fishoil,0
im not a doctor but im treated directly for maintenance high-level ⚡anxiety i take lithium and zonisamide and lorazepam which is a benzo please get him to a proper psychiatrist! anxiety is horrible,1
every day is a struggle for me and its hard but i would let it win this time this biche is not going down with out a fight it can grow legs and pissed off,0
i know u feel that way ive had constant panic attacks for over a year switched my meds 18 times but now the panic attacks lessened if theres hope for me theres hope for anybody,0
go! you sound like you have planned and are sensible many people in abusive situations never leave or repeat the situations again and again you are becoming an adult and it seems as though you want to break the cycle be proud of yourself! dont give in to doubt! dont give in to fear! your next step is the hardest but you can do it we all have faith in you and wish you the very best!!! live your life - your parents have chosen theirs and their choices are not in your best interest live your life and make it worthwhile heck i dont even know you and i am proud of you for standing up for yourself and achieving what you have done and setting yourself up for the next step - now lift that foot up and go!,0
medication is part of the answer especially with anxiety / depression therapy/counselling/cbt/dbt are also important to explore underlying issues/thought processes,1
carrie the motivation issue is something i still struggle with from time to time at 17 i just wanted to be left alone to do my own thing which wasnt healthy for me at all thank goodness my parents were proactive about pushing me to do things and that my doctor was amazing in helping me work through things it may not be what you want to do but some tough love may be in order here if your son can get a jump start to his motivation it may spur him onward with things he does have to have the want to get better and do what it takes though i would suggest that you talk to his doctor and maybe even a counselor to get some ideas on how to help your son they should be able to give you support along the way as well since youve probably got a difficult road ahead of you mental illness isnt very kind to begin with and adding teenage hormones to the mix makes it that much more difficult,0
is it scary to be alone yes make a extreme effort if you mzke neigh ors where u r they can check on u and u them we all meed help,0
hawthorne works for me hawthorne controls and corrects low blood pressure it also lowers high blood pressure,1
laurens grandma here i didnt know how the anxiety made you feel i am sorry you missed thr party but know your friendship with lauren is very important to her,0
how about demanding more from your panic attack? this teaches your mind that you are not in danger and you are calling its bluff,0
having bipolar disorder and being a parent myself he has legitimate concerns i am a good mother i do anything i can to make sure my kids are taken care ofbut there have been times that i hate to admit when i have been manic i am not the best parent i can be it puts a lot of strain on my kids and my significant other he has to make up for where i am lacking and that is just added stress for him with a good support system though and a partner who understands the illness it can be a sucessful family it takes work!! from everybody i hope they can find a way to work out their issues and be happy!,1
id like to but i never really knew where to begin i started having stress tics and went to a neurologist and they prescribed me topamax to help with my anxiety and i told them it didnt do anything and they never really listened to me and i just quit going and taking the meds after awhile because it seemed they didnt want to help no matter what i told them i think im going to go to my regular doctor and find out what she can do to help me,0
im the same way it feels i push ppl away i tell way to much then its used against me later i have had 2 breakdowns since 2015 i never can get enough sleep i just lay here worrying that im headed right back into an episode i feel so tired all the time i try everything i have in my tool box  i live on very little sleep sometime go for days go for days im prerscibed 5 meds including ambian but never feel rested my mind races i meditate read count in my head drink sleepy time tea i miss appointment bc im exhausted just saw my med dr yesterday he increased my mood stabilizer been in mania hypoagitation since memorial day weekend been having a high and finally getting things done i put off for almost two yrs just waiting for the crash and the lows to come and not be able to do one thing just remember your not alone and that theres no easy cute but i believe it will be manageable in time thanks for sharing hope this helps a little do some self care a mindfullnesstake care,0
people dont even begin to understand unless they live with the struggle,0
if youre struggling and your people are just sitting there watching you struggle theyre not your people so be it,0
i have struggled daily for years with suicidal thoughts every morning i wake up and ask myself if today is the day i keep the local crisis lines phone number close at all times i try to change up my routine even the slightest i sleep for days straight i will sit in a public place alone but still surrounded by bystanders and i even just randomly visit friends so i am not alone the worst thing when feeling suicidal is isolation being alone with your thoughts that only lead you in one direction is dangerous dont ever feel afraid to reach out you dont have to be explaining why just do not try and work through it alone be well,0
i wasnt done my family didnt want to hear it my life changed for the better once i got the right meds try to leave information around for family members can look at remember they love you more than you fear talkin to them i hope i helpedhugs,0
i find them great helped with my bipolar 2 and no more panic attacks  no side affects for me ,1
effexor works better for me than celexa lexapro wellbutrin and prestique i had absolutely no weight gain and no other side effects  works well for me only issue ive had has been the fact that if i miss a dose i feel crappy and uneasy until i take always keep a day or two of meds with me no matter where i am going just in case i get somewhere and realize i forgot a dose,1
when i was on it i would drink cautiously if i was out to dinner the biggest caution i got was about drinking and taking xanax for my panic attacks it is not recommended to drink while on ssris but you should be asking your pharmacist or your primary care if you are worried about side effects,1
i have just finished a months worth and just got prescribed 1 more month and i totally understand how you are feeling it has made my bipolar almost non existent (well it seems like it) no anxiety depression or manic im thinking clearer and everyone in my family and close circle of friends have said i am the best ive been in 13 years and only my mother and sister know im taking duromine its insane i wish there was something we could do to keep it up if you find out a solution let me know please good luck with weight loss and bipolar battles,0
thank you for saying that i feel so helpless for my friend she is a beautiful person and so broken right now calling someone nasty names and being heartless when there confused scared and feeling lost is not ok,0
prudence lowe benjamin yeah while i was here a woman had a seizure due to them not getting her lamictal ordered in a timely matter due to that i got my lamictal sooner than any other because i made a big deal about the chick almost dying because of missing it and i was like two days behind her on my missed doses and started panicking,0
one of the only meds so far that has worked for me it definitely helps and im impatiently waiting to get to my target dose so i can feel the full effects of being level and "happy",1
i have bipolar 1 with full blown psychotic episodes with auditory and visual hallucinations and extreme paranoiahaving both is sometimes called schizoaffective disorderand the older i getim almost 44the more psychotic episodes im having,0
been on lexipro didnt think it did anything for me supposed to help me i think with obsessing,0
has he tried therapy by chance? therapy drained me and i ended up dropping out i was in group therapy but i also have ptsd and severe anxiety along with bp i couldnt take on hearing others traumatic situations anymore it did teach me coping skills and renewed coping skills id forgot i had tho ive never used my illness as an excuse to act out wrongly unfortunately i do still get flustered from time to time and have outbursts (usually over the smallest things) before i can help myself but i try and stop it as soon as i realize it and i own up to it i admit i was wrong and apologize for me its about being very vigilant of myself at all times especially since i dont do pharmaceuticals perhaps therapy and learning such skills could benefit him? im sure he doesnt mean to be that wayits just as exhausting for him as well believe it or not wishing you strength and courage in working thru this ,1
rest  proper diet and attempting to stay free of stress are key in recovery and maintaining a healthy balance,0
look for another job that is less stressful,1
thats what im afraid of,0
take them period i have diabetes depression & anxiety i take them religiously like my insulin these meds are our ticket for the journey to wellbeing,1
i believe in god i pray for help and to be healed god made me this way  its a daily struggle believing in a higher power wont cure this disease,0
what are the causes of anxiety!,1
im sorry an its not that scary there theyll take good care of you,0
i had a supervisor who i had trusted and i confided in apparently she notated my file the next supervisor i had became very agitated and afraid of me after she read my file when i asked what was the matter she refused to answer me so i went to her boss and found out the reason she then refused to meet with me alone in the same room i was not allowed to read my file either i went to human resources after that and requested a new supervisor which was turned down i was working in a call center where there was constant noise change interruption you name it all things that are really bad for someone with bp i ended up in the hospital several times and eventually went on short term then long term disability after that experience i am very careful who i confide in but you betcha i stick up for us when people have blown out ideas about bp,0
i filed for disability last july denied in nov and filed my judge appeal in dec still waiting :( luckily my bf has barely been keeping us going its extremely difficult ive even tried to go back to work because i was frustrated and ended up having a severe panic attack and flipping out before my first day just cant do it anymore id do anything to have the old me back :(,0
i have severe separation anxiety depression bi polar ii and constant panic attacks not working trying to get ss have been on every med there is since the mid 80s nothing has really worked pretty much crippled by my mental issues cant get anything done or make any needed changes in my life i sometimes wonder when it will get to be too much to continue on i have no insurance any advice?,1
i have been forced to take time off work sick for up to a yr at a time due to my bipolar type 2 im bk at work now but some days i get going no problems other days i battle with myself to get out of bed i struggle to keep going and working can be so hard and drain me but if i didnt force myself to go to work id be stuck at home feeling worse its hard but keep fighting ❤,0
i highly suggest coming clean about it since you have kept it a secret for so long just calmly bring it up and tell him that you are very sorry and were scared to tell himif he truly loves youhe will talk it out with you,0
hear hear well done kit i do think that our recovery begins with us if id left it to the doctors id still be in a bad place but by changing my gp (to one who understands ( bipolar & bpd) and discussing my care plan getting myself back on track with her help and advice i really dread to think where id be now its not easy and i do have good/bad days/weeks but i know if im in trouble i only have to pick up the phone to my gp the local mental health helpline or any of my very good friends and someone will help me im blessed xx,0
yeah you clearly dont know how anxiety works,1
mental illnesses are not character flaws theyre not proof that we are screw-ups lazy or stupid they dont make us bad mothers sisters or daughters they dont give you an excuse to be angry at us to disrespect us or to dismiss our opinions we are worthy of respect and acceptance which too often we only receive from each other if youre a hater shame on you it takes more effort to be shitty to me than it would to have an honest reciprocal relationship with me my daughters and my mother (from whom they learned their callous selfish behavior) are missing out thank goodness for my dear departed grandparents who helped me hang on to my belief in myself and my few cherished friends ,0
thats normal with many psych meds usually itll subside within a month worse case scenario it may take 2 months if they do not subside within 2 months please tell your doctor what is happening ive had medications where i started having involuntary facial movements if this occurs on any medication you want to tell your dr right away this could become permanent if the drug is not discontinued its not as scary as it sounds but thats one side effect you need to be sure to tell your dr about good luck to you:-),1
i would recommend it for anxiety i cant manage without it,1
my phone is on 24/7 if anyone needs someone to talk to dont hesitate to throw me a msssage ,0
and also sometimes it could have something to do with throid condtion on the sucide thoughts and depression maybe get it checked i was having some of the same issues and found out my throid was low but i also have ptsd bipolar anxiety and socail anxieety,1
i can relate to this plus the added worry that what if i do the wrong thing~sandi~,0
my anxiety is bad right now i keep praying and talking to god,1
mental healthcare has become horrid in the us one size fits all hospitalizations caged as animals wearing paper clothing and paper sheets as bedding  the (mis)treatment is worse and more anxiety causing & painful than the illness for me,1
future problem worry about the now sweet lady!! ,0
in the bedroom horrible,0
positive energy coming your way and a great big hug ive been there i was hospitalized in june and it was scary but the people were incredibly nice and so helpful i wish you all those things hang in there just take one moment at a time and breathe <3,0
yea my son think about it all the time he would be better off died i just pray everything will be ok hes going through depression and anxiety really bad since my grandmother pass in 2015,1
thanks for sharing our story!! everyone please feel free to share our story this was avoidable for our daughter our daughter is 12 and has been stable we begged and pleaded with our property management to do the right thing and to take our daughters mental health into consideration its so important to have a stable and structured environment for her 22 days being in a hotel or with family with hotels were booked is far from the life we have provided for our kids especially our daughter who needs this lifestyle to make her safe,0
im on lexipro took about 8 weeks before i felt any difference my doctor said the minimum people should be on it is 6 months i plan to come off soon coz i have a horrible side effect of night sweats :( saturated having to change nearly every night ,0
also look into seraquil thats a mood disorder medicine and helps treat bipolar and anxiety its taken at night the upside to the is they work together and cymbalta once you get to 60mg it can also act as a pain medicine as well,1
it is when it is unpredictable how ur day is going to turn out xx i find it a struggle to get through life without feeling emotional ,0
hang in there i struggle too am todaybut i know if i wait it will lift and i will feel better again you arent alone! and youre cared about more than you know i know i speak for many of us when i say if you need to talk we will be here you can always email me at if you dont want to message me on fb you can be as anonymous as you wish please dont go it alone,0
i did this too writing everything i was experiencing when i went to a psychiatrist the first time i hate meds but i have a lot of things wrong there are some that are out there and it would ease the anxiety i think after that your behavioral therapy would be easier that is my opinion like everyone seems to be saying you need to open up to your psychiatrist or youre not going to get the right help youve suffered enough! tell him everything and how it makes you feel thoughts and prayers,0
yep i mean and yes dont worry i am/have rapid cycling bipolar 2 and do exactly the same so both ends of the spectrum covered ,1
works well for me only side effect ive had is that it makes me drowsy otherwise its kicked my anxiety and depression in the balls,1
my pet hate with bpd is the fear of rejection and the sense of abandonment that can be so intense whether founded on fact or fiction,0
because it is still so little understood under researched and u set funded and its frightening - duh! we need to stop calling it mental illness and call it brain illness we dont call people with dementia or alzheimers mentally ill so why label other brain located illnesses under this useless label,0
try to eliminate some of the meds that are not doing anything for you and keep taking the meds that do it can take quite a while to find which ones are right for you and what the minimum dose is that is effective being pressured will not leave you in a position to reduce any of your meds being misunderstood will make you feel worse i have had to accept that i have to take my tablets i have tried to stop taking them before and landed up being much worse than what i began work with your doctor or mental health clinic to establish which one or two tablets may be balancing the chemicals in your brain sometimes the onset is triggered by certain persons in your life but even if you stay away from them you may need less meds but the imbalance will still be there albeit to a lesser degree people who do not understand sometimes are denying their own shortcomings concerning their mental health good luck,1
find a therapist i am bipolar 1 depression anxiety i am on buspar lithium latruda seraquil just started seraquil world of difference in the last month hope you find something that makes you feel better,1
yes that is to much i was on a load of meds years ago and i never knew what was doing what i think you need to ask your dr to try you on one thing for bipolar 2 and something for anxiety see if that makes a difference hope this helps x,1
reallydont yellthats a stresser ,0
im not sure which is more terrifying id like to know which is closer to the real me though,0
i really wish you the best trust me suicide is never the answer especially if you have wonderful kids that need you if your husband cant see what he has then that is his loss and you deserve so much better for you and your beautiful angels recently i have had a family member commit suicide and he had 2 children and trust me when i say that those little girls are going through too much for a kid to handle just wondering why their dad didnt want to be with them anymore life is beyond too short as it is look to god and look into those babies eyes and i promise life will start to fall back together you may be crushed right now but i have severe anxiety and depression and have been there my mom is manic depressive which is a term for bipolar and she gets pretty bad and i have to tell her how much we all love her and would die without her she is my rock! such a strong woman and you too can be that strong! may god bless you!,0
i think i just a need to fill something that cant be satisfied i am a man of god so i say this confidently and as a person that struggles with mental illness that once you come to terms that earthly possessions and desires will never satisfy a person with well controlled med regime and a prayerful and god seeking life you can overcome the feeling of emptiness,0
awe sweetie you have no clue how nice it was to see you the other day it made my day sorry i was abit weird and thankyou very much with the beautiful words i like alot of people on that page deal with alot of ups and downs and sometimes its a daily struggle to find something worth fighting for today was a rough day because of fathers day,0
i think homeschooling is great in certain situations but im sorry to sound like a smartass  youre assuming a lot from the original post if standard schooling had repeatedly failed then homeschooling may be a good idea but just to remove an already stressed child basically a from his community you are only going to exacerbate the problems,0
when you get your panic attacks is there anything you can do to help calm yourself down (ie listen to music deep breathing etc)?,1
i have anxiety ptsd bipolar1 mania which is,1
if you want to conquer the anxiety of life live in the moment live in the breath,0
another small gem given me by a beloved friend that my attitude is more important than the facts and its not about what happens to us its what we do with what happens to us which will determine whether we go up or down and something lve struggled with for awhile up to last friday our negative thoughts create our own reality and the best little cliche lol our attitude determines our altitude! find something to laugh about read some funny jokes online watch a funny movie take a walk on the beach see all the beauty surrounding us rejoice! and you shall rejoice again one day you shall again know happiness and peace each one of us holds the seeds to our own unhappiness within us but we also hold our happiness there we are left to make the choice and remember that our happiness doesnt lie in our partner or in things lets choose to be happy bless you <3,0
holy wow that is seriously scary ive experienced sleep paralysis once but nothing on the level you have and i still have major insomnia problems,0
and they are very dangerous when coming off benzodiazepines one should really do a medical detox for risk of seizures most put one on phenobarbitol for it,0
2 get overwhelmed  to much house to keep clean,0
i didnt see any symptoms at all of schizophrenia hearing voices in common with major depressive disorder and also severe anxiety,1
lifestyle changes can also work! i wish soneone would have given me that option before filling me up w meds that caused so many side effects what we eat is sooooo important bc food turns to chenicals and chenicals are what control the mind i was also told the only way to control my anxiety was medswrong! exercise does way more than meds did and without more side effects yes i sgree sometines people need meds to reboot but not for a perm solution,1
try take 1 step at a time your not worthless your worth every breath you take i suffer the same but every now and then i organise to go out with a girlfriend the anxiety is soo bad leading up to the nite but iv worked out once im out its ok & then i dont want to go bak home 1 step at a time,1
i understand how you feelmost of the time because we feel that way dont make it soi think it should be their choice to see you instead of you deciding for themyou dont need guilt trips added to what you already have going onjust let them know you are there & will do what you can to the best of your ability fear can really mess with our livesit has been awhile sometimes its best to let sleeping dogs liei dont know the situation on the other end but i can & will pray for yousometimes people dont or cant understand what others go through until they experience it themselvesyou can say all the buts and i woulds truth being yall dont knowgod bless you!,0
it doesnt ease your difficulty but bear in mind that many of us here and many people in general society will have had at least one crushing breakup in their time so believe me you can and will get over it but again remember that wont ease your pain and dont expect it to this is a natural reaction to the situation and many people go through different thought processes after such events i had one early on as a young lad and later in life i was divorced not long after believe me i thought i was toast both times years on i now have a loving partner and two kids (not mine but they act like they are!) who think im tops i still have my struggles but at the end of the day my life is better than i vould ever have imagined,0
get any help you can ive been there (many times) and you cannot do this alone my thoughts and prayers are with you and everyone else experiencing these terrifying feelings and behaviors it is not you it is the disease,0
i suffer with ptsd anxiety depression and bipolar for over 17 years now i have been battling since then i want to share my newest ink loving your tattoo thanks for sharing,1
what!? youre crazy! (not in literal terms) ive spoke with a lot of nice people who share my struggles and if they dont theyre generous to talk to you and if you feel like no ones listening to you im here ☺️,0
ive recently come home from 2 weeks in a psych hospital not a nice one but a super-max-type locked-down place with no civil rights you need it? you cant have it cause somebodys figured out how to turn it into a weapon or drugs i have ptsd night terrors and anxiey and depression they had to let me go before i was ready because a woman was trying to kill me and my pulse was so high they were afraid i would have a stroke why didnt they put her in a locked room? well because she had a right to be there so i am home withdrawing from effexor i only took it for 3 weeks before the edema hair loss vision changes heart rate changes etc till they believed me that it was killing me,1
i also have bipolar and adhd i take ritilan lithium and serequol by 3-4pm im the same upset & angry ive been thinking its the ritilan but without it i have zero focus memory & concentration tried taking an extra dose of ritilan at 3pm but then my mind wont shut off at bed time and disturbed sleep makes me manic its all a vicious cycle ,1
its draining  i find that exercise  eating properly and just not being afraid so speak your mind helps a lot  im a nurse and sometimes i feel like ill upset someone and the truth is ive learned that anxiety can be treated my simply just eliminating toxic people in your life and appreciating the positive people in your life  family  friends coworkers and people you trust,0
i had panic attacks on my first few sessions but now im starting to feel comfortable so its okay remember that theyre professionals in that field and probably have seen a lot of people having panic attack so they wont see you as someone weird or crazy saying this because i think panic attack gets worse when you control it because you dont want other people to see it so tell yourself its okay to have panic attack afterall thats the reason why you need professional help,0
i too have a 17 year old very friendly kindespecially to those in need before we got him the right help he was hospitalized multiple times during manic phases over three years he went from having hundreds of friends to having no friends because of his uncontrolled behavior once he was properly medicated he leveled out and has returned to his old self his friends never returned but he has a new hope it is nice to read the positive comments on this site i would just add that at 17your not alone there are others wishing they too had someone like you to talk too and relate keep up with your doc visits and medicine there are people out there waiting to become your friend,0
its true and i lost that when my mumma passed away been a year and a half of struggling alone with no support and it sux,0
everyone reacts differently to certain meds i did horribly on wellbutrin it made my anxiety worse yet others do great on it,1
if youre bipolar the zoloft wont help itll only hurt and i would suggest seeing a psychiatrist especially being pregnant medications are dangerous i understand treatment is crucial as im bipolar 2 with mixed features and severe anxiety i had to quit my treatment while pregnant and it was awful i wish you the best of luck mama no matter the direction you have to turn and congratulations!,1
when i am in mania mood i cant get enough i actually had multiple affairs that i am not proud of and it caused a divorce i could not control it after i did it i felt so guilty i would cry and just lay in bed depressed,0
i thought avoiding eye contact is a autism thing?,0
i stopped worrying till symptoms appeared ,1
nature/nurture? i can`t get a straight answer there is a gene associated with bipolar (bp1 i know so i assume bp2 too) if you have this gene it`s easily triggered some people without this gene can be thrown into mh issues if truama is severe enough i worry about my girls but (!) i know to watch for signs so i can catch it early & get them into treatment i`m always aware they are watching me & it helps me stick to my treatment plan i want them to see me be responsable about it so if they ever have to they will know how,0
reminders on your phone/check list/ alarms ,0
im scared to go back on my lithium i rather drink in my house,0
im struggling myself,0
im using mederma to get rid of the scares i only started yesterday and there is a very noticeable difference already you can try something like that i hate people seeing my scares they dont want to have nothing to do with you but its all the time every day they dont want nothing to do with me  keep up the fight some day someone will come into your life and support you love you hugs,0
when its actual mental illness its not easier to play on a phone or watch a moviewhy not? because yes it seems easier but our head doesnt let it be we are thinking about what needs to be done why didnt i just do it? maybe i can just do it but if you try you will fail youre so worthless you cant do this everyone knows youre worthless and stupid hell even your own mom hates you dont you see it everything she looks at you cant you hear it in her voice shit like that and it keeps going so yes i may have a netflix show on or try playing a game when i should be filling out paperwork for something that will really fuck me up later but my head is talking shit im on the verge of crying and trying not to so nobody knows im upset because i feel nobody cares it gets so bad im fighting myself as to whether or not i should continue wasting the space on this planet and the only reason im still here is so i dont fucking up my kids so dont tell me mental illness is being fucking lazy,0
im also scared im gonna now have some kind of withdrawl when stopping the seraqual,0
most anxiety medications are pretty tame nadine maybe chat to your gp before making any decision personally i cant live without my medications the quality of life just doesnt exist unless im level,0
ive been taking seroquel for yearsregular not xr i was on 300mg but got restless leg syndrome so bad i had to drop it to 200mg which helped otherwise i love it helps me sleep i notice when i forget to take it,1
withdrawals are a bitch 1 to 2 weeks of misery i just went off prozac and zyprexa but i did it at home cause i couldnt function psychiatrists always want to drug us i am on mild xanax and non habit forming hydroxizine ( visteral) andyes i have extremes highs and lows but id rather have that than the side effects of all that other shit it took about 3 weeks to detox plus i detoxed from cigarettes too tough but doable,0
yoga or tia chi to balance self breathing exercises play music and sing around the house i deal with anxiety and self harm and i understand how hard it is i wanna do now but have to fight! go for a run! workout prayers to u and if u need anything pm me call hotline! stay strong and fight! you are not alone,0

i took myself off of my adhd meds in 2001 i cant take antidepressants or antianxiety meds because i have severely bad side effects i live with depression and my anxiety attacks (chest pains and panic attacks) because i dont know any way of coping or what i can take for them ive tried seeing a psychologist but talking about my problems only brought back the memories that brought this burden upon me in some ways it seems that my depressed state drives people away from me to where they dont want to hang out or socialize with me which leads me to become more depressed and angry controlling my temper is very hard at times and i just cant help myself ive had thoughts of suicide but i dont have it in me to go through with it it would hurt a lot of people but as i continue living i am the one with mental pain people act or seem like they dont care or miss me im sure if i just up and died they would think a lot differently to the ones who dont talk to me they may see me and say they recognize me but they will not know me for i will have changed every day i feel like im drifting further away from people and with less contact i feel its not going to get any better,0

yes with both zoloft and mirtazapine (or any antidepressant really)  made me 10000x worse i was irritable aggressive and really suicidal if you have bipolar then antidepressants may not be the best thing for you i would be speaking to your doc again asap to review your meds no they shouldnt make you feel like that,1
i feel like talking about it helps you more i dont even have to talk about anymore my therapies at soca my daily basic problems because it was really good to talk about we people they know my abuser and the more painful worse when my family didnt care even they know there was my brother hes a doctor a dental dr and everybody knows him as a serious man in the community but because my family didnt support me he get away with but its fine for me because now im leaving a better life but people that i wanted to understand and believe what im saying it was the witnesses that couldnt say nothing before and they support me not my family will people for my town they told me they know whats going on but they were so scared about this guy because he was the president of my country really close friend and dominican republic if you do something wrong you could kill nobody cares about it thats what im coming from i never went back to my country for almost 19 years lets talk about it with your therapist or anyone that is in the same situation is really good and help you a lot my god bless everyone of you to being abused,0
i got bipolar disorder 2 and ptsd and i dont know lately whats going on with me i used to be very friendly looking for friends always give opportunity to people to be in my life but right now i really dont want to socialize at all i go to the street and speak with everyone and treat everybody good but when its about people asking me for my phone i start lying to them because i dont want to have friends out there i just realized that all the time make people and they know what i have or have to tell them what i have right away they start treating me differently and im getting tired about then i born by myself and im bored with it tween why should i have to care about what other things about me all the way i am i prefer to be alone even man im sick about it what i leave in the bronx new york they call womans crazy if they know you got bipolar they dont have respect and i dont have time to get upset i prefer to be alone for happy,0
i hear you i had 2 baby boys a workaholic husband and chronic depression with anxiety my toddler was an early riser and would wake baby brother up my baby was premature and on a 3 hour feeding schedule and could not suckle exhaustion is probably putting it lightly i found it so difficult to find time to rest and had insomnia that i was dragging butt all the time try all avenues to find a means to get good sleep maybe someone could watch your children or they could stay with a relative do this as a necessity top priority for you and your family you are essential for their well-being and for that you need to feel well and rested if moms not happy nobodys happy simple credo  hard to do i wish you sweet dreams!,1
tell him how you feel but honestly if you expect to be given something or have something special done for you every 5 months you will be truly disappointed! think about the good things does he treat you right every other day? does he show his love every other day? my husband and i have been together for 17 years its only in the past 2-3 yrs that hes actually mad an effort to celebrate our anniversaries! he tells me he loves me ever day and kisses me every day so im nit worried about what he doesnt do on the anniversaries! can take a while to realise the small things matter more but once you do realise its such a relief!,0
i dont know what med or meds youre on i hope a good mood stabilizer like lithium at a dose like 900mg talk to your doctor about anti psychotics at night to rest your brain and give you regular sleep and both these types of drugs help with anxiety,1
in reading this i realized again how lucky i was when i became so ill my employer? wanted me to get better i put a huge strain on my co workers and they worked tirelessly to accommodate me i finally gave up and quitsome people arent so lucky im sorry for that in your case also i had a therapist that knew exactly what to do again extremely lucky my dr the nurses all of them there are programs like respite or maybe if you can trade housekeeping for a room or caregiver until you find your way s security/disability im quite sure you werent asking anyone to solve your problems its hard sometimes when a person is overwhelmed to be so perfect in explaining what they need from others happens to me all the time i gave up the dating world a long time ago its to difficult for me personally im not even close to being ready for that for you may be different probly not the best when you meet in treatment so many intense emotions being shared can trick you into thinking its love (not impossible tho) i think they call it trauma bonding also exercising doesnt help everybody keep asking for help and youll find something that works for you,0
dianne guilloty is there any crisis help available where you are? please please reach out there must be professionals who can help your children need you so much im sure your loved ones need you do they realise how bad things are for you? i remember feeling that i couldnt go on that i needed an escape from the torment but its not the answer there is a better way its just finding the way i know how dire and hideous it can be craving an escape from the daily misery it can get better but you have to lean on those who love you and let people help are there any services available to you? x,0
yes it is very hard i have a partner now and it has been pretty tough for us to get to a point where he can get me to trust him and for him to understand all the quirks about bpd but there are times when stressors can affect us like his favorite cat being run down by a car we are both devastated but somehow our bond is holding us together,0
well could be either im not claiming to be a dr i was first diagnosed bipolar i last year now im being told more likely bipolar ii bcuz the mania isnt as severe and theyre more depressive spells i was however hospitalized once 2 yrs ago when i was just very upset but like ive never felt invincible or done anything more than depicted above but could be either for me - or this person to clarify either way i empathize,0
they have changed my lifeinitially i thought they made me feel flat but then realised they had stopped all th background anxiety and my brain was quietthey also stabilised my mood swings x,1
very well said i dont have any of these illness but someone very close to me has and ive being consided crazy to the people around me because i didnt believe that if he got medicated that we were just gonna wake up and things were gonna go back to normal i wish it could work like that i really do but very well said need more ppl not being afraid to admit it,0
no you need a psychiatrist and i highly doubt you have bipolar if your moods change several times in one day its borderline personality disorder if they take a week or two to change between extreme high and extreme low its bipolar but how you explained it it is most certainly not bipolar which meds dont fix borderline personality disorder,1
i wake every morning with anxiety wondering how im going to cope with my day thats what gets to me,0
yes i know just one of mine is over 900$ if my insurance didnt pay for it its horrible you know it only costs the drug companies pennies on the dollar to make the drugs,0
and down somewhere the darkest road something follows me i am not alone because misery loves my company - dean winchester (supernatural ),0
i ha e borderline personality disorder and i am a recovering drug addict but the one thing that i continually obsess about is sex constantly especially if its been awhile or it wasnt satisfyingi could spend hours in bed with a woman and some women cant keep up with me the obsession of addiction is always a part of a lot of mental disorder symptoms i amd definitely hyper sexual ive talked to my therapist about it and the only thing she says is that i should find someone who is just as hypersexual as me,0
i suffer from severe anxiety and depression :-( it sucks sooo bad,1

i had 9 ect treatments several years ago i was in a very deep depression for over 2 years that no other treatment or meds would help it helped me a lot if i ever had to i would go through it again you definitely need good support going through it as it is hard on your body and your memory but it is well worth the work the first treatment is a little scary as you dont know exactly what to expect,1
what does your comment mean? i am so confused! lol ~dani,0
prayers for everto be fighting mental illnessit is horrible,0
i have mood disorder  ptsdmanic depression  anxiety and panic disorder since i was really young i have a great therapist and psychiatrist but i am struggle still i think about harming myself a lot i been group therapy and inpatient will be doing soon i wake everyday and tell myself everything is ok,1
i agree with bettina find a new doctor my psychiatrist put me on risperidone for ptsd he tried me on ssri anti depressants like fluoxetine escitalipram snd sertraline they didnt work for me but they may work for you he also put me on imipramine which is another anti depressant that i take to this day i tried gabapentin for anxiety and diazepam meds work differently for everyone and you have to find someone whos willing to keep on trying different meds to see what works for you,1
o i wish i had the book now it sounds so good its a shame that i dont have anyone in my hometown i can talk to when im feeling low but its nice talking to you bambi stell you sound like a lovely person ,0
im taking 50mg of zoloft but i tried my hardest and waited until i was in the middle of my 2nd trimester where all his major organs were developed already it was really hard during the time i was off all medications but for me the benefits outweighed the risks sometimes it can do more damage if you are anxious and depressed best of luck xx,0
im afraid to start keep thinking i wouldnt be able to handle the pressure,0
i had it and anxiety too some people with post natal depression dont bond with their baby but i did but you feel youre all alone and letting your baby down you feel youre not a good mother you think that everybody thinks youre a bad mother you cry all the time my anxiety meant i would not let my baby out of my sight i wouldnt let my husband take him anywhere alone if he did i would be pacing up and down unable to rest till he was back crying all the time he was away from me i felt that i would never see him again that something would happen to him because i wasnt there to protect him i hid it all away from the midwife and health visitor because i was frightened theyd take him off me it was three years later when i was medicated for it i had taken my son to the doctors and she noticed i didnt look right and asked me it all came flooding out and she gave me some prozac to help so please dont leave it like i did go see your gp straight away before it gets any worse my son is 22 now but i remember the nightmare so clearly hope you feel better soon good luck x,0
yvonne sands hello(: so far they make me feel crazy/: i use to take celexa but for some reason when i would take it in the morning around 5oclock at work it would ware off and it felt like my brain friend i was off pills for 3 years but now i have to take something im scared itll get worse for me/: hows life been for you without medicine ?,0

people i know this struggle oh so well i have delt with this bi polar depression all of my 51 years  and it has been one of the biggest challenges of my life i tell you i see it in to ways a curse some of the time and a blessing other times sounds strange yes but true it is a hard journey but i say to each and everyone of you that you all matter you dont drag people down i know its lonely when one is single but we dont have to be lonely there are groups in everyones community who hold meeting on depression etc that really make a difference a difference in their lives as well as your own communication is the key we must break free from being isolated and get out into our safe group of people in the community as they understand us as they wont judge one another for they have issus as well and this wont be the case at all at least please reach out if you are alone we need you to rise up and find your inner strength and go and see if these meetings are for you i believe if you did you would be so proud of yourself to attending as it will be your second wind and an almighty step in the right directionmark my words people do this please you wont regret it these meeting will give you stregnthcourage self esteamand the ability to cope honestly please people take a chance on what im saying as this is the truth i swear and we all need this change from being down when in fact we can be the oppsite and positve and feeling better in our selfs but i was afraid of change and doing something that i wasnt sure of but i tell you all this was the best thing i had ever done in my life i just wished i had of done this a lot soonertake care beautiful people be strong believe that a change will and can come and hope of a brighter day and faith that you can find warmth and inner happiness on a level you are comfortable with thank you all much love and respect to you all kevin pattison xo,0
i feel exactly the same way! i am starting to experience some improvement since being started on the following medication regimen: lithium 600 mg per day lamotrigine 300 mg per day and bupropion xl 150 mg hang in there and try to keep the faith i have been fighting this horrible illness for 5 years i had several occasions where i wanted to give up but i have persevered you can too!,0
you have a right to be upset so vocalize ittell her it upset you not by yelling either and you would appreciate a phone call or text just to let you know whats going ondid you ever stop to think that maybe she didnt know what was going to happen before she left? i am a caregiverhave been since age 18i turn 50 this yearseen alot of miscommunication in hosp and nursing homes so it is very important to communicate with family over the care of your loved one,0
i want to start by telling you i appreciate you wanting to understand better i have lived with it for over 30 years forcing my husband to " live with it also" like you he educated himself the thing i want to tell you most is we are uncurable we are not crazy its not all in our heads and how can we make some one else understand what we dont for me it was finding the right set of medication ( this took years) continual therapy because the meds only help " manage" the symptoms and even with all this help i still have episodes my husband knows he cant fix it but he has learned to communicate with me and when not to sometimes we want to be held sometimes we want to be left alone sometimes when we lose control we need someone to intervene you did the right thing i am betting when your wife slips into a sane moment she will agree its not that we want to die its that we just want these overwhelming feelings to stop read research literature because the better you understand the better her support team to a manageable life,0
that makes so much sense ryan!! i rarely cry when sad or depressed i cry when angry anxious or stressed,0
my meds got switched to lamictal klonopin celexa and something else and i started twitching too almost like restless leg syndrome? im not sure what to do either?,1
yes!!! when ending one med you have to be weened off and not taking any at all is soo soo soo dangerous and scary i will be the first to admit that there is no miracle pill and its not just about taking the right meds you are your best advocate to getting better but we are sick and need the meds too,1
suicide is very real for me as well i am a suicidal person ive had many failed attempts some i dont know how i survived i idealize it on a daily basis ill run through my head how im going to do it so that next time it works i fantasize about death and dying when i hear of someone making a attempt and succeeding i get envious and jealous i just long for the day when ill actually be able to rest in peace and not hurt the way i hurt or feel the feelings that i do i also get envious and jealous of people who dont have the struggles of being suicidal because sometimes i think its not fair but i try and accept it for what it is and i work super close with my therapist once a week to try and change my thinking when i start to go down the suicide road but for the time being i made a pact that i have to be here for my girls (dogs) because nobody will take care of them the way i do keep your head up beautiful and know that you are not alone and we are warriors who battle wars most people couldnt fathom fighting and we make it one day at a time its not a good feeling to be suicidal but it is real and there is support out there were not alone keep your chin up (((((hug))))),0

yeah but people without a mental illness dont seem to get it they say they understand but their patience dissolves into frustration which no doubt its frustrating but how much more is it for those with the illness its like with any illness ailment disease disability or limitation its hard to put yourself in that persons shoes but its always worse for them,0
they have lids for your med bottles that actually have alarms and remind you to refill you can find them at your local pharmacy,1

well i had a medication that triggered night terrors make sure first that its not link to some of your medications otherwise i would have to get up turn on the lights take a bath do something to keep myself from going down the rabbit hole yeah i guess i use distraction techniques to derail my brain,1
when people say they hear voices it is actual voices they hear but you can have intrusive thoughts which when you have them seem to be outwith your control and can be very very strong and loud but that is not same ad actually hearing voices although can be just as distressing especially when thoughts are very ngayive or disturbing,0
lamictal gave me a rash i had the worst reaction to geodon that you can have it effected my speech and coordination thank god i was in the hospital when i was on it got a shot to counter act the effects scary!!,0
not happy u suffer with this but so do i sometimes it is nice to hear someone who struggles with this too just to know u are not alone so many people think this is not real but sadly enough this is very real and extremely hard we will make it,0
just the thought of that makes me anxious ;),0
one thing that helped with my social anxiety was to pick out one thing a person said to follow up on or ask about i fear the awkward silences and pauses i also like using "positive sentence starters" like "oh really? thats so awesome" or "wow i really like that" i dont experience blackouts the way youre describing but i do often find i talk in circles when im anxious,0
seroquel keeps me very stable however i was in too deep of sleeps and was afraid i wouldnt wake up so i just had my dose lowered,1

i suffer from bi-polar 1 i keep a written list of 101 things i love when im depressed i look at it and try to do one or two things like have a cup of tea or light a candle play with the dog it doesnt make the depression disappear but for several minutes im engaged in something else besides my own mental and emotional misery,0

i take effexor and klonipin and have for a long time i was able to get the weight issues evened out after about 6 months and truly dont think it affects me much anymore its been over a decade since i started with them just fyi drinking with benzodiazepines can be dangerous and withdrawal from alcohol and benzos are both very dangerous and usually need to detox medically alcohol withdrawal is often treated with benzos to decrease risk of seizures so please be careful,0
i had to use google before i could start taking meds although there is the rash worry there werent many other side effects that i would be worried about the ratio of help was potentially better i was really surprised!,1
i find it hard dealing with repressed childhood abuse and trauma i havent been diagnosed with bipolar - i have ptsd anxiety and depression you can pull through my darling think about all the things you havent yet achieved think about all the experiences you are yet to gain meditation and conscious breathing help me chill - as well as a spliff when i have money your bf is a c"#nt for saying that!!!!,1

you need your family and friends support! i am bipolar ptsd add and when my problems first started is was sooo hard! i hit the lowest of lows and they could not find the right meds to help it was horrible it took many many drugs and a long time to get somewhat stable but my kids all know my issues and my husband is so understanding about my illness may i ask if you see a psychiatrist and are you on meds if so which ones?,1
you are ill  it is an illness  you can get better with support your husband should be ashamed go to the accident and emergency department at your local hospital they will be able to get the right people involved in your treatment if you need to cry then do it as it is often a good release good luck deep breaths and take it hour by hour xx,1

overthinking is our worst enemy i apply to everything leading to anxiety leading to insanity,1
im pretty sure your in a manic stage when i was manic i looked at everyone and thought they want me im a christian and i felt so guilty about my thoughts it was my chemicals a brain is an amazing thing just look what humans can do but with that said we are full of our own chemicals so when your chemicals are off in your brain our thoughts are distorted my advice is call your doctor and talk to them god bless im stable now and only want sex with my husband ( i still love sex!!),0
im also on both however i attribute my memory loss/poor memory to mental illness because even without the meds i experience it i used to have a great memory but as ive gotten older and my mental health has gotten poorer so has my memory i am 39 and my memory is horrible ive forgotten things ive done or said within the last hour it sucks,0
my assistant pastor told me that it wasnt a "faith statement" to post but for me it is very therapeutic ive found many online/friends turned out to be bipolar suffering depression which helps to know folks know what youre going through its kind of alarming when you realize the numbers too but i post anyway subscribe to pages like this (and on twitter also) and note in a diary app i even created a totally private page with a pseudonym wherein i can post exactly whatever and keep it to myself not on it much but its my page i can understand them being affected because it is pretty weighty id suggest creating a closed or private group and inviting only those folks who are genuinely supportive who want to understand love & prayers!!,0
struggling here too,0
im an impatient perfectionist and the irony is in my life i am creative interior design especially but my "doing" skills lack i would rather be the person with the idea of what the picture should be for others to color!,0
you need to get help that deep of depression osnt something you can help him woth you need a pro but i agree with eveyone else if the threat is real you need to tell someone or get him to a hospital,1
true but chances are higher if its always on the forefront of ones mind mine was like that i hit one stressful situation and attempted suicide im still so close to doing it again and it feels like i get even closer with each passing day i just want the thoughts to stop,0
i have depression severe anxiety and ptsd been diagnosed with all three for well over a decade and i still get up every morning mon-fri to go to work why?? because thats what adults do you ought to try to find a job that fits you rather than decide at 18 that youll spend the rest of your life of disability im not trying to be mean when i say this but damn dont let the disease define you!!,0
especially when you are mentally disturbed,0
my goodness i understand and find myself in a dark place i have to say that i am worried for youi believe that you need to go to your nearest emergency department dont think about it just pack a toothbrush and go you are loved you are needed your are more than enough tell yourself remember that we are all here,0

it was literally a life saver for me i had gone 2 years with only 8 hours of sleep per month my body was shutting down it did make me sleep zyprexa is an anti-psychotic med they have had to put me on it a couple of times when manic or experiencing psychosis if you feel like a zombie the dose is too high i wont even mention how much weight i gained there was no other options for me id say i have a love hate relationship with zyprexa when they took me off of it i still had some pills left this is probably bad advice but when life becomes too overwhelming if i dont have to be anywhere the next day i will take about half a pill for one night im a zombie the next day but its like it resets me no dr ever recommended doing this & im pretty sure my dr would tell me not to do it yet its kept me from killing myself more times than i can count,0
this is reality that kinda scares me,0
oh and jennifer i think your comment is a little broad-brush yes perhaps it is practically impossible to be 100% symptom-free but that doesnt mean someone not taking meds for it doesnt have bipolar i had it for 30 years before i started taking the right meds and i got by just fine - but after taking anti-depressants from my mid 20s i continued to deteriorate rapidly until i was around 30 when a correct diagnosis was made since then ive been markedly "better" but unfortunately a lot of damage was already done to myself and my life and thats now what im struggling with as it amplifies my symptoms,1
i know it upsets me so much its very irritating but i have to calm myself down and educate them not that they ever care because they will tell me it was a joke then i educate them some more it hurts yes but there is still a lot of stigma on mental illness it will take a while to change the world but you can educate one person at a time,0
i was on lamotragine for about a year and it worked great for me but i guess my body got used to it or something and it randomly stopped working and since then ive been struggling for about 6 months trying to find something else that works as well as the lamotragine did,1
i struggle to do all ov them lol just having sum1 to talk to with out them thinking am mad is bad anuf,0
ive dealt with self harming too in more ways than one i purposely bruise myself to relief anger and hate yet at the same time how much hurt i feel for even existing i also deal with more suicidal thoughts more frequently and hell im only 17 my mum wasnt supportive at first she constantly yelled at me for even the smallest things and my doctor and psychiatrists say that its just a way of attention seeking and is greedy because its causing more pain for others than myself i personally feel that no one understand the amount of emotional pain the smallest things effect me my mum only noticed how bad my mental state had gotten when i attempted suicide and kept telling her how much i wanted to die at first she just told me it was teen thing as did the doctors but then i was diagnosed with clinical depression however i feel as if its more than depression because i have traits of bipolar too i didnt self-diagnose myself i know others that are bipolar and they say some of my symptoms are like theirs too now dear i know its hard and im sure many of us have been in your situation before but just know youre not alone in any of this yes people will judge but that shouldnt determine who you really are no one knows you better than yourself dont let others drag you down and i think your mother should come to some sort of understanding that youre suffering with some mental issues (sorry if that comes along rude or anything like that) but instead of yelling at you she should comfort you reassure you and so on and not yell in my personal experience after cutting my wrists and thighs i felt terrible guilt and i wanted to stop so badly but didnt want to feel nothing because cutting myself made me feel something i still wanted to stop so what i did was id get an elastic band or hair band and keep it around my wrist and just ping the hair band/elastic band onto my wrist or arm as hard as i could and it may leave a red mark but it wont scar or anything take deep breathes too 5 seconds inhaling 7 seconds exhaling and continue until you feel okay crying is also okay to do youre human so its okay to cry if you feel alone remember youre not alone there are people out there who are just like you whether you know them or not itll all get better eventually i assure you sweetheart i hope my words have some sort of help for you and im sorry also if i made it seem all about me i just wanted to show you that youre not alone ,0
i just read an article on emdr on the mighty and the author says it was a lot less scary than she thought it was going to be and it benefitted her a lot if i find the article ill post it here,0

its safe to say youre not ok and you need to take your meds anxiety wont just go away without the aid of medication,1
sorry to distract from original post of abuse when referring to myself i say i am bipolar it is a personal choice to decide it is woven through the very core of me i am not ashamed of it nor quiet about it i am medicated and have worked hard to remove co-existing personality disorder now cured of that (yes perdis are curable with hard work) i am high functioning most of the time when im not i take time off from life so-to-speak to recover most people except employers know of my struggles at least depression,0

unfortunately side effect if many antipsychotic and mood stabilizing drugs is weight gain sedation is also a side effect of many hence they are used at low doese for sleep there are loads of different medications and what works for o e person may not work for another  sadly only way of finding out is to try them it is trial and error i take it by say you bipolar anxiety and bipolar depression you mean you have bipolar disorder? ive no idea what country you are from so i dont know what healthcare system you need to clearly explain your symptoms and that side effects are outweighing the benefits of medications and discuss others you can try,1

it really depends often my own experiences etc are what make me awesome at my job cause people can tell that i genuinely empathize and my knowledge/experience allows to better help others but sometimes i find the stress/work hours/sometimes even the environments etc of nursing negatively impact my own mental health i love what i do know i am good at it but in all honestly there have been times ive considered changing careers and theres times i do struggle a bit really its something you have to decide on your own :) best wishes,0
been on 40 mg for about a year i really didnt notice a difference i was hoping it would help but make sure you take it after you eat because with me it can upset the stomach pretty bad and i was told it doesnt even work unless you take it with at least 300 calories,1
elevated hr elevated blood pressure increased anxiety sweating weight loss,1
i think the fear of "not having anywhere else to go" is so often a sort of crutch that is used to stay in an abusive relationship i think you need to take that leap and end it - the rest will get figured out and i think that youll find its less scary and less impossible than it seems sending hugs and courage to you <3,0

keep writing  dont worry about the spelling you are your best therapist,1
do you go to counseling or therapy to help you cope and work on your grief?? i would do that first and foremost then get into an aa place stop drinking its not benefiting you on anyway shape or form from their work with your doctor or psychiatrist to cut down on some of those added medications that you might not need once youre in counseling and able to deal with anxiety and grief and also with the drinking because thats doing a number on your system as well i cant understand what youre going through but i have been addicted to drugs in the past and then on multiple antidepressants and anti-anxiety pills which i am no longer on if anything from where anybody is suggesting to you and trying to help please get into counseling and if you dont like your first counselor find another one its totally worth it its hard its frustrating it brings up feelings you dont want to face  but its totally worth it to gain your sanity and your self-worth and a purpose in life,1
see a psychiatrist and try to get to the core of your anxiety she will probably want to see you regularly and prescribe anti anxiety meds,1
i have bipolar depression and anxiety no medication & no fking insurance ,1

i had no idea this was part of my condition no dr or therapist ever mentioned it they always mention drugs or alcohol but never sex so i was embarrassed to say anything about it thanks to everyone who was open to help others,0
it can be so hard as the other post suggested they cant be pushed recovery from anxiety or depression can feel so painfully slow for the sufferer and those close to them i was in a similar position with a son the same age the most important thing i learned is for them is to know they can rely on you 100% not to push them too far too fast not to falter not to give up and to be there others come and go some dont understand this is where the loneliness can come in for them when they feel they are different not coping or when their friends dont have time for them when they feel they can t control the mental illness when it doesnt make sense when it takes over and they cant see it getting any better the one person they usually need to count on is their mum even though they are a young adult they are still young still vulnerable and still needing a huge amount of support gentle encouragement to move forward of course is necessary but it has really to be governed by them at the pace they feel comfortable with hopefully small achievable steps will lead on to more every achievement however small it might seem to others will hopefully spur them on drawing on past evidence to help them see they are doing well they are moving forward one particularly bad time with us was the eve of a big school trip early this year the first one in the whole of his schooling he felt able to go on at the last minute he couldnt go it was too big for him i tried everything in my power to convince him to go i thought it was time to throw in the towel i thought if he couldnt do that he d never be able to do anything he just said mum i need you to understand if i havent got you on my side ive got nothing it is just too big to do at this time please dont make me i quickly learned an important lesson at this point in his life it was too much for him to cope with he explained it didnt mean that sometime in the future he might feel strong enough hes gone on to secure a job recently which was beyond my wildest dreams i never thought it possible to overcome the anxiety of an interview anything is possible but of course its not easy mental illness is debilitating sometimes its heartbreaking to see a loved one go through it we can feel so powerless when as a parent we want to fix and protect the hardest thing is we cant always do that best wishes and good luck x apologies some of the punctuation on my ipad wont work,0
ive got it also and add anxiety panic paranoid psyco hypomanic im manic and down for days most weeks but maybe we can help each other hit me up,1
my mother has had quite the battle over the years struggling to find the right diagnosis and medications to help with them she lost my father and all five of her kids when we were growing up ( she also partook in drugs/alcohol so that didnt help matters) now im 29 and for the last decade or so ive been able to have a good relationship with her and shes a phenomenal grandmother to my boys she tried to takeher life many times as well in the past and much like yourself she was always saved (and sometimes just barely) i guess the point of all of this is to just let you know that it does get better you cant take away the past and any mistakes youve made but you do have the option for a brighter future! dont give up please your daughter still needs you no matter how old she may be right now and im sure there are many who love you despite your trials let the medicine help and find your voice with your doctors if they dont youve got this feel free to pm me if you ever want me to share more ❤,0

ive had digestive issues due to anxiety since i was a kid i was involved in music and theatre and would either throw up or have uncontrollable diarrhea before i performed it got even worse after i had my gallbladder out if i had errands to run and was going to eat out eating had to be last because i would have to go straight home they used to call ibs having a "nervous stomach" so yes anxiety can manifest itself through your digestive system,1
when it was just 20 pounds i accepted it but now that its 50+ lbs i think its unacceptable my primary dr is upset he says he gives remeron to his patients that need to gain weight he also said i could become diabetic so frustrated!,0

as an aside my littles (4 9 and 9) dont sleep due to night terrors and anxiety and melatonin and meditation apps are all were doing no doctor here would give them anything else pure parental suffering and no sleep for ten years theyre getting better with time but its been rough i feel for your mom,1

bipolar type 2 & anxiety i take 150 mg lamotragine 2x a day 40 mg latuda 15 mg buspirone 2x a day and 05 mg clonazepam as needed but usually only once a day as well as something for high blood pressure and hypothryroidism just recently started the latuda so still getting used to it rapid cycling a bit now but still seems to be a better combo than what i was on before hopefully it gets better but i do understand its hard to be on a lot of meds but if its working for you thats all that matters! ,1
i know its hard to see even one day ahead some times you feel so so horrible and its like your life is just a living hell i get that and understand completely just try your best to get through one day at a time as best you can it takes time to start to feel better and thats the part that sucks as you just want to feel better tomorrow!!!! it will slowly get better and who knows what lies ahead for you in your life once you get through this terrible time in your life its such a hard hard time for you but hang on as tight as you can xxxx hugs to you xx,0
i am 36 years old and cut whenever anxiety is way too much for me sometimes its because of the numbness other times its because i feel way too much pain on the inside i have bipolar 1 and bpd i take a cocktail consisting of 7 different pills every day some every 4 hours for some reason cutting is like "therapy" for me,0
i agree lithium has been my wonder drug research it i am on the lowest dose it sounds scary but educate yourself on it and youll see it differently i feel like it has given me peace in my life when i had never really known what that felt like,0
the thing that gets me upset is that the ones who say it are usually the ones that put up the mental illness support memes on their facebook page,0
lots of ugly on seroquel lol it is highly effective at treating anxiety/psych issues if you dont mind eating the house down makes you starving!!!!! and lots of people gain serious weight myself 60#,1
stop taking it personally and trying to be her savior use your understanding to recognize that her symptoms cannot be relieved by you what works for you might likely not work for her she must find her way for herself your job is not yo fix her only support she is probably pulling away from the pressure you are putting on her not to isolate shes going to isolate like it or not its part of the symptomology,1
i have bipolar ii gad sad bpd ptsd and mdd being borderline sucks that combined with my anxiety makes the worthlessness seem even more scary,1

do you only take anxiety medication!!! you might need more medication depending on symptons!,1
hang in there my sons father takes 60mg cymbalta every morning and has done for years he takes protein shake in the morning which gives him energy ⚡ try that its a good drug,1
what a horrible message to reinforce to someone who struggles so they have enough issues with self defeat they need to see messages of their worth,0
it is a cruelier disease than any physcial one if people see a broken limb or a disabilty that is visably seen they believe the person is in pain bi polar comes in all forms mild to severe my wife as it mild with other health issues and everyday she as to get up and paint on that smile for the sake of our son he is only reason why she does exist as she tells me it is a scary thing to live with and you feel helpless but you do what you can to support the person and hope others in their life do  trouble is my wife gives 100 per cent of herself into all her relationships and we all abuse her kind good nature and when she gets ill or angry where are we still expecting for her to be supporting us we the selfish ones when she does breakdown no one calls no one stops and values her me included and why should she put up with it like all bi polar sufferers she wants people who are geninune in her life and wont pretend or lie to hershe as the guts to do this so why cant we all be like it for her?,0
cant speak for the first two but the last; matrazipine quiets the mind and makes you sleepy and more relaxed has helped me sleep without anxiety (mostly),1
you may want to seek out a second opinion it may be medical causing everything to escalate i always has managable anxiety then last summer i experienced extremely high stress for no reason and out of control anxiety i was fatigued every waking moment coupled with all kinds of weird symptoms that made no sense a year later i now deal with a diagnosis of ms which increasea anxiety for no reason makes you tired and weak all the time have optic neuritis raynalds disease wilsons syndrome heat makes those and others magnified while i have always had anxiety now its a major part of ms i was diagnosed last fall at 40 it can happen at any age and heat with humidity makes attacks happen you may want to consider looking into an auto immune somehow its all related,1
i am so sorry that you have been through so much at such a young age you can get through this you need a good doctor to work closely with you it may be that you will need to continue on medication and counselling even when you feel better because going off to college and studying will be stressful and you will need to be able to cope,1
i had a long bar because my tongue was thick so i could turn it sideways and clinch my molars on it i tap syllables with my molars when im having bad anxiety so i did it with the bar instead,0
because nobody wants to deal with someone elses misery there is no kindness or compassion only selfishness,0
im like this im fine until i start getting close to work then my stomach aches and i get nauseous and sweaty im actually unemployed right now for that very reason its gets so bad sometimes that i just shut down and become a recluse im medicated and i still have problems with my anxiety and depression like you i try to focus on the positive and some days that works but the thoughts in my head and the feeling in my stomach takes over everything its debilitating and scary but i just keep pushing on and trying my damnedest to stay positive for my family good luck and lots of prayers,0
my sibling was on lithium and it severely damaged her kidneys and created other issues for her scary stuff,0
eliminate triggers be industrious take medication if you need it but dont use your illness or meds as an excuse and make others responsible for your condition go to work the less time you have to think about things the less mania that can result and also people only give people the benefit of the doubt when you are well from my personal experience stand up dont be a victim and if you need meds take them regardless of anyone! poor judgement whatever if you eliminate triggers you are as normal as anyone else take care!!,1
im just scared because the nature of my job is fairly dangerous and i dont want them to come back and say im not fit for the job ive been doing the same thing at other companies for 2 years and its my passion i dont want to lose my job there are no other options in that industry ive gone through them all,0
one because it will not only hurt you but everyone who cares about you for a long time two because if you dont get it right youll probably end up worse off than you are now are you willing to risk it either way? theyre the only reasons i am still here plus the fact death could be worse you never know,0
hiim not bipolar i have suffered from anxiety depression and ptsd  soooo im with you would these same people use the word "retarded"?!?maybe ask themwe know its not correct to say that some people need to be alerted to others feelings ,0

okay every time i go to my gp they just offer me antidepressants i finally found a counsellor who gave me different coping methods for depression not one person listen to me when i try and talk about the difference in my days some days i can hardly motivate myself to move other then to grab the worst of food and binge eat till i feel sick and online shop other days i wake up and i clean the whole flat in an hour and we are all up dressed and ready to get out the flat and spend the day out doing things that i can really afford i find my hard days are always triggers by the silliest things someone told me ive done something wrong at work or ive felt the tiniest bit rejected by a loved one or ive been in a flunk for over an hour so now my whole day now ends up that way before learning slightly heather coping mechanisms i used to drink a bit party hard and use sex as a way to escape from the overwhelming feeling of being stuck in my head but evening with these new coping skills i feel like there is never just a normal day i try to trust my gp and tell myself its just depression and maybe its anxiety that makes me feel like its more then what it is what are you thoughts?,0
aftet a thirty year struggle just found a shrink who tells me the only way is a combo of meds and psycho therapy had both before but not together looking forward to the next stage of the journey its all a learning curve to those of you out there that are still in the acute phasese hold tbe the faith love light and peace,0
i am a fellow soldier in this battle unlike a lot of people who comment day in and day out i fight & deal with dark thoughts lack of motivation fatigue stress anxiety and now i have recently discovered the possibility that i may also be dealing with ptsd as well regardless i have no other option but to fight it out i dont have insurance; the few times that i have gone to the doctor regarding this crap all its accomplished is costing me money without resolution the doctor wants me in therapy for a year before we investigate medication alternatives the counselors that i have visited with want to talk about the trite & trivial issues de jour instead of giving ideas or suggestions as to workable solutions i know all too well what hell this fight is yet when i share what i am doing people here argue about the natural solutions depression is an ugly thing but with it are many valuable lessons those of us who are not cherry know we can tell when a person is complaining because whining is the only attention they get or when a person is pouring out the b-s just to get the drugs i wish you the best in solving this problem if that is really what you want,0
your not alone my friends have moved away even really really good friends and i barely hear from them you sound a bit like me fear abandonment i have my blended family (which offers enough stress) and work and pretty much no friends im tired of being the one trying to maintain contact its sad but dont really have friends the last couple i lost were not real friends in the end,0
prayer and bible study seriously learning that god wants the best for everyone and that he wants me to "flee from sexual immorality"(1 corinthians 6:18) and to "abstain from sexual immorality each one of you should know how to control his own body in holiness and honor not with greedy uncontrolled sexual passion" (1 thessalonians 4:3-5) has quite literally helped me to overcome this disorder you can win this battle too it includes keeping busy in "holy acts of conduct and deeds of godly devotion" getting your mind off your sexual urges and desires prayer serious prayer begging for help to control your passions is vital you can find more bible information on this topic at woljworg where you can search for published articles on bible topics it would be wise to seriously consider beginning the free bible study program from jehovahs witnesses you can request one on their website: jworg,1
i am alone as i go through my days with this awful deasese i fight n fight but i feel know one caes nor does anyone love me the world is so cold n lonely who to turn to becuz when i turn there is know one so i hold my head down n cry as i know im nothing i am worthless i struggle n struggle but im only me,0
thats horrible and rude of her,0
we can all understand because the battles we fight are the samejust multiplied infinitely for each of us we see the dawn and feel powerful yet minutes later are worried about the dusksuch is our beauty and our curse a new person is wonderful until they wish to become close a rain cloud the harbinger of life and moments later a torrent which washes our self awayalways we are both life and death light and dark heaven and helland we can never escapeyet we are the most joyful beings in the universe :),0
unfortunately im not sure what to tell you about your housing situation i dont know where you live and if social services will help but if your really worried about your housing situation maybe you can try and get into a shelter it may not be ideal but its better than being homeless for the most part i know that sounds like bad advice and im sorry i did live in two shelters myself i didnt enjoy it but i did take steps to better myself there and hopefully you can too and as far as the relationship goes maybe you can talk with your ex boyfriend/friend and see if he is still willing to give you emotional/social support i know its hard because one or both of you may still have feelings but it might be worth a shot but if your too nervous to do that you can reach out to me im a great listener and i really like to make people feel better and open to me just some food for thought i wont be offended if you dont want to,0
i just know first hand the carnage the suicide of a close relative leaves behind i cant go into detail on here but the repercussions can be huge there must be another way when i was sofa bound day after day week after week i wanted to escape this life i was supposedly living but i knew that escape wasnt the answer there is always hope for a better life but it takes a huge amount of determination and resilience are you certain your girls dont love or need you? i know we can have some very strange thoughts of ourselves and loved ones when we are struggling it is so hard i know but recovery is out there try to examine whats not working and what needs to be changed reach out for help lean on those who love you dont give up x,0
i was tapering off in january and it was a fairly horrible experience- lots of body aches and pains and just felt like i had the flu all the time plus totally emotionally all over the place- eventually decided i was tapering too fast (50 mg a week) and when i slowed down it got a bit better i got to 200 mg and stopped and then later got a horrible mania so had to go back to 250 but refused to go back any higher,0
i struggled for 24 yrs with substance abuse  i clean now 7  10 yrs clean,0
bipolar 1 panic disorder ptsd adhd with years of mds practicing on me now on lamictal and lithium i no longer i need anti-anxiety medication or sleep medication i had to find the right dr who was actually listening to me and it took me years to figure out that medical doctors need to stop thinking they can do a psychiatric doctors job although e even in the beginning of that relationship im a lot more medication than that ever truly hard at meditation natural herbs essential oils anything that i can do to not have to swallow one more pill im down to two!,1
hahahah id make sure i just reply "youre*" to avoid confusion ,0
really sorry you are feeling so desperately unwell when suicidal thoughts are so persistent you may need to be in hospital for a while try to remember what has helped you improve in the past i wish you well and i am speaking from many years of mental illness,1
you can get one of those pay after you win lawyers so you dont have to go to court all the time i get super anxious about stuff like this too but keep pushing forward any little bit of progress is still progress,0
along with meds i suggest adding some vitamins and minerals i struggled with severe depression for years and feel like vitamin b 12 saved my life it can be found it in a pill form or you can have your vitamin levels checked and get injections some people like me dont absorb b12 correctly so injections are the only method that works for me i also recently started taking magnesium tablets which have greatly reduced my anxiety i hope things get better for you very soon ,1
simonchini was found guilty of manslaughter back in 2006 and jailed he killed 9 of his patients by injecting baking soda into them worth a try? no thanks!,1
forgive me as im not aware of this schoeffective disorder and couldnt find anything online so ill just consider the anxiety as that is something i have more experience of as a mother of a teenage son with acute anxiety it can be so so hard as a parent we want to fix things make everything ok and if we cant we can feel so helpless its such an awful feeling to see your son suffer so much acute anxiety can be so crippling many people just dont realise some even completely dont understand or wrongly assume we just want to make everything ok and when we cant we can feel a failure at times when sometimes there just isnt anything we can do to make things ok with my son one of the main things he needed and relied upon was my strength resilience understanding and knowing i was always there for him through thick and thin if i was to falter or push him into something he wasnt happy with then i know he couldnt have coped i believe they need loved ones to understand and be there for them it is hard enough to deal with the problems it makes everything so much worse when they believe people dont understand one of most frustrating things ive found about mental illness is the slow rate of recovery and being able to move forward it can take so long to build up the confidence needed to be able to do things when we crave the day when our children and young people can essentially be able to live a normal life it can be heartbreaking to see them struggling with a half life battling with their demons on a daily basis when we see others their peers living happy fruitful and care free lives it is so hard to know what our young people are going through especially when we see their youth disappearing not being able to fulfill their potential not being happy sometimes its just too painful to really contemplate and its better for our own sanity to just focus on the here and now and try to put our energies into the daily challenges because progress can seem so painfully slow eg getting a job learning to drive its important to try to focus on smaller steps smaller goals by gentle encouragement and with kind praise and empathic reinforcement it has to be more their pace than ours as frustrating as it often is quite often unfortunately the pressure this brings on us has adverse effects and can lead to mental health problems for the parent/s who bare the lions share of the stress we arent always strong enough which makes things extra hard do you have any other professional support for you or your son? it can feel so isolating when you see others effectively leading normal lives things can get better its finding that way forward to beat the conditions so they can control it rather than it controlling them this can come with maturity and using each productive experience as evidence that they have overcome their anxiety on a particular day or in a specific activity im sure you are doing a wonderful job and together as a team things will get better but unfortunately it can take a lot of time care and patience best wishes x,0
if you are worried about your physical safety him having your house keys and all call the police and make a report then call mental health services in whatever state you live in and the police report will help fast track your brother to being seen and evaluated cant imagine what youre going through but the outbursts and threats/ physical violence are a priority in this situation,0
seriously i did 3 months and i have been so fine i came off meds im currently doing another 2 months (after a year) to lose the last of it but the 12 months between doses i had 1 episode of hypomania (so not full blown) and no depression with reduced anxiety and thats on no psych meds except occasional valium for anxiety triggers (ptsd),1
yupthats meid crawl through broken glass to avoid conflict ,0
ill give you this advice from someone suffering from bipolar anxiety bpd and ptsd there will be times she wont want to get out of bed dont force her just lay there beside her and cuddle there will be times she doesnt want to leave the house dont make her she wont want to go anywhere by herself dont make her you will become her sage place she will become extremely insecure about the dumbest thingsbuy her flowers cook her dinner dont put her down when all she wants to do is sleep when you ate dealing worn these disease it takes a lot of motivation to get up and hey tatu because we dread going into public because we think everyone is taking about us and see what is wrong with us remind her all the time that tipu love hey because when she is depressed she will forget and get desperate and think she is a burden to you and think that being a burden on you,0
im talking about cannabis sativa or indica strains or hybrids can really help people,0
i gave up on the citalapram - it gave me that restless leg syndrome i had to take it at night just before bed otherwise it made me feel quite ill best thing i *ever* found for the anxiety/hyper-vigilance phases (i got ptsd too) are beta-blockers  theyre fkcing great saved my life a thousand times,0
im on lithium and anxiety meds too i have bipolar 1,1
try to get help with your doctor because they have medication for anxiety and they will help you a lot good luck,1
i was 16 when i was diagnosed now 32 i find its always a roller coaster! if you know your triggers that can help a little to avoid things from getting so "bumpy" i had to stop all alcohol which i was just a casual drinker once i became of age but i got into bad manic phases from that then your lows randomly stopping my meds made everything worse but then having my first child while i wasnt under the supervision of a psychiatrist was the worst! i got postpartum psychosis!! that was a nightmare but i then found an amazing doctor i was later stable and had a second baby and it was if my hormones shifted my whole brain into a state of stablness id never had before!!! anyhow life isnt always darkness or pain there are good times but this illness is a beast! and we do have to continue to fight it! having a great support system great trusted doctor or doctors is key as well! but there are good and great days in your future but just remember it will be a roller coaster! dont give up! dont give in! i hope it gets better for you soon!,1
the most awful feeling is being estranged from your children and when youre bpd/ptsd/anxiety/ocd/adhd etc that feeling without your family is magnified by 100x its the worst feeling in the world youre not selfish you just feel more than others take your daughter to dinner- tell her happy mothers day- without you; she wouldnt be here tell her you love her and just enjoy the moment- doesnt matter what day it is youre still m❤m remember: just as you suffer from these debilitating titles so do our children- they are hurt by our hurt and relationships are affected by the slightest be patient and selfless time is on your side happy mothers day!,0
lithium withdrawal happens quickly with dissociative states messed up blood pressure dizziness disorientation lightheadedness confusion and after a few weeks possible organ failure effexor withdrawal takes 6-9 days to kick in and includes tremors hot flashes chills sweating fatigue inability to sleep nausea/vomiting dizziness severe headache and sudden severe depression (typically worse than your depression was to begin with) i was on lithium 1200mg for 8 years and experienced withdrawal once after 3 days when my mom was in the hospital for 3 days and only she had access to my meds (they were locked up) ive been on effexor for about 3 years now and experienced withdrawal once after 6 days when i was put in jail for 10 days (for missing community service) and they took 6 days to get my meds ordered both i was warned about when i was put on he meds in the first place of the importance of not missing them or letting myself run out because these withdrawal problems are real and intense and i experienced every single withdrawal symptom both times except with the lithium i wasnt off long enough for organ failure to set in,1
i know this feeling all too well but you have to learn to laugh one time at work years ago ill never forgetthis chic just out in the open office "i cant stand bipolar people they scare me they should all be locked up medicated or not",0
never be scared to help your mind when its failing you ive been 4 times and it saved my life reach out get help dont suffer when you dont have to best of luck!,0
i was here with no insurance and no hope i went to the er and committed my self my cutting scars are getting fainter as i age but i struggle every day the hospital got me connected with dr and programs that are free or sponsored please your understood you matter you can find another job or take a leave of absence please the hospital signed off my bills for hardship you are the one step from away from the right direction take it you are here,0
i remember my 1st time in a psych ward security guards were called twice to hold down patients to give them a shot and put them in the quiet observation room i was scared to death and add that onto my psychosis and eventually i was the one held down and shot in the backside and in a quiet room now i have greater control of my own mental health and i am lucky enough to have the option of checking in to a private facility before i get bad enough for shots and quiet rooms i have medication but the thing that really helped me was seeing a psychologist yes we dug up some painful memories that hadnt dealt with like child abuse and rape and a violent father but my psychologist taught me tools that i could use to take charge of my mental illness rather than have my illness control me if you can handle it give it a second chance if they want you to bring up stuff you dont feel safe doing ask them about cbt and tools you can use to help you cope with this illness instead once you build up some trust perhaps then can you start digging i have bipolar i and while im not always stable like at the moment i feel depressed thanks to chronic pain i think im doing ok it can happen you can learn to live with this and be in control it just takes time and a lot of hard work take care and good luck,0
now thats a real anxiety attack! i have had to pull over on the side of road or in a parking lot to call my mother because she knows exactly what to say to me to calm me down,0
jenn if i may ask did cymbalta put on weight or is it still too soon to tell im ready to give meds another shot out of desperation i have a bit of a problem dealing with weight gain some say i have an eating disorder once i start packing the weight on i automatically quit the med sounds petty but it is just me,1
i went though 2 break down my depression was so bad and anxiety what go me though was eating healthy food i seen social worker and used breathing in and out to help me calm and i use we go to the water a lot look over and sea waves and hear them relaxes youand i use to take magnesium it help your nerves and cramps and neck pain i use to get a lot of that from my anxiety i went and seen a natural doctor ,1
you must try xx you will probably suffer and then you might not xx take the risk and let us know how you get on xx we all love you either way you have been strong xxxxxxxx,0
and i too am a percentage of laziness  with huge bouts of un laziness but i cant seem to do those adult things i always mean to but i dunno y i just dont follow thru until my mum was murdered she was amazing she gently coaxed me from my dark hole others try to push and threatened and gave up a constant rock is the most wobderful saviour for mental illness,0
causes paranoia,1
its such a shame that companies will work with people with other illnesses but as soon as it comes down to mental illness its frowned on i with diagnosed with bipolar disorder/ manic depression/ anxiety when i was 12 years old im 24 now and i have always had to hide my mental illness from jobs until now when i finally got wrote up for the second time and i couldnt handle the fact of losing my job i really hope things work out for you because i know the feeling of having that laying on the back of your mind bringing you down its hard but with the right support (your meeting) it sounds like you are doing what you can to get yourself back on track i need to get into some kinda therapy or something again with all the shit going on right now i feel myself slowly falling and im scared i wont be able to catch myself,0
i suffer from bipolar mdd ptsd psychosis and anxiety/panic disorder i suffered since age 13 i tried every medication out there i got so bad in october i did 16 rounds of ect it was a life changer for me then it wore off so we tried lithium and vraylar quetiapine and prozac and it brought me back up there is a treatment and medication out there it takes time to find it i researched alot myself and luckily my dr was listening to me and was willing to try new things keep trying never give up hope it took 25yrs to get to where i am at today,1
im pretty familiar with ssri meds if i had to guess this is probably more for anxiety or sedation medication i have been on seroquel before dont believe i was on the xr as far as being worried because ssri dont agree with you this isnt of the ssri medications,1
yes im currently taking for bipolar mixed i was previously taking it as a heart medication was hospitalized for bipolar and then restarted on propranolol i believe it helps with the anxiety that physically manifests into an abnormal heart arrhythmia one can be connected to the other,1
i agree if you think you might need to go than its time i just got out of the hospital and i can honestly say i was way more scared of what i might do than going into the hospital,0
honestly almost all of memory loss stems from my depression anxiety and ptsd im slightly better with my memory when on the right medication,1
its also an antidepressant i was on it for almost 2years for depression anxiety and ocd i thought it was great until i forgot to take it if i missed a day i was all over the place and would be mentally screwed for the day i was even at the point where i selfharmed which is definitely not me everyone is different tho,1
im recovering as well and i journal all my worries for the day and then tear them up and throw them away then i meditate for 10 minutes it has really helped me,0
tell them your concerns i had issues with opiates in the past and i told them what i was worried about and what i was hoping to accomplish with meds great way to start looking for the right meds combo,1
such a life sit try figure if take right amount of sleeping pills to sleep to feel better or take all the sleeping pills and never worry about feeling ever again,1
i have bipolar and a lot of anxiety i have that feeling every morning lately even though im on my meds it just started out the blue i force myself up but cannot get motivated till at least 11am its horrible i wish i can just be normal !!! hope this does not go on too long as i cannot carry on like this,0
i became quickly addicted to benzos after two weeks when i didnt know about their side effects it took me six months to get off be careful with addictive anti anxiety meds its probably better that you dont take them in the long run i used depakote to get off of klonopin it worked really well completely solved the withdrawal problems i was having,1
if i lived in the moment my anxiety would be worse but thanks for the unhelpful and insensitive advice,1
put on like 20kgs with seroquel in like 6 weeks so came of that cymbals was great to start with but anxiety levels were high and it stopped working after about 6mths,1
i liked lithium but it gave me nightmares/night terrors,0
ambien is the devil did stuff without remembering horrible i will never take it again eventually i had to have my then 9 year old start hiding my keys at night,0
if you dont feel ready you shouldnt feel pressured into getting pregnant again he shouldnt expect you to either,0
every day i struggle with that,0
topamax for my migraines and it has done nothing for my weight cymbalta for my anxiety nothing for weight either,1
i went out and didnt spend the whole of the next day worrying about what i said,0
my husband understands most of the timebut he has severe heart problems and tries to make up the differencemakes me feel guilty and ashamed of feeling like shit all the timeday 4 no showerno energy:(,0
ok so i have major depressive disorder was on cymbalta for a few years when i recently realized i was sleeping til 4-5 pm and really no interest in anything checked into heritage eastside behavioral hospital so i could see my psyc doc ( most psychiatrists dont take medicare as an outpatient) he switched me to effexor which seemed to work better but it is a serotonin norephrine reuptake inhibitor from what i have researched its the norephrine that provides a boost in energy it already seems to have leveled off in effectiveness at 75 mg i need more energy still since im dealing with a pc physician now any thoughts on suggestions i will bring up to her ie upping dosage etc? everyone of you out there experiencing these problems stay strong this coming from a former ngc cadet!,1
i got seroquel after that and it worked wonders should have got it first maybe it was scary ,1
not ssris because there is an increased risk of suicide in teens when they are on them,0
yes my thoughts exactly i am on a lot of medication and live with the side effects everyday because my 4 kids need a mum who is semi- functional if i dont take me meds woaah- scary stuff can happen,1
i am the mom and wife to three very functional and amazing bipolar folks medication therapy lots of exercise and my daughter will tell you avoid junk food--the sugar high and low exacerbates the symptoms,1
its different for everyone it might not be too much for u i wasnt really allowed to make the desicion most of my life and when i had a panic attack or got depressed my mom saw that as not enough meds be careful and listen to what suits u im on lithium and seraquil ( pretty sure thats how u spell it ) but im on a lil less now at 14 i was on so much lithium i started shaking amd getting dizzy and blurred vision u really just gotta talk to ur doctor,1
the one i use is called alarmy you can set it to "end alarm by scanning barcode taking a picture or my shaking your phone a set number of times" :) i have to shake mine 50 times twice in the morning so i actually wake and get up nora kale,1
that would be horrifying i rarely have nice dreams almost always nightmares the higher my stress levels are the more intense and real they seem,0
three seems kind of weird also to be diagnosed at three and then not treating you until your 4? what exactly do you mean blood drawn at 4 1/2? i dont want to sound rude but i am here for information and support i am new to all this and very scared i would really be quite pissed to be honest if someone was saying they have a sickness they dont have,0
game changing exercise wt loss healthy balanced diet avoid alcohol,1
i was on latuda but it levelef out after awhile im off of it now im bi polar too with anxiety and a touch of agoraphobia (thats not wanting to leave your place) i have to force myself to go places sometimes im on lamictal and am on welbutrin busar for anxiety i still have not much energy but enough to go about my daily things which alot are a regular routine all i know to do is tell my meds dr about whats going on and whether you think your meds are doing you any good try n stay positive,0
i also have bipolar and have been on a lot of different medications im not sure they even work half the time so im fostering kittens its the only reason i get up or stay up i also have a service dog coming soon so ill have to train her ( i dont know how thats going to seeing how i also have extreme social anxiety) im not sure any of that helped im so sorry for your loss,1
i always tell people that is interested in being friends with me or romantically envolved with me at the beginning so they will understand the reason for my actions or me needing my personal space when one doesnt know its always quick to judge that theyre insane and youll be surprise on how many suffers the same thing but to embarrass to talk about it until the other talks about it first,0
candice alexis my aunt has also had this treatment and her memory has been blown she cant drive because she forgets what the colors of lights mean stop go and caution its incredibly scary and she is not even close to the same person with or without depression hang in there! it took years and years of med trial and error i feel ok with the meds im taking now but i hoped for more improvement i guess push forward an keep on keeping on!,1
yenz maelstrom yes ive kept my job for 18 years but it hasnt been without the odd major blip the key for me was to religiously take my medication behind all the craziness of my illness was a little bit of logic i desperately wanted the same things as everybody else to have as much of a normal life as possible there are times where this is not possible because of the illness but i keep trying working for me its a distraction from being unwell it isnt easy but i keep at it i have recently been treated for breast cancer and i am on the phased return to work at the moment after being off for five months i think to myself what else can life throw at me whatever life does throw at me i will fight it as hard as i can ,0
it took me a few years to be completely rid of the brain shakesick,1
monday i bought a ukulele and today i can already play a couple songs this past week ive definitely spent a lot of time loving that and practicing and not just laying in bed doesnt have to be that in particular but if its music sports art anything he has a natural interest in maybe try to encourage him from that angle but other then that youre doing good just gentle suggestions/encouragement is best the anxiety that comes with depression can even make love and concern seem overbearing my parents have learned to balance they talk to me and tell me they love me every day but if i dont respond to texts or calls they know i probably just need some me time,0
gabapentin worked miracles for me for me it was like a benzo propranolol also worked for the anxiety in my body,1
its so horrible what some of the side effects are,0
and hv u felt a lot better since on new mess ive struggled and was first diagnosed at 14 with manic depression but wouldnt take any medication and as got older having ft chiyoung it was tough and through a baby equipment loan service got close to a worker there who introduced me to start of her other career in teaching all ability classs which i went to to support her and within 2 or 3 years by age of 2yrs went to college with no schooling previous and got my first destinctionsto go on further and was teaching classs first class was else i know leisure pool never forget it full class but real women from all walks who supported me for many years i realised fitness was soon to be a form of good medication not that it didnt stop the highs and lows because it didnt but found when i felt anxious or starting to feel hyper mainly through days and as u know day gos on and that elevated mood waking up feeling like u could take on the world and boone wud stop from sometimes achieving a lot more then was actually possible and not saying that if work hard anything is possible but from suffering with bi-polar personality disorder postromatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder im coming from a women as in suffering mental health and when in that elevated state can let myself get carried away in ambitions to the point i think and thought i might be gifted in a spiritual way but wont get into that bit lolbeen through many traumas from a child growing up to rite now at 48years old to something happening 10years agomonth afta last and my world was turned upside down i started to take medication as cud read do my normal routine which is something i needed to being able to function bringing up three kids on my own from my daughter being a year and half and her 2 big brothers to building a home working hard sometimes 50hours a week paying childminders aftanoon school clubs morning clubs and so on as i cud the break that routine as new if did i would get confused agitated up and down and left my ex partner because i started being violent with him which obviously ended up both ways and new myself it would cause damage they had seen to much so decided only way forward was to split and bring my kids up using my career as a fitness instructor and aerobics instructor to feed my bring rather then those mess to finally moving 6 years bk i cant get in detail but new if didnt leave i was starting to sink my daughter was going through to much trauma to deal with what was happening to eventually giving in and said id take the medication any thing from mood stabilisers

fluoxetine worked great for my depression but made my anxiety worse sending prayers and love,1
dont worry about relationships god will send him when hes ready learn to love yourself first maybe you could take electives until you decide what you want to do with college early education is a good field to get in to we always need teachers good luck to you on your journey ,0
i know it costs money any goes against many beliefs but getting tattoos is better than cutting my bf is 100% against tattoos so i havent gotten one yet and its embarrassing my scars from the pasti used to cut as it would drown out the pain iiwas feeling at the time,0
just be honest my husband has bipolar & paranoid schizophrenia as well as adhd i also suffer from severe anxiety we have always been 100% honest and upfront its a big key to building a solid foundation in a relationship if they truly love you they will be 100% supportive,1
the most important thing is to portray yourself on your worst day so if you cant walk at all on those days then tomorrow you dont walk the people who come out are nice and will help you you only need 12 out of 24 points to get full mobility component pip sounds scary for some but its actually more basic and for those who are disabled it will pay out,0
i was on effexor for 14 yrs but after having problems & having heart attack they took me off them changed to zoloft because effexor makes anxiety worse can give u high adrenaline outrages it makes ur heart rate go very fast also i had so much trouble comming off them bad experience but eveeyone is affected differently,1
it seams unless you you have depression or anxiety no one knows wot it is like on a daily basis,1
messing with bipolar medication is a very serious thing anxiety may be a symptom from the bipolar however no one should recommend anyone to get off medication that is not a doctor for some people its a crisis without their medication because its a legitimate chemical imbalance mental illness is not anything new gmo gluten etc chemicals this and that wasnt around in the bible days so please keep your natural remedies to yourself unless you went to medical school,1
coming from someone that was diagnosed at age 13 and have lived with my mental illness for the last 27 years for things to be easier take the time to learn your triggers and ques dealing qith bipolar or any mental illness is just the same as recovering from substance abuse or addiction i speak first-hand of this as my life was in turmoil for the better part of my life when you can spot your triggers and ques you can begin to circumvent and stop the issues from pulling you back into the depths i pray this helps you hi my name is rob i am a mental illness sufferer and drug addict,1
yes lets all stop taking our meds and instead go to whole foods smh it must be all that gluten that causes anxiety maybe gmos and high fructose corn syrup too!,1
im also a military wife my husband has been away 7 months of this year for work i suffer from ptsd depression sever anxiety and paranoia we had zero time to prepare found out a week before he had to leave it is really tough with a little one i temporarily "moved" to my parents for the time as i stay far and only have a small group of friends our military doesnt have a group for the wives so its tough good luck you can do this no matter who says what!,1
its just a new hairstyle called "manic panic" ive done it too i almost did it again last week,0
keep trying never give up i was at a point where i was so scared to leave the house i would only go to the mailbox and straight back in the house i had to change my meds about 30 times but i finally found a working combination i still get the anixety attacks but not every day,0
i was forced to take time off because of my anxiety ive always been a person that is determined to power through my anxiety no matter what but it got to a point where i couldnt even sit in a classroom without feeling like my throat was closing up the breaking point was one day when i got to class but absolutely could not go into the room i walked the hallway a few times trying to make myself go in and i just couldnt so i stopped going to that school and went to another where i could take online classes taking time off in order to better yourself is never a negative sit back and relax and go back to college when you can its better to take the time now then to convince yourself nothing is wrong and have the same things happen when you get into the workforce ive been through that too and im telling you its not fun best of luck were all here to support you <3,0
such a simple acknowledgement but so true you shouldnt be afraid to do things in life that benefit you first instead of others people need to make themselves first which the mentality of the suicidal person is that everyone is above them that needs to go!,0
this is all interesting i worked for years with people with mental health issues and realized i have them myself it really is easier to help other people than face those issues within ones self i took meds for bi polar got fat then stopped drank and got fatter stopped drinking as well i am into my 5th year now i started taking melatonin to sleep  high blood pressure pills and water pills now i have to work on my weight and get it back down the hard part is getting a mind set to set up a better routine  eat better and exercise morei know with the clients i used to work with keeping ongoing records was a valuable tool because you can see the results and work on routinepeople do much better with routines and organized homes clutter makes people nuts i know this because i lived with the people i worked with 7 days on 7 days off  i and my alternates worked well together keeping things organized and schedules everyone went to bed by 10 and up between 6 or 7 depending on client abilities,1
you can just take it an hour at a time then its not so overwhelming ,1
i have had nausea as a side effect for many meds but i have never acruelly thrown up from them you may feel uncomfortable but actually vomiting is pretty rare as far as i know your results may vary but after trying 20 or so different meds i never had one make me throw up good luck and i wish youthe best,1
everyday i am taking buspironeattivanviibridgabapentinrisperidone and trazodonei am suffering from extreme anxiety and fear of the unknown,1
my dvds have to be organized (if its a series they have to be in order) and straightened and all facing the same way if one gets disturbed it bugs me and i have to fix it i check the oven numerous times to make sure its off fold towels a certain way & make sure their straight when i hang a towel on a towel bar in the bathroom it gas to be straight and the tag cant be showing when i get ready to go out i have to get ready in order like brush my hair first put my contacts in brush teeth etc i cant touch things with my bare hands (that other ppl have touched & also i dont like shaking hands) i either have to use gloves or sanitizer i drive the same route to get to and from a familiar place i cant sit where someone has just sat; it feels too weird; i have to switch seats,0
it dosent matter what ppl say but if u have a mental illness your not going to believe positive things i would know im struggling with three mental illnesses so i know the struggle is real hope this makes sense,0
if you are at all wondering if you should go to the er you probably should its scary and ive done it i have bipolar ii as well and anxiety disorder ive been in behavioural units and youre right a lot of times its hard to even get in i hope you feel better i understand ask yourself if you feel safe if you dont go to the er theyve always treated me so well there,0
sometimes its a matter of pushing yourself i know part of me wants to go out and enjoy things but the other part says no i make a plan and prepare myself by putting a post it note on the fridge a to do in my phone and no matter how much i dont want to do it i make myself so i can tick it off my to do list small accomplishments really help depression and anxiety its all about pushing through its not easy but its worth it,0
i would add that there are things that might help some of you like: -holding an ice-pack to your face (a friend of mine tried this and was really surprised it calmed him down) -try 4/8 breathing (in through your nose for a count of 4 out through the mouth on a count of 8) which is really hard i know but if you succeed i think it is impossible to remain in a fight/flight mode humming might work for the same reasons since it is only possible to hum while breathing out -remind yourself that in a way you are causing this panic and so you can stop it you are in control (i do not me you do this actively like "oh lets have a panic attack" please do not get me wrong there),0
i understand how you are feeling! i think when you are on this path you have to try to find the good in every day even the smallest of things like a good cup of coffee some quiet reading time the birds singing some good calm music its easier said than done i know! but for me i had to get to a point where i had to take control i had to find someone to talk to and explain my feelings try to pin point what is triggering your anxiety is it social media is it the news is it the outside noise? i know its not easy im in a hard place as well right now but we have to try to keep moving forward surround ourselves with the things that make us happy or put our souls at ease,0
ive been on these meds (high dose) for 4 and a half years im trying to reduce it down for the 3rd time each time is horrid i know the good and bad of these meds and have had most of the bad side effects and bad withdrawl symtoms and im still scared to read this medications that work wonderfully for some people dont always work for others but if you dont try them out youll never know good luck and best wishes to anyone on serequel from the uk,0
i was on zoloft i was taken off of it i have ptsd bi polar severe anxiety severe depression i was put on seroqual lithium trazodon minipress cymbalta,1
my worst anxiety is at night it seems my mind races 1000mph and i cant make it stop i have tried every sleep med sedation drugs routines music and meditation i am sure this doesnt help much but i wanted to let u know you are not alone,1
may be time to move on not every partner can deal with it in a healthy manner had plenty of exes treat me like dirt thought i would make it up for attention etc found a guy who is patient and loving with me even when i snap or have an anxiety attack it takes a strong person,1
i use my alarm on my mobile the alarm doesnt turn off until i turn it off reminds me everyday,1
i just wanted to get my story out there i feel alone at times i got anxiety & depression i do take medicine for them but it doesnt always help ,0
all the time!!! and when you try to tell someone that they get scared and think youre thinking suicide but you just want a break from yourself and all the mental baggage,0
check your vitamin levels!! vitamin b12 turned my life around!! a deficiency in b12 can lead to depression and mania tablets are available but i get injections because some people dont absorb it properly vitamin d has greatly helped my irritability as well,1
mood stabilizers dont get rid of the anxiety or the pd so you dont feel fixed that waysome bipolar people have no comorbid anxiety or pd or trauma ptsd or ocd etc so mood stabilizers do make them feel "fixed" most of the time as for the rest we have something else going on most of the timeall the time,0
i understand i want to be normal so bad tired of the pills that dont work well tired of the being exhausted from the struggle of keeping my shit together see a dr if they help even a little its better than what you have now  good luck,0
it was so horrible it was good haha i watched it once and was like ok i watched it im done lol,0
becky bergmann voelker - i wish you and your daughter the best but please listen and understand when others tell you not to throw around "suicide is selfish" that statement is caused by ignorance often the person has the best of intentions and wants to help in any possible but until you are living years with a mental illness that you didnt ask for then and only then can you realize how deeply the mind is at war you can have the best support family friends and resources to help your suicidal thoughts but you are constantly fighting your mind feeling like you will be a burden if you do seek help selfish has nothing to do with it seeking help is a struggle and yes as you said everyone deserves help but for many it is not the clear cut choice it is not simple to choose help when your mind is telling you the world would be a better place without you please continue to become educated on mental health in order to stop from further spreading stigma most people i have talked to who have struggled with suicidal thoughts (myself included) think that if they do give into their thoughts then they will be doing others a favor it is a cruel battle between thoughts and actions,0
thats the only medication combo that has given me a reaction my doctor just prescribed me zoloft a few months ago i had just came off of lithium she literally said to me "oh zoloft is going to help with your anxiety but if youre bipolar your symptoms might get worse" & my anxiety was too bad to stay and try to find another medication i just went with it so i guess we are playing russian roulette with medication now ,1
i can see where this is coming from i was diagnosed with bipolar nearly 2 years ago after attempting suicide my mechanism to cope has always been food hence the size i am i find it very very hard to not eat junk food (to some people that may be confusing) even tho i have attempted to loose weight every single minute of my life im thinking about junk food so totally agree when it says it comes hand in hand with addiction,0
i take 200 mg i suffer with severe ocd and it has made my life so so much better it has also decreased my anxiety it changed my life!,1
i havent slept in three days i feel terrible sometimes i cannot feel anything i get numb without emotions other times i am sad and irritable my partner doesnt seem to understand or i dont know what i can say because we no longer communicate like we used to i feel like when i open up he feels tired of it or he feels helpless i dont know but im not feeling normal most of the time its exhausting ,0
i got bi polar 1 and it sucks  i also have ptsd bi polar 1 severe anxiety severe depression adhd suicidal ideation so its hard for me to explain sorry but people on here are doing a very good job of explaining it ,1
i went thru this with latuda holy heck it was awful!!! puking headaches vertigo itching paranoia crying spells god help us all,1
i always end up feeling like my partner has lost interest in me because they arent as sexual ive had an ex tell people that there was something wrong with me because of my sex drive its all quite upsetting the fact that hypersexuality is a part of me is hard to grasp even harder to know everyone doesnt think about sex as often as i do i have learned over the years to embrace it and but i still struggle good luck to you i hope you find some peace youre not alone,0
in general in bipolar you take a mood stabilizer like lithium or tegretol or lamictal or a few others ones then they tailor the other meds to where you are in a cycle and the anxiety that you are experiencing yes clonazepam is for anxiety but is addictive so be careful with it i just started buspar which seems to be helping my anxiety and is not addictive,1
yes i had sever post-partum depression after my second child it was the scariest thing i ever went through i did not have this when my daughter was born i have always had depression but when my son was born it was unbelievable i had thoughts of wanting to kill my own son! i wanted him to be another girl i knew that this was not me but i could not stop the thoughts from coming luckily we had a close friend that was a neurologist that told my husband to get me to the doctor right away it still took almost 8 months for me to recover on meds i could not remember how to write my own name if i showered i could not remember if i washed my hair or put on my conditioner please get to a psychiatrist and begin treatment for this right away it can get worse it is dangerous for you and your child or children feel free to message me if you need to talk dont wait to care for yourself you need to care for yourself first so that you can care for other s later,0
going on 67 years and still alive by grace of god its in remission mostly because of my age and help i got for myself earlier in life i live alone content peace and calmness still anxiety and other damages i can live with it now look at myself finally in the mirror that was hard for me for about forty years god be with all of you,0
i have a constant ringing in my right ear so and if its completely silent the ring is very loud and drives me crazy so i doubt this hypothesis,1
youll struggle n it will drive you crazy some times but if you keep it itll be the best thing uve ever had they will love you n you will love them but its up to you but stay strong n dont let anyone push you either way n as for the father if he doesnt want to help he doesnt know what his missing stay strong bub,0
thank you much i get paranoid easily and that helped immensely,1
i havent smoked in years and want the social engagement i just endlessly seem to find myself caught in this pattern of socialize/isolate and that leads tho mote negative thoughts and emotions and so on i can liken muy experience much like a corked bottle someone shook up in crowds im either going to " pop " and be delightful or im going to be a mess i just never know til in the moment which one im going to get,0
very effective with anxiety,1
depends on if the benefits outweigh the risks in my case they do,0
it most definitely is normal if you have medication to take it regularly as prescribed the fear should subside,1
i struggle too  and it has made it alot worse to fight the black dog they call depression and sadness as my mum the reason for my bieng  took her own life on the 10th march 2017 but she did raise us to be strong and that is what i am counting on  my strength ❤️,1
i was on it for a few months and noticed i started struggling to focus on simple tasks at work i felt like i could conquer the world but not plan how to do it i stopped and i began to be able to think clearly again i refuse to take it again no matter what,0
i understand more than you know i had a very similar youth but no meds my parents did not know better ilived in fear most of the time did my best it was not until 2005 when i had my first break down and was hospitalized i had many other things going on too all i can say is this do what you can when feeling good one day at a time give yourself permision to say no to people if not feeling up to it learn what joy is get the book one thousand gifts read it if you can it has helped have faith you can do it i do not know if you believe in god but he has helped me and i had been lost for many years with time inner peace you can and will become whole time is what we have remeber to breath when feeling overwhelmed people who understand will always be there because you are worthy of there love,0
my boyfriend is ptsd bi-polar or possibly bpd he wants to have sex sometimes as do i but we dont and have not for almost a year the reason is he is so mean and says such awful things or most every comment or reminder i make he takes as a personal assault this makes me withdrawal and afraid of him makes it very difficult to be intimate i love and care for him so very much but the hurt and anger he exudes is an instant and on going turn off it is hard to be open and vulnerable with someone who now blames you for all of his issues i try so hard,0
i think for me when i finally got my dx it took longer because i was flighty i would quit before they could tell me whats wrong because i didnt want to hear it and well mental illness doesnt exactly make consistency easy but i stuck with it a few years ago i had gotten out of a horrible abusive marriage i had 2 boys counting on me and i just knew i didnt want to be me anymore whatever that was or had been its taken a long time to get to where i am and im still a long way to where i need to go but i am further than ive ever been i dont regret waiting because everything happens for a reason and for whatever reason i wasnt ready and living in what-if will drive me mad(der) if i knew i was "so screwed up in the head" i would have never had kids i would have never lived any of the experiences i have the thought of not having my boys is beyond comprehension they are my salvation at times they are the one thing ive gotten right in life they are what gave me the strength to get out of an abusive marriage without them i wouldnt be here so an earlier dx would have prevented them from being born,0
i have very similar symptoms to yours and am also not sure if i am bipolar 2 my son was diagnosed but a psychiatrist told me i was a borderline case i am just utterly confused because the lows are so bad i just want die and then it gets better again till the next time i am not on any meds at the moment have been on so many different meds over the years and cant really say they made much difference,1
yet we feel guilty for what we are feeling,0
yep! my bf says he only gets 2 good weeks with me the other 2 weeks im an irritable angry bitch sometimes ,0
so i called the dr and he wantedto see measap nowwell now i am here and just overwhelmed whith anxiety and nervousness i havent slept in 2 days and im sorry shit just sux rightnow people thank you for letting me rant,0
agreed i took a similar couple of photos awhile back its scary how quickly my mind can shift,1
ive been on lamictal and never experienced side effects that extreme/terrifying you def need to get back in with your doc and possibly try another mood stabilizer,0

do you feel and internal restlessness as well? akathesia perhaps?,0
does dampen down my physical symptoms of anxiety especially rapid and pounding heart,1
this is exactly the double standard that is forced upon those with mental illness sure someone may have it worse however if the people who are "normal" would stop imposing their views on the mentally ill there would be more understanding for the mental illness and no criticism or its companion guilt,0
prayers for you i have have suffered from bipolaism anxiety terrible insomnia since i was 9 i was fairly popular in school i am overweight and have been since i was 13 so i got made fun of for years i hope your boyfriend will stand by you have you tried to get disability? i did and got it because of mental issues diabeyes heart condition and a wealth of other chronic things i did get an attorney they 25% one time fee go to ssagov and see about it do you have any family support?,0
actually i am as afraid of dying as i am of living fear keeps me in this life,0
i have been with a few men who couldnt handle it & it is literally awful when they dont understand or dont even try on one hand he seems to be trying but maybe needs to try to be a bit less blunt with how he says things to you as you are gonna take it to heart as all of us with any mental illness wear our heart on our sleeves i am now with someone who understands so much more & jesus it is different my sister is the one who worries about me with children but no matter how old how drugged up or how sad i am - life goes on & if i have a sad day its gonna happen no matter what the situation so we have to learn how to deal with it but that doesnt mean our mental health is gonna change i would say see how it goes with the councillor & if they cant make him understand more then im afraid he never will & maybe you need someone who will support you a bit more rather than telling you you will be a crap mum,0
hey i hear you! i suffer from bipolar& it sucks just hang in there it will get better i know it may be hard but just remember that there are people that do care dont be afraid to ask for help please talk to someone,1

zyprexa doesnt help me personally with sleep or anxiety i use ambien a few days then lunesta for sleep,1
i discovered remnants of food wrappers/containers next to my bed and that was my cue that i was going downstairs to the kitchen & eating while asleep on ambien i was nervous of going down the stairs when i was consciously awake so this really scared me! so i stopped using it for fear i might be one that would drive & not be aware! (i did feel rested after i awoke though!) tried taking belsomra and although i didnt have same side-effect it wired me up so bad my eyes wouldnt even stay closed! now i am back to taking xanax (05mg) when i cannot sleep,1
normal people cant comprehend how a seemingly happy person is a threat to themselves the isolation caused by fear of misunderstanding is deadly,0
what is your dosage on your zoloft ive been on it since 1992 started at 25 now up too 150mg i also take zanex and colozopan for anxiety,1
and the person who said rip i found that rude julie is still alive and i have hope in her that she will be alive tomorrow and so on dont say rip scare her why dont you julie sweetheart i send you the biggest warmest hugs ill be thinking of you and keep posting on here ok xx,0
i found counselling a god send and a relief just keep telling yourself this is a good thing if you do have a panic attack they will be able to talk you through it which will be helpful for the next panic attack,0
you might want to ask your doctor about being bipolar you sound manic with anxiety to me im not a doctor but i have bipolar do you have reckless behavior the shopping thing we know do you have mood swings being low and depressed not wanting to get out of bed do you go into an extreme high on life like you can do anything? these are all traits of bipolar i have bipolar 2 with depression anxiety ptsd from abuse as a child please make an urgent appt with your doctor also keep a thought journal account for your spending any racing thoughts sleepless nights and eating take to your dr there is a questionnaire on bipolar disorder they can give you,1
i have not been on medication for several years now i was not able to find one that really worked for me i started eating differently and exercising i started making time in the sun (just 15/20 minutes) a day a priority its hard to do that in the winter here however i do what i can i do still have severe lows i wont lie and say its easy it is just working for me i hope that everyone is able to find something that works for them be that medicine or not so much love to all who are struggling!!,1
yes i agree its scary that we could have such intense and morbidly dark thoughts in our minds but i deal with these thoughts daily  its a struggle,0
us with bpd put more pressure on ourselves bc we think more and stress more than normal ppl do im on seroquel and citalopram it works great for me i get a long nights rest it will help you,1
stay with this group and talk to us!!! we have been there and we are all here to be strong together!!! worry about getting you feeling better first then worry about a friend!! because thats about all you will have once the fun is over hang in there and know you are not alone!!!!,0
he needs to see both a psychiatrist and a therapist he should be doing cognitive behavioral therapy with the therapist the most likely drug that would help him is effexor which treats both depression and anxiety,1
i know what your saying i live with unreality of life and i live for my husband and kidswhen life gets hard talking to someone can dilute your feelings i think a therapist or someone who will let you just release your feelings your drowning in can help but when your down you dont see any other way but if your living for ppl then theres a reason to stay strong i do it so my kids dont come to a place where i am even tho life can be so bloody hard you need to give yourself time and maybe seek medication just to take the edge off i hope this has helped and that you find your way through what can be a horrible thing to live with take care x,0
my psychiatrist prescribed trazadone its in the anti anxiety family it does not help me sleep but i take it and go to bed and what i do sleep is restful peaceful it helps my mind relax,1
go back and prove her and everyone else who doubts you wrong! dont quit on something you want to do you are not a failure,0
i just love when people say you have to be strongum let me see you live with this illness work raise kids alone deal with everyday life struggles cry your eyes out almost on a daily endure tremendous emotional pain that gets so bad it becomes physicaland still smile never tell a survivor of mental illness they need to be strongonly the strong can keep going and never give up no matter how much theyve gone through people live their lives trying to avoid feeling uncomfortable or only understand grieving when they lose a loved one or get divorced or any life tragedy people with mental illness get to know what that pain feels like alreadyand we still are trying to survive warriors is what we areand to be a warrior and survive this illness takes more strength than most can even wrap their mind around,0
i do not have bpd (i was diagnosed bipolar 2 with many many other things) but i have a partner who may have it (though he lives somewhere currently where they have a horrible mental health system as are really bad at diagnosing so we arent positive) there are some types of meds that help mood stabilizers are supposedly the select few that can cause some relief with bpd but i definitely recommend dbt and therapy if you dont already but until you can do it there are a lot of things you can do for yourself for now find things that help you obsess in a positive way i also write but i write not only about what i feel but in my novels(which helps be obsess productively) i also have my animals which need constant care every day and i rehab a lot of animals so that helps a lot with giving me something i am constantly researching about them because i enjoy it there are many other things you can do just for every day stuff walking or just any exercise yoga has been an extreme help for me just finding what works for you is really really important ^^,1
im diagnosised bipolar 1 anxiety depression and ptsd in the area where i live nami has support groups every night of the week i have met people that share my diagnoses or if they dont they still understand what im going thru its been a huge help for me especially since i didnt have any support or people that understood,0
these feelings you are having i think are all due to your anxietybecause as i told youthat is just how i felt when i had those anxiety attacksyou must tell your doctoryou may need some tranquelisers to calm you downxxx,1
anxiety can cause intrusive thoughts things you would never actually do or that dont make sense they are vivid and can be very scary but they are the result of the chemicals in your brain working differently your therapist should be someone you trust if you cant trust him or her then find a new one good luck!,1
it took me awhile before i met people that i trusted with some of the horrible abusive stuff ive dealt with my main issue is i dont like being looked at with pity when i need support youve taken the first step by mentioning some things here over time i find it becomes easier ive forgiven those who hurt me realized it made me who i am i still deal with feelings of self hate but talking about some of what happened to people that are struggling like yourself is easier we are all hurting in some way the best way to move forward is let it go by crying writing about it typing it in groups like this its not a sign of shame or weakness but strength,0
i take neulactil there only 25 mg but 2 of them with valium seem to help me go to sleep they calm the body down from anxiety & help you sleep better,1
hydroxyzine works great for my panic attacks and calms down my anxiety,1

i take 600mg lithium 150mg lamotrigine which is fairly new also 175mg quitiapine 10 - 15 mg diazepam and 7mg zoplicone a sleeping tablet i take them all at night and when i take them i almost instantly feel soo dizzy and if i dont lie down immediately im staggering about the place yet im having real difficulty sleeping i think its got something to do with lamotrigine but since my psychiatrist left after 9 years all i get is locums and they dont seem to listen and just up lamotrigine and quitiapine i dont think im on the right meds but they dont really listen and im scared to rock the boat incase they give me something that will increase my weight so im in a catch 22 as ive not been in hospitalfor two years and dont want to go back but my mood is more down than up x,0
hydroxyine (vistaril) is an antihistamine used to treat allergic reactions nausea sickness and tension and anxiety as it has sedative effect seroquel is an anti psychotic not an anti depressant and normally prescribed in addition to an anti depressant if person is suffering depression,1
very truei fight my depression everydaysomedays i win and some days it winsmy doc has cut down my anxiety and depression meds really????,1
secondly meds only do half the work  you need tools to deal with you anxiety cbt is very good,1
speak to him honestly and openly tell him your fears regarding his lies you never know unless you try he may be going through something too but might not think youre strong enough for him to tell you? besides all of that you need to focus on getting yourself better if something he is doing is hindering that you have to talk to him and then work out where you two go from there,0
im fine hun honest dont worry babes xx,0
try a dosette box you fill it once a week and put it somewhere you will see it try it with an alarm on your phone to remind you,1
deb knapp i have been in that state of mind and it is selfish one who commits suicide may be ending their life and their misery but they are hurting so many people who would have done anything to help if they had only known i was a selfish person but someone said something that struck a nerve for me n snapped me out of it and i got help n i knew that no matter how hopeless life seems some days there is a light at the end of the tunnel and things get better!!! just takes time we r all strong n we can all conquer anything some just need a little help!!!!,0
ive only been taking wellbutrin for about 6 months but im like a new person however it does not help with anxiety which im still struggling with but it has helped with my depression tremendously i actually lost some weight when i started it and im not as hungry all the time so its helped in a lot of ways its something i would most definitely recommend to anyone,0
i was scared of taking meds too but then as a last resort i did and they saved my life just know you are not alone in your feelings,0
hyper-mania would be referred to as just mania mania is considered worse than hypomania as the severity of paranoid delusions hallucinations etc are much worse in my personal opinion that are both just as bad hypomania is consistent with bp2 which is harder to diagnose as the milder symptoms get dismissed or overlooked,0
happens to me lots days when i cant function or go out the door and many pyjama days that sometimes make me feel guilty but it is what it is and i think because ive not been able to work for a really long time ive got no friends and cant make myself find new ones because im not reliable because of a weather phobia so i can only go out spur of the moment which is difficult and hard to have friends when you cant plan ,0
first stop being ashamed would you feel shame if you had cancer? when people say something like that just know they are saying the weather is having mood swings wet dry cold hotits not actually directed or meant as anything i have lived with this for 45 years and ive learned it is part of who i am and i feel no shame but not from lack of trying to shame me from my mom its just who i am and i have enough triggers without letting ignorance of someone else be another next time someone says something is "bipolar" respond with poor weather poor wash machine you have no idea what they are going through and laugh it off dont be ashamed of the illness it makes us very special we are talented artistic and all around extremely intelligent people thats nothing to be ashamed of,0
yes its my anxiety,1
i do the same with art supplies i have so many sketch books pencils markersyou name it i have it it makes me feel so good to get these thing but then i crash later when i have trouble using them or cant find inspiration right away youre not alone i almost had a panic attack at the grocery store tonight just because i know my money was really limited but i needed food i was lucky my mom was with me because when i got in the car she distracted me with chit chat and i calmed down anxiety is a booger but you are hear and you are alive and youre sharing with us good luck with the trial will be thinking about you,0
its such a struggle every day i take it minute by minute even reached out to this page for help i need so desperately and no-one responded hope that doesnt happen to other people that cry out it makes me feel alone all i do is pray god does answers prayers sometimes straight away sometimes in his time i just want all to know that you are not alone!!,0
yes it sucks pun intended its hard to take its humbling to be dependent and its a pain to remember and its scary to fear running out and on top of all that its expensive but medication keeps me stable and i feel that its worth it in the long run untreated my bipolar disorder made my life chaotic and unproductive not to mention terribly painful being sane is priceless and i try to be thankful that there is a treatment for my condition,1
focus on somethinganythingbreathe pray make sure psych knows its emergency you be seen if you cant wait until then you get dressed and you self talk yourself into going to er you will be ok i know i also have to do a lot of self assuring that i can go places its not easy there comes a time where you have to do things that sure uncomfortable you can do it!,0
hi liz i so hear you about being tired of going back and forth to the doc and playing the trail and error game as hard as it may be to play that game unfortunately its about the only way they can find the right combination for you and your body type each one of us is different in how our bodies will react so its hard to say what will work for you it can take a long time to find the right combination but its not just about the meds please as anne stated work at finding a team that can help you this includes a psychiatrist your family doc and a therapist and other supports as well you talk about the nightmares and night tremors this is something that you can work with a trained prefessional on with cbt or other forms of therapy that work for you (again sometimes trail and error but worth it) in my opinion and experience it was only when i had a therapist that i trusted and could really open up to and be able to talk about the reasons for my ptsd that i was able to slowly get the nightmares terrors and body memories to get less frequent hang in there and continue to work with your team to find the best treatment for you,1
 how we feel is connected to what we think what we think is connected to what we believe what we believe is connected to god only knows these days this depends on what we were taught and who taught us happiness is a state of mind that can only exist in the present moment a bad day after bad day makes a bad week a bad month a bad year bad year after bad year makes a bad life all the fault of how we think each moment of everyday our thought habits control our present moment learning to control the way we think controls the way we feel this book contains a sure fire method that will allow us all to understand and control what we think; which allows us to finally be in control of how we feel this book will help all people to understand their emotional motivation but will be especially helpful to those who suffer chronically from anxiety depression ptsd and bipolar disorder the information contained in this book has changed my life from a 36 year intense emotional roller coaster ride into a path of daily peace calm stability and progress i prayed to the universal wisdom (our creator aka god) to take me out or show me the way preferably to show me the way but i really had my doubts back then i asked for the answer i asked for the key to turn my life around i promised i would share this answer with all who suffer like i suffered; if my answers were made clear to me my wish was granted writing this book allows me to keep that promise i cant wait until you are able feel the same ways too as i am able to feel today our past does not have to equate our future change is indeed possible and much closer than we may think i stand by this book i am proud of the information contained within; it has allowed me to finally begin to enjoy each moment of everyday; instead of just reacting to it and hoping happiness shows up someday i know our emotions can make us needy and very impatient so this book is intentionally designed to be succinct to the point and as quick of a read as possible yes yes indeed we can all learn how to start feeling better,0
yes! i am almost 3 weeks sober (again) technically ive been diagnosed with bipolar and general anxiety i had horrible pms theyve had me on different cocktails of about 12 mental health drugs at the same time i stopped drinking a couple weeks ago i stopped all my meds except 20 mg celexa (i was on 40) and xanax as needed im trying to see what happens without all the drugs i felt mood stabilizers made me worse and i feel alcohol is my worst trigger good luck!!,1
i take buspar for gad lithium for mania and latuda for depression this is the right combo for me i feel amazing finally after 18 years i found the correct combination i have bipolar 1 gad and social anxiety disorder,1
i am dreading going to the psychiatrist gonna cost me big bucks,0
im severe bipolar every damn day is a struggle i dont do meds hate the way they messed with all of my health and created more issues i absolutely force myself to get up go to work and take care of my kids ive learned to hide my depression and anxiety ridiculously well my wife pretty much never notices my struggle my ex husband however used to tell me to "take another pill" "youre weak" etc my mental illness is a huge part of me but it doesnt shape who i am im opposite of most on this post and my advice is to push yourself every single day even if you just get up and shower you at least conquered one battle one battle at a time each day and congratulate yourself on each step in the end you are the only one that will change you support you and stand by you maybe hes not the right guy you have to learn to love you and embrace all of you before you worry about his acceptance,0
that is so wrong i only struggle with depression and anxiety so i dont know what its like but i do know that its not how u treat some one im sorry u had to deal with that,0
i go through this when im in mania its insatiable when im not in mania i dont want to be touched one extreme to the other the abuse part is most likely a fetish some people desire it nothing to be ashamed of this is an open group so i feel anything can be discussed and you should expect triggers whats the point of the page if you cant talk about the problems defeats the purpose pay no mind to anyone judging you we get that enough from society and shouldnt have to worry about it here good luck!,0
i take both propanolol and lamictal and my doc and i are leaning towards a bipolar 2 diagnosis the propanolol is essential for me for an internal tremble and keeps my blood pressure in mind the biggest side effect ive noticed is my physical stamina is effected less endurance out of breath more easily the lamictal for mood stabilization for had not shown any side effects and ive avoided the constant up and down moods since starting it a few weeks ago for me the combination is essential and effective with little side effects,1
read the last thing you wrote? your kids you had a really tough life and i see where that has had a huge impact  i had a shitty childhood too such traumas can cause us go through life with negative self talk and fear mindfulness is very helpful,0
true must say as someone struggling with mental illness i do display thez when triggered,0
you need to tell your dr your fears they need to know and they can then help you be prepared to trial different meds it took me around 18 mths before i found the right combo,1
i take 10 mg of propranolol 3x daily to keep my anxiety at bay it doesnt make me drowsy or loopy or anything i have xanax for really bad days or days when i have to leave the house,0
yes i see a psychiatrist and counselor but i still struggle,0
having a good well respected gp is key to getting on disability theres always a medication that can help so dont give up trying even though it can take a while to find the right combo marijuana is good for everything but i cant get it for ptsd an alpha blocker like prazosin helps with nightmares not many gps know this a betta blocker like propranolol is good if you have panic attacks shakes or heart pulpitations other than that anti depressants and a mild antipsychotic does help with anxiety and sleep,1
i need this right now my fincee left me on friday to go back home  been together for 16 years  my ptsd bi polar anxiety n depression is very high  i dont have a clue on what im doing half the time  i hate feeling so confused n worthless all the time  all i do all day is think about her and worry about her ,0

eletric shock therapy it used to be popular till we finally got some effective drugs you lose some of your memory when they do it i talked to patients who underwent it when i was considering it i decided the risk was too great instead i flew from wa to ca to enter a hospital just for mental health there are a ton of facilities for alcoholics and drug abusers and not enough for mental health,1
i suffer from bipolar and anxiety and i take lithium and quetiapine plus diazapam,1

i can really understand and feel the way its a daily struggle! you just wrote everything i go thru n feel! i have anxiety ptsd bpo i self harm alot more then ever now cuz all i hear is how im not good enough and i cant do anything right!,0
regardless of whether a side effect is normal or not unless your doctor told you it would happen and dont worry about it you should call him/her and let them know they cant help you if they dont know what is happening especially true when trying to find the right meds make sure you let them know you are still taking your meds but u wanted them to know how you are reacting to them,0
please see your gp as this will not go away without the help of meds and some techniques with your anxiety dont suffer in silence as the help is out there good luck!!,1
its actually like you want to do something anything just to get you out of that dark depressed feelings but you are too anxious to do anything! even if you make some plans you cancel them because you get too anxious and if god forbids if you have social anxiety like me too! i love meeting and talking to people it helps me to feel less depressed and more alive but it like my mind is on constant stress making duty!,0
celixia never worked for me its one of the first meds they put me on but i have severe panic attacks doc calls it high functioning axiety along with bipolar and complex ptsd with ocd and insomnia,1
prayer about how you are feeling really helped me and reading the bible psalms are good to read through lifes ups and deep downs david went through horrible traumas and he kept on believing and praying to and trusting in god it helps us to do so too the gospels especially the book of john is really gods love letter to us sent through jesus,0

schizophrenia displays symptoms of depression as well as psychosis (audio hallucination is common) and may explain the obsessive thoughts and impulsive behaviour; mdd has a psychotic symptoms allowance but you dont tend to come across psychotic mdd patients that hallucinate; bipolar (type 2 i believe) would explain the depression impulsive symptoms and the psychosis;,1
agree listen to doc but it was hell for me too if youve ever seen trainspotting kind of like that brain zaps nausea migraines on and on horrible i tapered slowly under docs supervision and still hell,0
christopher l snead its true and before i had any issues with mental health i never got angry or agitated so this is so out of character it scares me so much when it happens ya know?,0
i have both and its horrible,0
set an alarm on your phone i have that plus i keep my meds in a dosett box beside my bed so i take them just after breakfast when i get ready in the morning and just before going to bed at night but the alarm is key it takes 21 days to build a new habit taking ng tablets is a habit we all need to get into,1
talk to your kid do they know if his parents are supportuve types and hes hust afraid they wont accept him for being gay? or are they assholes? if he isnt already being ostracized by hus parents for everything go to them dont say anything about gay but let them know you are concerned about his cutting,0
and incredibly paranoid ocd aggressive irritable unreliable hypersexual suicidal,0
some of you are giving terrible advice i myself have depression anxiety and bipolar so i understand that what he said hurts but at the same time someone without these or similar illnesses has no clue what it feels like to live with them everyday hes right you need to be a strong woman to raise children but hes also trying to understand and continue the relationship despite the mental illnesses seeing a counselor is a great idea to help both of you understand each others concerns and positions work with him and see where things go,1
i struggle with depression alot if you need someone to talk or anyone does dont hesitate to message me im usually up late so even if its late shoot me a message ,0
even after years of dealing with depression most the time i dont realize my sleeping habits are an indication of depression i dont purposely do it i just end up sleeping --- a lot for example i thought i was over my recent bout and now ive done nothing but sleep for 3 days in a row honestly when i go through these phases for a week or so i just tell myself "im catching up in sleep" the good thing is its better then the flat out misery of staying awake through it during the day and dealing with it id much rather deal with this sort of depression at least i dont have to deal with any issues for a few days - a week u like most people my cycles are so insane i still dont recognize where im at most the time as i just try to discount my symptoms which i have gotten much better at the bad side is i get to where i tell myself i can go back to work for a few days a month make plans to do so then this shit starts back up unlike most people im the opposite summer months are worse for me then winter months still rapid cycle through both but more ups then down winter months glad these posts show up on my timeline i dont respond often but it seems helpful ones show up at least once a month ,0
was taking a high dose & had night terrors & sweats for 6 months (worst 6 mths of my life!) & my psychiatrist said it wasnt lamical but against his opinion i decreased by 50mg & its fine,1

this is what my friend once said he is first one to tell me about adhd talking about my anxiety nature - while taken as a gift it feels better i also like that metaphor canary on the coal mine in any case there is uplifting purpose why i am this way <3 worth keeping going,0
i know exactly how you feel i was diagnosed with bipolar 10 years ago but suffered from depression/anxiety for years before that im also very lonely as when you cant work for more years than you care to remember the friends you thought would always stand by you move on and dont care about you anymore i understand to a certain extent but surely the odd phone call wouldnt hurt but know i consider myself to be a decent caring person and would never do that to them just a phone call but i dont even know a few of there numbers and they dont seem to want to give me them even if ive asked on xmas cards im not out to ruin there lives and i know i should move on but its a lonely life when for a while ive been in and out of the local psychiatric hospital maybe they dont want to be associated with mental health but maybe one day you just dont know it could happen to them i think ive made friends from hospital but they dont keep in touch either i know they are ill too but if youre kind hearted ive been taken for a mug quite a few times eg lending money you never get back having jewellery stolen and trusting an alcoholic who charmed me to the tune £4000 yes i got to like him even although im a married woman but my husband is not cuddly or complementary and this guy knew how to get me to furnish his house buy clothes cigarettes and even a washing machine there was no sexual relationship but if hed wanted to i think id have been up for it and i know that seems terrible as ive been married for 34 years but we were going through a bad patch eventually he didnt get in touch and like a little boy was scared he had a girl friend what i hated most was the way he lied to me texting me saying we must go out for dinner me paying of course when he had no intention of meeting me i was really hurt and even now my marriage isnt a bed of roses as he lost his job and 8 months later is still looking so you can imagine the atmosphere in the house also we dont have much in common apart from 2 lovely children there is hardly any conversation now i know a lot of you would say split up and many times i want to but ive never lived on my own ever and dont think iam strong enough to go through with it not sure what will happen but just have to put up with it for now sorry for the rant but apart from the samaritans this helps me get it out of my system for a little while x,0
i too needed larger doses of ativan but would forget entire days so i flushed them it was scary!,0
manic panic schizophrenic ,0
i take klonopin for anxiety however i take a higher dose than most although my dr keeps close tabs because it can be addictive i also take lithium lamictal seroquel and vraylar for the bipolar rapid cycling,1
honestly i think your approach would depend on what things he is/isnt doing is it lack of self care lack of motivation to go to work? deciding to stop taking meds without speaking to his dr? or self destructive behaviors such as binge drinking gambling before paying bills drug use or self harm? is it a pattern he falls into during his depressive cycle or is this a new development? im sorry to ask such personal questions but my advice would differ based on what is going on and how seriously it could impact his life and/or health both immediately and long term sorry if thats no help but if you want to message me privately youre welcome to sometimes we need support and understanding and sometimes we need someone who cares enough to push us out of our comfort zone of misery and help us get the medical help we need i have multiple diagnosis including bpd my husband has been amazing through it all once he learned what was actually going on with me(he was great before but understanding went a long way to open up communication so i could tell him what i needed and not feel judged/guilty/ashamed),0
jocelyn bryn also good advice "oh shift" is a book that ive read shift your way of thinking im no reader at all but have anxiety depression & stress this book was a good read,0
i was taking the 150 but they put me on the 300 and ive been having to break them up ive been noticing at night some leg restlessness with this dose so im hoping i can switch back once my medicaid goes through to the pharmacy cause i didnt experience it till i got those :/,0
hang in there the trials of attempting to find the right medications is a long and annoying but once your doctor and you have found the right combination its worth it i have been seeking for over a year and only now am i getting close but it was worth the struggle,1
i dont have any works perfect for me never fort i be me again and yea im back as me but i dose put on weight but dont let that scare u,0
i dont know if it will help but i can promise you that even if you cant feel it or him there is a god and he knows who you are and loves you for exactly who you are i would also recommend finding a good therapist and a psychiatrist but i also want you to know you are loved and valuable i dont know you personally but i know you are a precious son of god that christ has experienced all the pains and fears that you have felt i have a difficult time accepting christs love for me but its easy for me to know and bear witness of his love for others never never never give up!!!,0
how amazing are you full credit to you you have done so well people who struggle with this illness will gain hope from this post i myself have a relatively normal life but im quite heavily medicated ive been in my job for 18 years and yes ive had small glitches but all in all ive done very well well done to you to be able to deal with your illness without meds long may it continue ,0
yeah nexplanon like depo have the same hormones and they have no estrogen so they shouldnt have many side effects i think the only side effect for me was lack of sex drive it didnt bother my depression or anxiety at all,1
thank you guys i am just so frustrated i just want to be fixed ive been having way more bad days then good i have been diagnosed with major depression generalized anxiety and borderline personality disorder i take my medicine like im suppose to and its not helping,1
i was in one about two months ago its not as scary as you would think there are usually some very nice ppl in there and the staff wont let you come to any harm just try youre best and tell them whats going on in your life and they will help you they are there to help you its not a nice place but i definitely needed to be in there at the time as i wasnt safe because i tried to kill myself four times in a short time there is help afterwards too so pls just take the help x,0
i must say i am controlled bipolar but i always have my ups and down still and yes i love the happy part but theres things that make you happy when your stable and not necessarily the mental part of it just try not to dread that youre going to come down eventually and be prepared for it,0
mine get bad sometimes music will pull me out or being busy with a focused activity that i enjoy like baking or coloring i use the calm app and do a meditation if theyre racing and im anxious or trying to sleep sometimes i have to get my meds bumped up they just wont stop until i do it has lasted weeks before good luck,1

i am one of those battling with anxiety disorder but i am coping because i am aware now,1
my mania is not enjoyable its anger irritability a nd feeling like im just gonna completely go over the edge! its so horrible any body else experienced this?,0
its so so hard it is also hard to advise or even suggest what worked for others as your individual case is just that i just know that when you are feeling as bad as you obviously are and cant see the wood for the trees it is so difficult to know what to do for the best for my recovery the first major step was acceptance and i suspect you are at that stage where you are fully aware of your illness and are not pretending to yourself or others the next step is taking responsibility for yourself and your recovery which you are now trying to do these are major steps which you should feel proud of and are far from easy to embrace and admit many live with mental illness in relative secrecy so if you do have people who care and you care about it must help but it must be so tough for those around you but im sure they will do all they can however hard it is at the end of the day you all want the same thing to get you well i felt i wanted to escape i think thats quite common not not to be here but to escape from the torment and pain to escape that torment the answer is to get better there is hope which you must hold on to i had months day after day on the sofa today i can enjoy the tiny things there is hope unfortunately it isnt easy to recover its a long hard road but ultimately i think we all have the strength i had to do it alone no one knew or if they did they didnt care enough i was adamant i wouldnt take anti depressants see a counsellor or take sleeping tablets i was frightened and not in control in the end i took the lot recovery from mental depression is often a huge mixture of small steps whatever works best for you if you have loved ones lean on them let them help its down to small steps achievable goals when you are ready try to come up with a plan small but significant steps to move forward and get you better try to pinpoint what isnt working what you need to change take each day as it comes be kind to yourself people need you and love you you can do this for them but mainly for you there is light there is colour there is hope xxx,0
one thing that people forgot to mention is god its not about being religious but about being spiritual and that means believing in something positive and good there​ had to had been something that triggered those feelings of depression back and its hard to distinguish what it was i personally feel get those horrible feelings all of a sudden that i immediately react in a way that is unforgivable to my loved ones i beg god to make me a different and better normal human being because i dont even like myself(my outbursts) and its been months since ive taken my meds and i thought that i would of already been in the mental ward by now but thank god that he has allowed me to still be here with my family doing the best that i can to manage it so what ive also done was i begged my husband to educate himself on bipolar and all the rest of the disorder does to a person so that he could learn how to cope and so he could help me manage it because all the medicine ive been taking all these years were only numbing me and im pretty sure not helping my liver nor kidneys basically what im saying is that in order for me to cope with it i need faith in god (ny higher power)the support of my family (them learn about the disorder) so it could show them how to help me manage it and of course for them to also cope in a positive way because if not they would had already left me and i would not know what to do with myself ive been learning something new every day and it doesnt matter how old or young its always good to educate ourselves on any kind of disorder disease or addiction for the sake of the ones we love positive support from family & friends asking for help learning technics on how to control the situations  thoughts that trigger our bipolar mood swings ect and keeping ourselves active to improve our health helps control /manage or not think about those horrible negative feelings from getting worse and so forth but eventually i believe if we follow some of the good positive advise given will do us bipolar people some time and u will see some improvement and it does take time  and the surroundings have a lot to do with it,0
firstly why did you stop? you also dont say what meds you were taking its not a good idea to just suddenly stop some meds have dreadful withdrawal symptoms and you really should gradual dose reduction over a few weeks,1
i didnt get any sleep just lost big chunks of time id been afraid of it because my ex always told me it made her have "demonic" dreams i had no such problem just no sleep,0

one thing to remember is that youre not lazy when i got to a point where i just couldnt do simple tasks anymore i called myself lazy and just felt worse and worse about myself only when i found the right meds (or the right meds for now) did i realize how much better and how much different i felt i realized that i hadnt been lazy and that it was the illness attacking me with all it had i realized that there was a difference between being sick (with the flu etc) and having a horrible day with depression when youre sick you can get out of bed and take care of yourself when youre in a low sometimes you cant do those things and thats okay youre alive and youre fighting to win so always think more of yourself then the voices in your head say you are not lazy,0
so the cool thing is that you can listen to the birds in the morning without rushing off to work im afraid thats all i got for positive anything,0

i hate having both anxiety is a constant for me and it always has been depression comes and goes but when i have them both at the same time i feel like a walking contradiction desperate for connection yet i want to be alone and not talk to anyone my body is tired but my mid is tangled with everything that i didnt do and how badly i might have messed up what i did do having both is truly what nightmares are made of i have pushed so many people away over time i go from one extreme to another one minute im crying the next i want to rip peoples heads off i just dont know what to do next,0
yea my father was in the same situation and nobody had the courtesy to inform me of anything even when i called them! my calls were blockedtold sos: same old shit put downverbally assaulted and threatened more than once not to visit or call or even to show up idk what i did or why i am treated this way (besides having a mental illness and dehumanization societal norms are changing for the worse weddings graduations baby announcementsall computer generated the downward spiral of good manners and social interaction count me out,0
i was diagnosed with bipolar 15 years ago at that time i had become very poorly and tried to kill myself luckily my doctor has been fantastic and spent alot of time getting my meds right i refused to be admitted to mental health hospital went every week to a special clinic with other outpatients my doctor didnt think i would ever hold down a full time job but i can say with much pride that i managed to hold down my job for the last 13 years look after my family and now my grandchildren one of which i have special guardian ship of every day is a struggle but i have been blessed with a wonderful family and some really lovely friends when i feel an episode coming on i go straight to my doctor if it is bad but i have come to recognise triggers and my husband children and parents also can tell when something is wrong i wont let the big black nothing get me so poorly again please if you think there is something wrong dont be scared or embarrassed it isnt a bad thing to need help be happy it is your right!!!! ,0
you shouldnt be just go and have it in mind that god is with you he says we should fear not cause hes with us,0
i have been in your boat with family just cut them out your life if they bring you down you have less stress its not easy when ppl feel like they cant go on anymore you need to feel safe and secure warm and wrapped up cry until you have no more tears left and the rest watch something that makes you feel relaxed because at the moment your not with a clear head your with a sad and down head on please try what i have said distract your mind and see tomorrow is another day we need to take little steps in our situation i hope this has helped even a little your not alone even tho you feel you are take care x,0
i have a success story i have agoraphobia bipolar gad and panic attacks i used a company called ssdc services (you can google them) who did all the paperwork over the phone and mail i was approved my first time after only four months i suggest you call this group and see what they can do for you good luck!,1
with anxiety medications and antidepressants make you gain weight now there is a solution for that if you get on thyroid meds to help that will work also i know its hard but change what you are eating like put fruits and veggies in the house and if you crave something create something good with the fruits and veggies if you go off your medication you will experience hell  you will have ups and downs and you will eat bc you are depressed all the time you will have withdrawal symptoms and that is hard to stop you will make yourself worse stopping it i am bipolar and i really dont suggest to stop taking your meds there are some really bad side effects from it i would lower your dose on the lithium and stay on the other i dont want to sound rude but the last thing you should do is stop your medication i have seen what happens and i know you will not like it for example my dad is bipolar and my mom comes from work when i was a baby and she saw my crib broken into pieces with me still in the bed he was off his medications for several days now when i ran out of my anxiety meds for 5 days my jaw locked up and all i could do is shake and cry bc i couldnt talk my jaw was pretty much stuck i have tmj and it flared so bad that we had to force my pharmacist to fill it there are not any methods you can do if you stop your medication i would just be careful and you may be on a high thinking it is ok to stop a lot of ppl feel that way you are not alone stay safe and good luck!,1
ive been smoke marijuana most of my adult life and it helps me better than any pill ive tried everyone is different and some say it makes them paranoid so cbd oil might be a better place to start than just smoking the flower depending on how it may effect you,1
yes i co-sign this when you have extreme stress you may need a medication change or some type of adjustment sending you lots of love and light,1
ugh i once stopped taking my meds cold turkey for a few months i got a severe depression and i even felt suicidal so scary! im back on my meds and im staying on them,1
ebbie casey my daughter gets so triggered when she goes out her thinking about others gets so mixed up she imagines people are looking at her talking about her etc she imagines that people are other people or that she sees people from her past the stress of going out alone really triggers her she cant be on more meds does anyone have a strategy for getting more comfortable with going out on your own to diminish these reactions?,0
self harm addict for over 15 years its tricky becuase you cant talk with others in fear of triggering them i found rather then trying to stop how can i regulate and get to sobriety i am at the point where i go years apart and it took a long time but anyone can get there youve probably heard this a lot but dbt is ur best bet to learn to live with it you have to want to own it and cope otherwise it doesnt work my biggest helper was a mental health box i put chocalate photos red washable marker scented candle and lotionectitems to help you cope and ground yourslef if you can touch ground you can usually get urslef threw next craving coping mechanisms are learned then you have to use them i used think they were silly try this and dont work then not for you freeze a bunch of red koolaid ice cubes or if u got it fake blood when i would get a craving i would push the ice hard against my skin where i hurt and it melt looking like bleeding the ice is so cold you even get numb sensation where you push also can try drawing red lines then do the red ice you get more effect afterwards id clean up and put kid bandaids all over where i did itworked for me cant hurt to try no pun intended,1
what should i do i feel like there is nothing that would make me happy anymore i dont care about anything anymore nothing excites me i have no motivation the only reason i dont sleep all my life is because i have uncomfortable pillows which i am afraid to change them with comfortable ones i feel so drained and emptyplease anybody tell me something a new perspective a reason to live to breath! i want to cry but i cont even see point in doing that,0
hey there accept the help of family and friends they love you find out from your doctor about finding a support program for women in your situation be vocal about any scary thoughts that come up the baby growing inside of you is a blessing,0
yesim going through a horrible down time that has been lasting almost a year now i feel there not a single person who truly understands what im going through even the ones who say they do underatand i feel like im drowningive been having horrible thoughts of suicide and its so hard to not think so negativelyi just dont know what to do or where to start,0
dont worry about them some people you can never please focus on you!❤,0
also your man is supposed to be your protector he is supposed to keep you safe from harm not put you in harms way by physically abusing you you dont hit the woman that you love that is not love my dear dont let him ruin your outlook on love and relationships because that is no measure or example of love or of what a man is keep your head up and even though you dont know me im here if you need to vent to someone i have found that sometimes venting to somebody you dont even know is really stress relieving,0
ive been on 100mg at night for 5 years now it helps with racing thoughts and i sleep very well when i feel mania coming on i take 25mg in the day and it helps i have gained weight but not excessive it does make you hungry i take the generic called dopaquel which is a little cheaper i was also afraid to take it at first my phyciatrist prescribed it for me hope it works for you,1
i was misdiagnosed with add/hd growing up my behavioral anomalies were actually symptoms of childhood anxiety it was the 90s any kid who didnt sit still for more than 10 minutes had add to most doctors,1
i have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life i get your struggle however im sorry i totally understand his text he is completely right in his concerns,0
dont take the words of a friend as a diagnosis you must see a doctor for that nothing bad will happen you may not have bipolar but another mental illness or none at all please dont sit and worry about this see your doctor,1
op here: i spoke with my doctor and she said that i need to be working there already for me to have her fill out an ada (its a disability accommodation form which is what the company gave me) and i asked her if she read it because the first question was literally "if (name) is able to do these tasks without accommodation there is no need to fill out the remainder of the form) which then clears me to move forward with the application status what upsets me the most is that hr pressured me to disclose my mental disability despite that i said it wouldnt get in the way of work i could be working already,1
i hope you will come into contact with many others who understand on here im sure people will confirm that many of the things you are thinking and feeling are common and normal in no way are you a failure i see ads as merely a crutch to help you along the path to recovery its definitely not a sign of failure i would say exactly the opposite you are aware enough that you just need some help its a sign of strength and honesty many people need some form of help in their lives medically mental illness is no different our minds are so complex sometimes they just dont work properly i do worry though if people begin to feel better this is sometimes when we might feel we no longer need the ads and come right off them it is sometimes the case when people with a mental health condition feel that they are doing really well and begin to run before they can walk and possibly take on too much coming off medication too fast or too soon might not necessarily work if some other challenge or difficult situation comes along in the longer term its not a sign of weakness if we need them it sounds as though you ve had a lot on your plate being strong for your son it can take so much out of a parent being there for those who rely on you try not to be too hard on yourself you ve done really well in acknowledging you need some help accepting the condition is a huge step towards recovery when some cant admit they are suffering small steps are key to an eventual goal lean on those who care for you and let people help you you can do this there is hope for us all xx best wishes x,0
depression is the darkest cloud you never want to face it seeps into your bloodstream and takes ahold eventually of your spirit like a parasite it globs on to you and doesnt let go until its had its way with you the experience is scary sometimes free-falling and bleak what it cant take is all your mind and what you believe in and those are the threads by which i hang on everytime,0
im on 300mg of wellbutrin 300 trazadone 20mg-3 times a day of buspar 1200mg of lithium 4 mg of proxasin( cant spell) so i honestly dont know whats working on whats not im a recovering drug addict/alcoholic so i cant take narcotics anymore i have cycothymia ptsd add generalized anxiety disorder i feel like im on too much shit but everyone is different and how they respond to meds its hard to really get advice on that topic i hope wellbutrin helps you going thru med changes and have mental health issues and dealing with the mental health world is shitty if you ask me im just trying to make it in life and keep fighting,0
hahahaand they say im paranoid! ha!,0
bipolar and anxiety were actually included on a application i just filled out for a job i checked prefer not ti answer im starting to wonder if my hospitalization when i was 17 was popping up im in il and tried to get a foid card and that popped up,1
i am also bipolar with anxiety and adhd thrown in i actually recently had a nervous breakdown and the thing that got me through was my journal and music i reached out and realized i had very little support which really hurt i also have a therapist that helps me so much and meds of course but i am so sorry you are going through this you are not alone! and when youre feeling really low and want to bash yourself try so hard to realize that you are important and worthy be kind to yourself i struggle with that myself but you will get through this!,0
i have bipolar type 2 and have been working since last november and i live in fear of my next drop,1
for him and the guilt apologize say its not his fault honestly its not yours either its just the emotional roller coaster you go on when he asks what he can do that will help (because he loves you and our partners always want to fix it even if there is nothing they can do) say something simple say him being there and just listening helps (because it does sometimes) say sometimes you will just need a hug so you can cry (because you will) but if you are in a space where you cant be hugged its not anything he should take offense of its just sometimes its too much stimulation and anything extra can make it worse is there anything he can help with that might help with some of the stress you are feeling?just every day things? maybe you need some extra hugs? maybe you need just a moment where you are able to lie in his arms and just read or something? maybe he could help with some chores (not sure of the dynamics of the household you are in)? maybe you guys could go out on a walk together somewhere where there wont be a lot of people and it can just be you two and maybe you dog or kids (if you have any) a simple nature trail can do wonders if you just get away from everything even for like 30 minutes its not huge things but it can help it wont just help you but it will help him feel better because he will feel like hes doing something to help you because thats all he wants its just sometimes those we live with dont realize they cant fix it and it doesnt necessarily need to be fixed (though god we wish it could be) but just some simple things can relieve the pressure so much i am hoping things even out for you,0
people jus make one guilty n feel 100 times worse,0
we have borrowed the term from the english language to fit the disorder not the other way around i am an electrician and polar and bipolar are generic terms we use when i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder i understood it very clearly because i connected it with the electrical term i wouldnt get upset because when people are saying it they most likely are not comparing it in their head with bipolar disorder one or 2 they most likely have a different picture in their head altogether then you are imagining i hope this helps,1
in my experience accutane does work very well our 2 sons had horrible cystic acne during puberty their faces cleared up and the "zits" never returned if you are female  you cannot become pregnant the drug can cause severe birth defects and suicidal thoughts enough already talk to your primary care doctor or psychiatrist now you have no need to suffer there are so many treatments available to you if you dont have insurance go to a free clinic or planned parenthood they are not just about "sex pregnancy prevention and abortions" there is your school guidance counselor- they may have an idea good luck i wish you the best,1
i currently struggle with this and have for over 20 years i also think dbt is a great way to go as far as learning new coping skills when you can get the help personally i have found that drawing on myself with red markers or squeezing ice helps a bit sometimes if i have old clothes i dont wear anymore i slash or rip them i used to pick up henna kits because its kind of like making scabs i hope you can get the therapy that will help you there are people who understand though i know it doesnt feel that way right now depression lies to us that way oh and a lot of people are posting the hotline which is great but if youre like me and uncomfortable talking in the phone there is a text line 741741 big hugs and thank you for speaking up and advocating for yourself!,0
the rings it wasnt even scary and it was predictable,0
i suffer from clinical depression chronic anxiety and agoraphobia and im on clomipramine mirtazapine & lorazepam,1
i go to a therapist once a month and i still have a panic attack the day before and right up until i am sitting in his office,0
aint cured by avoiding it either all about getting the balance right and understanding why were anxious ✌️,0
the guilt nearly crucified me and like you say no one to talk to i totally empathise here have felt exactly the same if this was a closed group i could talk more feel free to pm me if you want to talk x,0
i am in a relationship with my same sex partner which suffers from bipolar myself with depression and anxiety disorder its extremely tedious 90% of the time with the unpredictability of his emotions and my anxiety having a blast off that,1
failure and fear are my problems,0
you will probably find mixed results my doc just put me on abilify because i couldnt get out of bed my energy level was 0 now i have only been on it less than a week but i can get out of bed now still low on energy but i am feeling it go up my doctor also knows i am worried about weight gain as i am 100 lbs over weight and have 5 blown out discs in my back i cant gain anymore or i will be at a loss she said for adult the older you are the more energy it will hopefully give you and shouldnt gain any weight the younger you are it will be just the opposite,0
its a side effect called akathisia i suggest talking to your pdoc about it it can get really bad its like restless leg syndrome but all over your body ugh worst side effect ever,0
i thought it made me irritable stopped and went back to prozac but that was a long time ago i was only 14,0
a dog trainer a nanny something to predict when panic attacks are going to happen,0
thank youi think too deeply into everythingneed to be put staight sometimesvictim of my own paranoia xxx,0
weed only with bi-polar? thats insane advice you trying to make her manic? if its just anxiety i agree 100% if its depression weed only masks the problem it does not treat it after the high your back at square one,1
just be understanding my wife left me about 4 months ago because she didnt know how to handle my anxiety and depression because it was so hard to explain to her how badly it changed who i was just be supportive and listen if shes worth it to you keep fighting and know shes not doing it to upset you,0
i was married to a paranoid schizophrenic unfortunately didnt work out cause were both ill but still great friends,1
its not your fault and you arent "stupid" it is not your fault i work in an incredibly busy pharmacy and i know it doesnt come close to the stress of nursing but i managed to force them into scheduling me only part time and at night its okay to work with anxiety and bipolar i have bipolar 1 and ptsd and anxiety disorder they say that working with these chronic conditions is how we can get through them theyre never going to go away and that isnt our fault granted i dont do anything at all anything on my days off i just said alot of words but the real thing i want to say is it is not your fault [heart],0
i was told to do this and it does work but here is a technique that at psychotherapist should advise you on for it to work i and a fear of dying but it got me through a c-section and i was allowed to keep the band on x,1
i get how u both feel because i do as well people with anxiety rly need people around them that try to help them because i have felt the same way about everyone would be better off without me from time to time and its hard because if you honestly dont have it you dont understand how it makes us feel they only think they know,0
dont throw out your meds!!! never stop taking any of these types of meds without consulting your doctor it can be very dangerous also when im in an elevated mood i often feel that i dont need mine and struggle to force myself to keep taking them please see the doc :),1
pushing them loves ones away before they push me away and accusing them of not loving me when guilt hits me real hard ,0
this is exactly why i avoid making phone calls or any kind! & i hate talking on the phone regardless of who it is i get super anxious,0
yesbut its easier said than done sometimes im afraid ☹️,0
managed to lose 2 st but extremely hard even with diet and exercise plus i take 200mg of sertraline and other meds its a constant struggle,0
yep anxiety is not stress it pisses me off too,0
i love this!!! i wish more people understood the effects and struggles that people with bipolar disorder/anxiety/depression and or all of the above deal with each and every day! its a constant struggle to stay on track and adapt to the changes that come up in your routine!!!! its very challenging and overwhelming but somehow someway we adjust the best we can and move on!!! i have always been embarassed for being bipolar along with having anxiety and depression i always felt like i was crazy i hated it! but recently i have learned more about being bipolar and i am gonna embrace it and make the best of it! i deserve to have a good life and i will make it the best i can despite what mental disorders i may have!!! my goal through it all is to go from saying "i suffer from bipolar disorder" to embracing it and being able to realize its a diagnosis it doesnt mean that i have to let it bring me down i will embrace it and make the best of it not just for myself but for my husband and my 2 girls that i have been blessed with!! #bipolarawareness #iwearpurpleforbipolaranxietyawarenesss #lovethesupportpage,0
i have a lawyer have since first denial i am a single mom with unreliable child support i tried to go back to work in may of last year and missed 16 of 40 working days before being fired my family has done all they can my mom is fighting cancer and has her own bills i suffer from major depressive disorder with anxiety and possible ptsd dendacies with chronic migraines i have not been hospitalized because someone has to take care of my kid even if im in bed all day atleast i am here,1
i am working on my masters in art therapy and i really would like to treat people without medicating them i dont think that should be the first go to option i have anxiety bp1 and ptsd medication has never worked for me art has just a thought,1
i can only tell you about my experience but i also have diabetes and chronic pain from migraines i have major depressive disorder ptsd and anxiety i had help from a legai aid paralegal and she was incredibly helpful i would not have been able to fill out all the paperwork without her both my physician and the psychologist i was seeing filled out paperwork to send in it took months to hear anything i was *incredibly* lucky in that i wasnt denied the first time and so i didnt need to reapply and/or see a judge most people like 99% have to file an appeal i know of only one other person who did not have to get an appeal and she lost two inches in height from a compressed spine i dont know but for me it might have been because i have both mental and physical issues good luck,1
my personal love relationship with jesus is the reason ive gotten through depression and anxiety i always run to him when anxiety hits and speak his word into the problem,1
the struggle is real !!,0
i havent got a everything will work out story i dont have a relationship thats worked and i did have kids before i got a diagnosis so getting through everything has been tough but ill tell you how i feel because i suffer maintaining relationships and i find the stress of them very hard 2 cope with first make sure you ur as happy within urself as you can be gotta have inner peace and you cant start nothing on messy foundation do things you enjoy socialise with people so you can meet new people even join a dating site if you feel confident to do so treat it more though as getting to know new people and see how things develop always take things slow get 2 know people stops things getting 2 intense and attachment that can lead you 2 get upset if people cant be the right person for you i only spoke up cause though i dont know if i can ever have a stable relationship i do believe within my heart that the right person is out there for everyone its just finding it everyone broken in some way and we all have our floors its just finding someone who can work with yours,0
id get anxiety from it i know it and probably end up abusing it itd keep me out of bed though thats for sure not a good choice for me im on latuda neurontin valium and ambien none of it is working very well im on the verge of losing it again,0
idk i get very shakey during and anxeity attack,0
i was highly allergic made my anxiety worse and slurred speech sent me back to the hospital more than once dr said to stop taking it immediately,1
bipolar is not a "title" to be ashamed of it is just a way to describe brain functioning religion also has nothing to do with bipolar either (and i am a christian) children of god can have all different forms of brain functioning whether it be bipolar schizophrenia asd did bpd "typical" etc accepting bipolar or any other mental health concern as a part of the self still makes one a child of god and then after saying that i would include some helpful article links to help educate her and others on the truth about bipolar,1
definitely communicate dont wait until way down the road to bring something up that bothers you during your engagement is a good time to practice and explore how to communicate during a stressful event utilize that!! it will help your marriage go smoother because it will help make communicating a habit,1
or i get the you cant dwell in the past forever or ive been there when they dont have it i hate especially the snap out of it if you think thatll work you have no idea what i feel or go thru,0
i can so relate to this its a terrible feeling and scary when we dont know how to make it better the hopelessness that is just overwhelming dont stop fighting it even if you dont feel like you are making any improvements keep in mind that every day you choose live is an accomplishment in itself,0
the weed does help im not saying sit around all day and smoke but just to ease the anxiety,0
it can take a while to learn to trust a counsellor what i found helpful was writing everything down and taking it to my sessions i have it to him to read and he would pull things out for us to talk about it seemed easier that way they are there to help us so there has to be some give and take oh and have you tried mindfulness for anxiety? there are plenty of resources on line plus apps for your phone it teaches you to focus your energy on anything but the anxious feeling look it up it has been s godsend for me take care,1
im not a member of this group but saw this post as a friend of mine is as a christian minister i would be embarrassed to hear any fellow church leader refer to any mental illness in such a way as a church we are not perfect but we try to support someone with any type of mental illness in the same way we would someone with a physical illness im actually attending a seminar next week on pastoral care for people with mental illness as being equipped to help people who are suffering is a key part of what we are about im sorry you were treated in such a way,0
ignorant people can sometimes be willfully ignorant please dont turn your back on your faith due to these peoples sin of unkindness find a church where you will be loved for who you are flaws and all my depression and anxiety make it very difficult for me to walk a joyful triumphant christian life someday youll find a church like my family did where a woman who publicly shared about her suicide attempt and subsequent hospitalization is now in a lay leadership role,0
hesitate?,0
do you want to be mentally stable or do you want to worry about your size? theres still ways to maintain a healthy weight wether youre on meds or not,0
you have eclipse anxietyyeah i dont get it either,1
for about a month now my anxiety has been through the roof and i am so stuck in between these two i know ill have to work extra hard to get out of this anxiety because i want to live more than anything i have so much to live for this may be hard but the fight is worth it!,0
keep a mood journal this can help a psychiatrist get a correct diagnosis seroquel is used in some people with bipolar it didnt work for me i was diagnosed with bipolar i and i had the extreme moods and voices either telling me i was better than everyone else or that i should kill myself because i am so pathetic and useless scary stuff it took me 18 mths to find a combo of meds that worked with the least amount of side effects as well as meds i saw a psychologist who did cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness this gave me tools to help myself in dealing with bipolar and predicting when an extreme would occur you can do a bit of research while youre waiting to see your psychiatrist only a psychiatrist should diagnose mental illness all the best,1
lexapro (escitalopram) has helped me tremendously with both my dpression and anxiety i take 20 mg,1
are you threatening me? "i need some teepee for my bunghole",1
treatments come in many forms dont be scared i used to be on a multitude of meds and now i only take 3 1 temazepam for sleep 5 mg ativan as needed for anxiety and o e pain pill for my fibromyalvia and arthritis but i was very unstable for yes so i no longer drink alcohol and try to eat healthy exercise and stay away from emotionally toxic situztions,1
effexor and latuda are my perfect combination for panic attacks and depression,1
everyone says its going to get better but it really is going to get better but in order for everything to be okay u have to try too not just sit there and be doing the same thing u do that makes u miserable change it up a little bit and be positive one goal in life is to be happy but u cant do that if youre making yourself all negative,0

i don’t know if this will help anyone here one of my first symptoms was allot of anxiety depression and panic attacks in my case related to soy lecithin none of you realize soy could be the root it’s in everything and you all od on it every day it’s in your makeup lip stick cooking spray toothpaste mouthwash waxes all dugs contain soy all pills contain soy vegetables and fruits at the markets anything shiny is covered in soy wax the chickens and cows are fed soy it’s in your perfume is in allot of sodas it’s in allot kids medicine im severely sensitive to it all the feeling of anxiety panic attacks brain fog memory issues and infections disappeared when i removed soy out of my life its extreme if you go that route the last thing giving me soy was a tooth i had to remove a root canal done because the filling in the root space contained soy hope this helps someone here soy makes you sick ,1
the worst is when they think that youll feel better if you go somewhere to have a change of scenery that actually makes me worse ive learned to compromise if they are trying to get me out of bed to go somewhere say out to dinner ill get up and try to get ready if im still too anxious to go we end up ordering something in that way the other person gets my time and attention but i dont have to face the outside world this is just what works for me but compromise is always worth a try imo,0
thank you for reaching out im trying my hardest to resist the temptation but life has come so stressful,0
i dont agree with you in the early years of my illness i did a lot of praying and i dont believe jesus was listening i did a lot of struggling and i found my own way,0
if it gets bad go to the hospital dont fuck around i cut my throat in november and was hospitalized for 11 days got out family abandoned me wife left lost job now im trying to rebuild my life dont wait too long if youre feeling suicidal go to the hospital now i have a nice scar no shame in going for help,0
depression is experienced in the mind body and soul ive found various adaptogenic herbs to help find counsellors or help groups find people you can reach out to there are 7 billion people on this planet ,1
i may be able to help you two out as i see kaylas point and actually agree but i see kimberly disliked your comment while yes it is a medical term and here it is being used in a proper connotation ( be it controversial) kim i believe youre upset because they didnt say intellectual disability correct?? i may be off base so sorry to assume im just trying to be a friendly gap bridger both are correct but i know " intellectual disability" is more pc and the more current term however before id the term mental retardation was used as a correct description of intellectual and mental deficits so yes in a medical support poster although the term is a little outdated its still not made to belittle or mock id just a older term for the same thing medicine is always evolving and so are we this was made to support and bring attention to many causes not bring down one i also would like to note that i believe whoever made this poster may not be in a medical field or have a strong medical background because narcolepsy is listed i have narcolepsy but thats not a mental disorder its neurological so perhaps the person responsible meant well just wasnt fully informed i believe they really did mean to be supportive but just didnt know better to use the term id,1
its different for everybody but lexipro made me sleep almost all day every day i had a headache and was dizzy but thats not why i slept i physically just couldnt stay awake it was horrible it helped with my depression in the sense that i didnt care about anything because i was asleep i also gained weight and im not sure how because i barely wanted to eat and only slept i told my dr i was done with it and wanted something else so he gave me zoloft yeah that did nothing after about 3 months i stopped taking it now 4 years later im on 200mg welbutrin twice a day and it works wonders for me everybody is different and what works for some wont work for others so just "experiment" with it but if youre having any bad / suicidal thoughts while on the meds please tell your doctor or someone that can get you help ♡,1
rapid cycling is the worst and really leaves you tired and confused i have no answer for you as i still suffer from it and it has never calmed down really even with the meds i do a lot of dbt with myself and that has helped,1
dont say that you have come so far which just goes to show you how very strong you are when you suffer with a mental illness eachday hour minute can be a struggle do you have support? does your wife understand? the best support system is the ones closest to you but they need to understand the illness and that is is consuming at times and thats okay they love the entire you bad and good please stay strong fight and keep pushing through,0
i have bipolar and a 10 year old son i had him before i was diagnosed we decided to not have any more children because of my diagnosis we were afraid taking meds while pregnant would harm the baby and getting off the meds to have another baby would harm me i did have horrible postpartum depression with my son which led to my diagnosis it has been a real challenge being there for him he doesnt understand why mommy gets tired or sick all the time i am also worried about the genetics component he has already been diagnosed with adhd and we fear he will be bipolar as well its a tough decision consider carefully,1
hooray! and dont worry about age i finished my bsn st 48!,0

i have a memory of the bathroom in the house i grew up in being white and freezing and i hated it so much i avoided using it at night it was actually blue they think i experienced some trauma that ive repressed then again the trauma couldve been that it was on the windy side of the house so cold theres lots of reasons for false memories but trauma is a biggie for them,0
i am not overly worried as they know i have issues i was a little worried about the cutting part as im not as open about my darkness as i am about my other crazy if people read it so be it i guess i am not as concerned now as i first was thank you again ,0
things will change / get better maybe the medication takes time try rest/ do things you enjoy when you feel up to it stay away from stress/ stressful ppl as much as possible do a little more each day i know its hard but many of us have been through similar stuff so you have to remember things will get beta pray to god if you want x,0

in the uk they like to put you on sertraline for depression when you find out youre pregnant as it has the least possible risks for baby during pregnancy and breastfeedingi was moved to it last year as my husband and i wanted to start trying for a baby by the time i fell pregnant this spring i was on 150mg per day decided to move down to 100mg as i felt well enough to do so but have the option to go back up if i really need to x,0

you need to see a psychiatrist asap get on some meds there is help and support out there my anxiety and depression was so bad i about gave up on life please see a psych dr i pray you will be well i finally gave in and sought help it was hard but i had to do it,1
do you know what yourself really is? because with bipolar on or off meds a simple reaction can leave you wondering whats me and whats my disease you do have a child to think of and stabilization of your mood swings while dealing with some side effects is potentially best for the whole family im not prescribing zombie doses - good mood stabilizers dont do that and they protect you from the highs and lows racing thought can be addressed with an atypical anti psychotic such as ziprasidone at bedtime and will help with these overwhelming feelings youre having too in your brain its all about chemical imbalances in the brain that need to be augmented good luck sweetie!,0
never touched or tried alcohol  no drugs and no cigarettes so its a choice to pick them up and start but yes i can turn into a disease but just cause i deal with anxiety and stuff i still deal with it without those things,1
its terrible having both ive been struggling alone for years  im tired of it im so done  sick of hurting inside,0

i completely understand it took me 2 hours to talk myself into a shower today even though i hadnt showered since friday morning then it took me 6 hours to talk myself into grocery shopping and had a panic attack in the store managed to pull it together to finish then had a panic attack driving home and was drench in sweat and so panicked i couldnt get out of my car right away when i got home  i wouldnt know how to act if i didnt over think everything,0
didnt do much of anything for me but was the absolute worst to come off of i lost 30 pounds because i was so sick i couldnt eat anything vertigo was absolutely horrid just an awful experience all around,0
frankly it was irresponsible of your dr to stop your meds quickly like that he should have given you warning that he would be leaving his practice and arranged to fax your files to a new dr to continue your treatment the withdrawals can be super awful and agitate your condition immensely disassociation depression appetite fluxes suicidal thoughts/feelings nausea/vomiting and several other things just off the two drugs you mentioned that being said you need to see a new dr asap even if you have to see your primary care dr for a months refill while you find a new psychiatrist your medication should only be stopped under dr supervision for your benefit not because a dr is leaving playing yo-yo w your meds is dangerous if your primary care dr wont refill you can seek out an urgent care dr or an emergency room visit they can verify w the pharmacy of your prescriptions and lack of refills if you no longer have your pill bottles ps- i have found the effexor tablets have easier withdrawal symptoms than the capsules you just have to take them more often may be something you want to ask about and the above persons comment about smoking pot let me say that i am not encouraging you to do anything illegal but if it is legal in your state/area i would suggest using it while your meds get back into your system it easing your anxiety alone would be helpful but please dont use alcohol your liver and kidneys are going through enough w the meds,1
nuvaring im bipolar type 2 n intense anxiety and its great for me and been on it years,1
i was hospitalized for a month last year - first time that had happened im 41 with bipolar 2 and anxiety i left my 3 kids with their dad it was the best thing i ever did; before i went i was so unwell i nearly ended everything now im doing really well never be afraid to get the help you need screw the stigma the people around you with brains and hearts will still be there when you get out xxxx,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page i share a lot about mental illness because i want the stigma to end though i doubt it ever completely go away just like racism i have been in a mixed mode and im weary,1
actually google is not all that reliable however i have to know if this statement us true and if hypersexuality is real as i have question about my own sexuality reagrding my diagnosis with depression/anxiety,1
i wouldnt take both of those they are both good but up my anxiety i take lithium and trazadone the lithium does make me a little sick though i know trying all these meds are horrible and super rough you need medication though keep trying ,1
sadly this happens all too often i only have 5 people i can depend on 3 of those being family members unfortunately this disorder brings us to be more attached and love deeper than the other person possibly could this leads to half hearted friendships not to mention that some people are unable to handle the constant mood swings and stress it causes this is the sad truth we are different and we are not normal in the eyes of society but we are still beautiful we are still useful and we still deserve love you will have only a few who can even try to comprehend only a few who can handle you at your worst and love you still the pain of losing friends and not understanding is so painful but i want you to know that even if you just have one person thats something that some people dont even have if she wants to cut ties let her you deserve friends who wont drop you for a boy or because theyre too busy,0
friend i have been through the whole gamut of depression and angziety meds and cymbalta is one of those that work well for the ones it works for and dosent work well in the long run for some i would suggests that you have a good talk with the doc and please let him know how you are feeling for your well being friend  i have been where you are very depressed and felt like all would be better with out me my fiancee is my best friend she seen my moods and total lack of desire to do anything i was in facked giving up on everything and everyone so i really do know how you feel friend and ill share this with you i went all the way to the act of taking my life thank god someone saw me and called for help  i told you all of this so you know that i feel your pain and know your true feelings so please talk to the dr and im sure many people have told you that ill be hear if you need to talk but i really mean that ill be hear i know how the thoughts and feelings can be overwhelming take care and stay in touch if i can help you are a good person and you are worth it,0
i do the same thing when my anxiety is high or i dont get enough sleep,1
yes animals help a great deal there is a product called valerian root you can get it at pharmacies and at gnc helped me some maybe it would help you also try to talk about your feelings with others and try to start a journal hope you get to feeling better soon anxiety is horrific but it can be managed good luck and take care,1
hi there it sounds as though you have been through a lot post natal depression can be awful but of course depression can re occur later good question; will you always be on them? id rather look at it in this way; rather than getting caught up with fixating on the medication as a bad thing i believe if it is helping if is making you feel better if it is the crutch that is helping you live your life enjoy your children if is it allowing you to cope then surely its got to be worth it and it is making the difference between your life working and not working i got so caught up at one stage when i had rebuilt my life and recovered in the idea that i had to come off them i thought i was coping well and knew i wasnt depressed i even went to the doctors and tried to discuss the idea of coming off them i had convinced myself leading up to the appointment that this was the best step but deep down i had a nagging doubt that if i encountered anything particularly difficult whether id be able to cope luckily my doctor was great we discussed it fully and she helped me to see that being on the medication isnt a sign of weakness its nothing to feel guilty or ashamed of and coming off them too quickly might not be the best plan i guess i knew that deep down i had just got so caught up with the idea that to be fully better i needed to come off the medication i think especially if you have a lot of stress in your life it might not be the best time to come off discuss it with the professionals talk to your loved ones but dont feel you have to rush into anything best wishes x,0
were listening! it seems like youre going though a lot right now do you have a psychotherapist? i find its really helpful talking to someone who understand mental illness she makes it about me and my feelings as a person not my illness and helps me find ways to cope and deal with stress so i can stay grounded i suggest psychotherapy to help you through this difficult time,0
the gene for my anxiety is slc6a4 according to bipolar writer and psychiatrist k r jamison the identification of a gene for bipolar is definitive,1
this is the best advice i have gotten in a long time thank you nicole!!! things r lil better today still feeling a bit overwhelmed but i know i can get thro this i need to find meds that actually work maybe a better doctor,1
thank you my question exactly im almost 40 and still cant figure out the answer & it seems no one can answer me either people just keep telling me that i have the answer but seriously thats bullshit ( excuse my profanity) from what i have recently discovered being around people who suffer from ( or people who are willing to admit they have) a mental illness truly brings the most joy peace & self worth out of all of us i spent 30 days in an adult facility and felt the most alive and the most myself for the 1st and apparently the only time in my life im once again lost no drug no therapy no amount of money can compare to the unplugged no judgment pure love you get amongst the diverse people who share our same life long struggles with mental illness of all types (different yet the same) ♡ ;,0
it is genetic in our family my sister got it if you could make it past the age of 29 and not get it then you would not i was worried till 30 i have a list of other problems i just didnt want that one to hopefully there will be betterb medication if the gen pops up in my great grand childrens lives,0
imipramine has done wonders for both my depression and anxiety the only side affect i really have is that it makes me extremely tired and nauseous sometimes so i just take it at bedtime,1
ill be honest with you until you tell the world and everyone in it to kiss your life will not change youll always feel insecure anxious silent afraid scared nonbelievable stuck ive been there it took me dying to live,0
firstly you have to be honest with your partner yes you are supposed to be honest anyway but who really shows the ugly side in the beginning right? im not saying tell the person on the first date but if you see its going somewhere sit down and have the "talk" as we all know bipolar is hard to understand and people tend to take your moods personally i printed out a lot of information for my husband but it was still hard for him to get that i wasnt angry or upset with him normal relationships can be difficult its twice as difficult if you are bipolar i stuck with my motto of "if ive done my best to educate you and you still want to use my condition as a reason to leave dont let the door catch you on the way out" hard work determination and patience is what it comes to its been 6 years and we are still strong so it can be done,0
i quit cold turkey not gonna sugar coat it shit was the same as withdrawing from meth (3years sober) for me couldnt eat stomach hurt all the time couldnt sleep shaky paranoid the list goes on,0
yeah its scary as hell! i will never ever let them prescribe that and that happened like 15 years ago,0
i prefer the term "struggling" instead of "suffering",0
i struggle also but on to a new treatment it is called tms therapy  my pcp is all for it it has a 86 percent chance to cure you i said its better to try,0
guess i should just keep my mouth shut on giving my opinion on this we are all grown ups on here thanks for the ass chewing and by the way i have clinical depression chronic anxiety c - ptsd and bi polar this is a open forum for people to talk ill never say a damn thing again hope everybody has a wonderful life,0
the person who got killed may wish they were alive to tell the tale like you they never got the option it must be hard to live with all this but consider others who will not even share here for fear sometimes we have to acknowledge life is tough and move on your chance is university to move on and put a line under the past you can either let who did this to you ruin your life or make them aware you survived and can do more you can and will achieve and do not use anything as a crutch hold that head up you can and you will do it the oprion is stay in this state which is no good and well you have tried it to see no one realy helps so fight and stay strong and move on if you do not make it sorry no one does it for you,0
my mania is angry mania its awfulout of control anger at everyone and everything its better now that im on meds but its horrid when it happens its embarrassingits scary for my familyoh the fun of bipolarits just grand,1

i firmly believe that if you are unable to take care of s child yourself dont have one bipolar disassociative disorder ptsd since i was four months old bpd anxiety i get my ass up every day and take care of my kids i know people with cancer who are in better shape than i am so yes i would say it,1
depression / anxiety isnt something you just snap out of the road to recovery is a lengthy process,1
never rule out youre psychic abilities too they often represent as anxiety and occur in people who are empaths and subsequently depressed deep-feelers,0

ortho tri-cyclen lo was my favorite until my insurance decided not to cover it all of a sudden after taking it for almost 8 years but my new one is lutera and i love it and im on meds for depression ptsd anxiety panic disorder and insomnia,1
its been 15 years since my diagnosis i have from time to time struggled with my past i have apologized to my family because i was horrible and they loved me anyway and got me help from time to time when im struggling i thank them again it helps me let go of those things idk if it will help you but i hope so,0
cymbalta is the o ly anti depressant that worked for me  it didnt help with anxiety they tried me on 120mg and it made me sick and it didnt help with pain  medications react differently for different people though i took myself off the cymbalta and i was taking 5mg of abilify they were working but my bf said pills poison you blah blah so all i take now is valium and if i take trazadone sometimes it knocks me out for a whole day and i cant have that i think its similar to serequel i was 50mg 1-3 as needed though,1
i had a horrible experience in every way on latuda but i dont know of it affects other people that badly i did like lamictol,0
my doctors told me they wouldnt put me on meds when i was pregnant because the child could have withdrawls doc only gave me visterail to help my anxiety it didnt work just hang in there,1
you could set an alarm on your cell phone,0
time to go to the doctor this is long overdue i suspect part of your anxiety is the isolation as well anxiety depression is a very isolating place to be you must phone the doctor today and try and get an appointment today in my opinion i would regard your appointment is an emergency make sure you do it it will lift the weight off your shoulders ,1
what if your struggling and no one knows how to help when you wake up from a dead sleep feeling like youre drowning when ppl tell you how to fix your situation but you cant bring yourself to do it for what ever reason im lost i dont know what to do,0
ambien saved my life i was sleeping maybe an hour a night and my health and mental health deteriorated drastically yes i finally went to sleep and i slept for 24 hours straight but once id been taking it for about a month it regulated and i wasnt sleeping all the time or tired anymore but these other ladies are right "sleep" walking driving eating and sex really does happen on it for me it was worth it i dont take it anymore and you can become dependant on it and thats not pretty for about a week after stopping i had severe panic attacks when i stopped taking it,1
wow this is me to a t but ive been told its just depression and anxiety disorder i knew it was so much more then that,1
exactly what is happening to me most nights but i literally keep it to myself cause i believe anything i say can be twisted to my therapist they try to heal what they sometimes cant understand unless they go thru it they have papers that say they are professionals in curing or help cope what we go thru but personally some things are meant to be unsaid if u personally feel like this isnt something that is going to occur in life right it in a journal is alot safer and less stress worrying if what u say can backlash at udont take my statement as advice its just something that i do to protect myself from being taken for certain words i say in front of someone that has the power to say im incapable of going home,0
or people cause anxiety and a low self-esteem even my closest friends dont invite me over,0
i live in a 10 by 12 tiny home you cant put much in it and i am happier than most people who have everything god is my rock and helps me with my bi-polar because he helps me take the focus off me my brain gets confusedmy hearing very bad when you ask god to help then read the bible for his answers to help youand pray for motivation and the desire to do what he purpose for youthen write down thoughts of your prayers each day and act on them you can see progressbutyou have to be willing to allow his helpif a person doesnt believe he exists then this wont work,1
its not scary at all itll give you some help,1
iv not read any comments just read this because it is not correct do not tell your self because you have bpd you think other that know you have this you are like this list they will think you are!!great worry:(,0
no i havent i live in an area that people will abuse antipsychotic medicine and my doctor will not write prescriptions for anything that has "street value" plus i am a recovering addict and recovering alcoholic so i am limited to what doctors will give me i have been sober from alcohol only 18 days i tried for months to get into rehab and had several trips by ambulance to the er for having seizures from alcohol withdrawal and got turned away without any help i ended up getting 2 duis in one week and ended up in jailthe jail doctor detoxed me with meds from the alcohol and i only had one mild seizure while i was there and luckily it was in front of the doctor so she knew what to do and how to treat me i am home now and on home confinementreally depressed and stressedbut i am sober :) been drug free for over 6 months,1
so true thats why its so hard to trust ppl in ur life because ur always afraid that they are going to tell someone ur personal business !!!!-,0
i mean no disrespect to you at all everyone is deserving of help they are also deserving of the understanding of everything that goes with living with mental illness my daughter lives with depression/anxiety,1
i really wish that the guy i fell in love with that would rather be scared of the stigma around bipolar that he just left me,0
there isnt any specific medication that treats bpd so any meds she will have been would have been for depression anxiety which can result in consequence of having bpd or a mood stabaliser if she also as bipolar disorder you dont say what she was on / stopped cbt especially dbt is very helpful for bpd sufferers however her behaviour may not be a consequence of any of above cheating or having affairs or abusing another person does not equal having a mental health illnesse i would sit dowm and speak honestly together about your relationship it maybe that it is over,1
side effects for me was restless legs at night,0
yes i have days like thati just sat straight up in the bedsome kind of dreamits 3:30 ami just got upfeel a little panicky,0
write everything down you need to tell him this is important for your nerves will make you forget somethings ive done it a lot and the doc needs to hear as much as you can tell him to help you to me remembering im not a doc you have more than depression but thats why you need to write it down a list the list will make you not so scared too,0
thinking of reducing my dose actually has certainly curbed my anxiety,1
do it no matter how scary it seems youll be glad you did,0
no doubt she probably the same,0
its sad that people are actually just care about your wounds on your wrists not your wounded soul most of people these days when you tell em you have mental illnesses will avoid you and start to see you like a monster,0
sounds to me like shes unsure of something her sexuality maybe??,0
unfortunately i was extremely violently sick when taking theseevery time i took one id feel faint and be sickthen every time i missed it i would be sick tooso couldnt winhorrible drugworth a try though because everyone else says differently,0
lamictal but i just started and i think it might be causing me to become aggravated in the afternoon so im gonna keep taking it to give it a chance but will stop if it gets worse i really dont want to go on lithium latuda works great for me at the right dose but my legs get too jumpy and my body is restless so i cant take it which sucks because otherwise its perfect for me also take klonopin for anxiety nothing for depression as i am resistant to all ssris and ssnris ive tried almost all of them and none worked never taken abilify did try a new med called vraylar but had a severe reaction to full unrinary retention and needed a foley catheter for 2 weeks that was months ago and im still having urinary issues with delayed urination,1
im struggling badly atmim on 1300mg of seroquel and its stopped working for the last 2 months after being on this dose for 5 yearsim going to bed at 10-11pm and am waking 3-4 times before i give up at 3ami want to give upim losing the battle and my will to fight is gone and its 7 weeks till i see my psyche and begin the dance for new meds againi just dont want to do this again,0

i had horrible reactions with all the other meds lithium is my lifeline i make sure to drink plenty of fluids and docs keep a close eye on toxicity and kidney and liver function basically trying to say different meds work differently for different people,1
this is a symptom of anxiety refer to "the book" dsm-5 talk it over with your health professional,1
i know this feeling so well my dad does kind of the same thing i know a lot of it is from the generation he was raised in and the lack of mental awareness to the general population then and now i have coworkers friends family who also just dont understand it can be very hurtful at times or even down right embarrassing for me to try and explain but i know its not the fact that they wont understand its just that they cant how can they truly understand what im living with when theyve never had to deal with it themselves even other people with the same disorders can vary in functionality and how they feel about the disorder because of their own personal experiences and sometimes we dont understand that they cant and we just have to remember everyone is at different levels of understanding another and be able to be okay with that and know that it isnt our fault,0
i hate it when panic attacks wake me up,0
for me its like becca mckain said and i also have diabetes meds pills and shotsand if i dont take them i start getting a little crazy and whole lot of panic morningnoon and evening hang in there its a struggle everyday,1
i felt a lump in my throat & always feeling like something wrong with me  if i get a lump in my leg i just know its a blood clot  go to er find out its nothing its just my anxiety,0
this might sound odd but do you take a magnesium supplement? that makes a huge difference with my anxiety i take a combination calcium/magnesium/ vitamin d3 supplement and it helps a lot over the winter my anxiety levels were getting very high and it was almost becoming debilitating im already on a 4 med cocktail and didnt want to add more pills i started researching safe home remedies and discovered that magnesium deficiency symptoms are almost the same as anxiety thats when i realized that id stopped taking them (bottle ran out and i forgot to pick up another one) after a week back on the supplement my anxiety levels dropped so nice to not have 24/7 tremors and panic attacks,1
ryan hayden sometimes it feels its the only option one has especially when they struggle so deeply with so much that others dont understand in a life they feel trapped by with family they feel are absent in their lives or they feel like the black sheep of the "perfect family" that they will never have never been part of after said persons dreams of a family of their own are destroyed by miscarriages the grief of losing a child/ren is overwhelming meds only go so far therapy and hospital stays only go so far you live in immense pain physically mentally emotionally and spiritually you feel like you are truly nothing and even though you have a great marriage you constantly feel your spouse deserves so much better its not selfish in many ways after the smoke clears so to speak in said persons mind they are actually freeing those they feel they have trapped with their pointless existence and endless negativity that those they love can now be free of the burden of what said person once was,0

work might be triggerring your depression/ anxiety at the moment meaning you might need to go on sick leave for awhile and work on yourself i dont think not working will benefit you in the long run i dont know what you do but thinking about another job if it is the job you are doing that is specifically causing issues i dont know where you are from im in uk and i work and get a certain amount of paid sick leave however the paid by my work but i was of over a year from july 2015 to august 2016 and received benefit as i was on half pay and then no pay for months but benefit a lot less than my pay its unlikely you would be put on permanent disability benefit which is sounds like your suggesting you would need to be seriously ill in hospital and unable to do anything for yourself or even talk to irger people to not be able to work i have bpd bp2 as well as anxiety and depression and i also have physical long term health conditions as there are times as ive mentioned when i am unable to work and on sick leave but when things improve i am able to return and my work is supportive you also need to be actively and on continuous treatment by a dr and medication who you can show and who will sat why you cannot work,1

meds are an important part of your well being but one of threethe other two are 1: therapy and 2: a positive influencer in your life both are a challenge to find good docs for the meds and good therapists for your behaviors/thinking are too few and many times overwhelmed yet they are essential as for the influencerthink of them as a cheerleader or a mentor someone whom both encourages and assists you with good things in your life daily if possible look me up on fb if you think i could be of help,0
okay but the only reason im alive today is because i realized how my death would affect others it took me years to reach a place where i felt like i deserved to live for my own sake sometimes in a crisis you do what it takes to stay alive yes its just a temporary fix but so is putting pressure on a bleeding wound if it keeps you alive until you can reach a more permanent solution its valid,0

yes!!!! write it down make notes talk with the psychiatrist please know it is not a one & done situation you talk to the psy then they assess and there is follow-up please push yourself be sure to share what you need if you find you have forgotten something write it down for the next time you said your "doctor" diagnosed you? if you mean your normal primary care physician they are not qualified to make such a diagnosis and i sincerely hope he is not prescribing meds for the conditions without therapist or psychiatrist input i suffer from both anxiety & depression and was that same person that you describe above please consider seeing a therapist/counselor as well as the psychiatrist this way you get treatment and medication if you need it,1

from a support persons perspective i dont "throw it back in their face" but do point out the irrational thinking and behaviours so when an manic episode is starting my loved one will understand when i say "your getting sick " and will hopefully get the proper support before all the trouble lands them in the psyc ward jail or worse dead (so far only 2 out of 3 but my biggest fear is the one we have been able to aviod so far),0
sometimes though it gets overwhelming this weekend the world fell through work stress mostly--i would love to call in sick tomorrow and extend a four day weekend into five just to spare myself the agony of dealing with the same issues ive been dealing with for months but i cant i have to be the responsible one no matter how much it is going to rip me apart to show up tomorrow,0
my god! any doctor worth their degree would gradually cut you back on your meds not tell you to stop completely having you stop such a high dosage of lithium so quickly is absolutely dangerous as well as just stopping the effexor it is within your best interest to either go to your local er to get back on your meds asap or get an appointment as quickly as possible you will crash and it wont be pretty im not trying to scare you but i had my dr do the same thing to me in 95 and i ended up in a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt if i can help you or anyone else from ever going through what i didplease take this advice and the advice of everyone else who has posted a response good luck! :),1

i struggle with this also but for me it goes back and forth of course my husband thinks when i cant sleep i must be manic can you be manic only on that outward sign? i get up usually and sit and read to keep my thoughts on a subject rather my thoughts going around and round music also helps me and a hot bath an hour before bedtime i pray you find relief,1
yes it really depends its either crippling anxiety or muscle tension or in my case restless legsprozac helps but at the end of the day you are what you think if all your gonna think about is anxiety your gonna feel anxious its all in your mind after a while youre mind and body forgets how to be normal and happyso all you know is feeling like shitpatience is everything if you have a mental illness take it one day at a time,0
i just learned this in order to identify your anxiety you have to know what feeling your having and then figure out what feeling made you have that one example: had a great day found out both my teens had plans today i immediately went from happy to sad to angry to self destruct mode and in reality i was just truly hurt im told its a learned behavior which still i dont know from where i can see why i believe it comes from a mix of being abused and people being mean and eventually being taken advantage of its very frustrating i know and it just plane sux!!!! but if your able to do that it will help took me about 5 hours to see that and a lot of talking and distracting myself will i remember for next time? i hope so hope this helps somewhat!! best of luck!!,0
im bipolar bpd and schizoaffective smoke weed daily best anti anxiety mood stabilizer out there,1

this post isnt even accurate! signs and symptoms people with bpd may experience extreme mood swings and can display uncertainty about who they are as a result their interests and values can change rapidly other symptoms include frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment a pattern of intense and unstable relationships with family friends and loved ones often swinging from extreme closeness and love (idealization) to extreme dislike or anger (devaluation) distorted and unstable self-image or sense of self impulsive and often dangerous behaviors such as spending sprees unsafe sex substance abuse reckless driving and binge eating recurring suicidal behaviors or threats or self-harming behavior such as cutting intense and highly changeable moods with each episode lasting from a few hours to a few days chronic feelings of emptiness inappropriate intense anger or problems controlling anger having stress-related paranoid thoughts having severe dissociative symptoms such as feeling cut off from oneself observing oneself from outside the body or losing touch with reality,0

i dont think shes saying that shes "catching" schizophrenia or bipolar but she can end up being depressed and anxious from dealing with his constant complicated paranoid changeable unmedicated mental states just for the record too you cant catch schizophrenia but his paranoia can eventually cause her to be paranoid as well if shes going to be his caregiver she may need to get therapy for herself she may need medication for herself she may need support from a caregivers support group she needs to seek assistance for herself she cant "help" him if she cant help herself after shes in a healthier state of mind and hes seeing her going to therapy he may consider giving it a chance again himself,1

these things youre going through and thinking of are heavy burdens my biggest concern is your self medicating and self harm thats a deadly combination please please be honest with your dr and flat out tell them when you can but first you really should go to the hospital and get care please they can monitor you get you on meds that take away the thoughts and actions of self harm and that would be one less thing on your already overloaded plate ive been there with both self medicating and self harm suicidal thoughtsect the hospital will have resources to give you for support groups for all of your issues take baby steps and yes break it down to one day at a time i even break it down to one minute at a time sometimes dont be afraid to reach out like youre doing now it takes balls to do what youre doing!! youre on the right path!! baby steps reach out to all of us here dont be afraid to pray and ask our heavenly father for help he wants and expects to hear from you he loves you!! he will help you but be proud of yourself for taking this first step!! and remember if the dr you have isnt working with you or for you find a new one it took me several before i finally found one i could be truly honest with i wish you the best my friend!! god bless!!,0

i suffer from depression alsoi have anxiety pills with me all the timewe i take them whenever i need them apparently your husband doesnt understand how it works and his words were harsh even though we know your not a junkiei would have said to him"yea im a junkieso what" and turn around and leave the room dont let it get to you! dont let it keep going around and around in your brain take some deep breathslet it go! and pray to god for answers,0
theres so many more options for you to chose from keep searching and dont give up! im on 3 different meds for anxiety and depression together they seem to all be doing the trick youll find something that works if you keep trying it took me a long time but how i feel now is worth the wait you are a beautiful soul please stay with us! ,1
i took a blood test that can show how your body metabolizes different medications not a clue how it works or what the crazy report means -looks like a bunch of #s and letters to me but it helped i was told that if you metabolize it too fast it wont get in your system and work i feel like i tried them all (serequel abilify lexapro zoloft ambien xanax cymbalta lexapro topamax zyprexa) probably others i have forgotten still trying to find the right combo but some had horrible side affects just trial and error is all you can do,1
ive been with my boyfriend for almost a year before this relationship i didnt think i would ever be in one - i didnt even want to be in one from the very beginning of our relationship we were both 100% honest with each other he knew about all my struggles and i made sure he understood that our relationship will not be easy it takes a lot of communication especially right now because we are long distance i think communication and honesty from the get go is key,0
where i live there is a 6 month to a year waiting list to even see if the psychiatrist is taking in patients with bipolar my gp is totally useless when it comes to thing like mental health but i guess i could go in to the emergency and wait 12+hrswhich just steams my anxiety thanks for all the wonderful comment and advise sure am getting sick of this almost mind game for patient who need treatment immediately:/,1

acupuncture was soothing and calming for myself i was told i looked like a different person after a session my pain was lessened and my focus enhanced my body relaxed i was at peace i also used eastern oriental medical herbs and compounds this of course sadly was not covered by insurance chiropractic medicine is also helpful in whole body restoration for myself and is covered by insurance i still take meds for bipolar also the combination of complementary medical interventions are very helpful for me one incident i can relate to you is that unknowingly i had not been taking my tegretol for 3 weeks and ended up in the hospital as my mental health rapidly decompensated until i was nothing but uncontrollably enraged,1

i have been on viibryd for about 5-6 months i think at first i was irrationally angry a lot we found a dose that works for me and it seems to have been better but i am also diagnosed with bipolar disorder so sometimes i cant distinguish if what im feeling is the medicine or if ive just spiraled into an angry few days i would say talk to your physician about upping your dosage we did so after about 15 months all in all this medicine has saved me i was on zoloft for 7 months and felt no difference viibryd helped me feel "human" or at least able to get out of bed more often than not it gets better ,0

my best advice after being on meds for 10 years be totally up front with your psychiatrist dont stop taking your meds without your docs approval you may have to try several or combination of 2 or 3 drugs it takes at least 3 weeks to start working i have an addiction problem so cant take benzodiazepines xanax valium klonipen ativan etc usually used for anxiety there are others non addicting i cant drink alcohol you should consider that as well just dont give up and the group is great ive gotten good advice and support good luck and welcome to this thing called life in our world!,1
what helps? - being in a safe place feeling loved having family or friends who want nothing arent telling you what to do and cause no stress :),0
sorry its so long but hope it helps meds are a struggle,1
get off the seroquel while you can horrible drug,0
i internalize everything to avoid issues but in the end i end up hurt,0
have a look at mindfulness on the net there are even apps for your phone it has been a godsend for me dealing with anxiety and full blown panic attacks,1
not the guilt kim ❤,0
first thing dont get overwhelmed change the small things u can manage first break it down to small tasks some are unchangeable erase all guilt and/ or self pity start with ur daughter and dogs look on the bright side wen u can for instance no water damage that could have been worse make urself happy before you begin to look for sumbody suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem not preaching i jus know were u are at get out in the sun around nature and people we dont want our children seeing us like that it can be a learned behavior hope i helped at all,0
i feel for you so much can you not go to your doc or speak to a midwife i suffer too and when i was having my baby felt the same wayi managed to open up about this to my midwife and she noted everything down in my notes they kept a really good check on me right through my pregnancy once i give birth they put me on medication straight away please open up its nothing to be ashamed about you would be surprised the amount of people and new mothers out there that feel the same way also once my child was born and put in my arms the love you will have will surprise you it will be hard but there is a lot off support out there please open up and talk to someone god bless you x x,0
yes sometimes i was diagnosed at age 12 and am 31 now it may be worse with age because there are more responsibilities to worry about but ive been trying all sorts of medication combinations and therapy and have learned to manage my bipolar better (i am ultradian bipolar - mood swings in days or even hours) it also helps to have support from friends family and even those of us here online who also experience the same issues we are here for you even if we dont know you ,0
go it sounds like you need to theres no shame in making sure youre well,0
the anxiousness when having to eat in front of others wow! ive had this problem for years! just didnt realise it was an actual symptom seriously didnt know it was so bad i could eat in front of family really struggled hated eating out still do but ive overcome it a hell of a lot i even found it difficult to eat in front of my boyfriend,0
interesting viewpoint i always say that i am autistic because i dont believe that autism is a disease therefore i dont have it my entire existence is defined through my perceptions which are undoubtedly and thoroughly autistic i can totally see this viewpoint though bpd probably feels more like a disease going by what people have said i wouldnt want to be defined by something that sounds so uncomfortable,0
feeling nothing is almost worse than feeling depressed i get scared more at the nothingness,0
also you occasionally yelling at her isnt going to cause her to have a mental illness she is at risk due to genetics also extreme trauma/abuse can cause mental illness so assuming youre not beating her or molesting her youre not going to cause her to suffer the same diseases she is at risk due to genetics but because youre knowledgeable youll know to look for the warning signs and know to get her help should she need it my parents were pretty perfect i have always been unconditionally loved and supported and i still ended up with bipolar and anxiety! so dont freak out about screwing your kid up a ton of therapists specialize in kids and can help her understand,1
my anxiety and depression is so bad i cant leave the house i also feel like people are always watching me,0
yep zoloft made me so uncomfortable and flu like symptoms i came off it in just a few weeks,0
i tried therapy and my anxiety and depression spiraled out of control and told my psychiatrist and she didnt offer a way to deal with it and i was in & out of the er from having panic attacks even after taking the meds and the er & my pcp told me my meds needed to be increased and she didnt want to hear that either so what do i do,1
well i was brought up that asking for help is a sign of weakness still struggle with this everyday,0
100mg of seroquel left alone is enough for you to avoid drivingdamn,0
it is so sad that you have been let down by your employer when you originally thought she would be supportive im sure that has not helped you at all im hoping your doctor is helping you and you can visit again if you need to has he prescribed any medication to help? if you are in the us i dont know the rules on employment it doesnt seem right that she is pressurising you to leave only you can decide on what to do whether the job is right for you with mental illness we can blame ourselves and feel guilty its really not your fault you didnt choose to be like this yes emotions can be all over the place it certainly can be dreadful sometimes i hope you have people to help and support you lean on them xx,1
its ok to feel scared your starting over being home which is a great thing you have opportunities to do what you want when you want its all in timing you have time to do things at your own pace every step counts for something i wish you all the best,0
sweetie dont worry english is perfectly fine trust me when people try to correct me over here i dont pay no mind i used to get mad but not anymore,1
it really helps with my bipolar depression and anxiety,1
this is charlie shes my brothers and a literal "scaredy cat" i took this picture because it was the first time shed ventured into the living room without getting scared and running into someones room and under a bed ,1
geodon is horrid the withdrawal is worse ever experienced than any other drug or benzoas well causes heavy weight gain,1
i probably should ignore them but i dont  i flat out tell them they are wrong and that way of thinking is damaging  and if they dont believe in doctors they should keep it to themselves  i always associate it to blood pressure pills and cancer treatments and tell them to go to those people as well with their "praying it out ",0
stigma is the biggest global social issue and hiv is one of the biggest global health issue stigma affects race religion culture health status etc and we fall into one category hiv we are either hiv negative or positive my self and my team member from around the globe are working on creating the app that will help in curbing this problem for millions or maybe billions of people around the globe think you care so much about seeing a change in the world we need someone from this group we can talk to about depression and anxiety so help us tackle this problem better im also one but i need someone elses accessment,1
i know my bipolar both on and off of meds i prefer being on them i am less terrified of life im glad that you can live off of them but i surely cant and believe me ive tried,0
anxiety depression bipolar disorder can be easily overcome once you understand how your mind works i had bipolar disorder myself for 10 years now i am med free and back to normal i am helping other people overcome their issues if interested message me,1
do you struggle with separation anxiety in relation to your ptsd? i lot of that is coming through to me in your post my sense is the relationship is highly volatile and charged and emotional and ultimately not good for your condition but it would take some intensive counseling for you to work through your feelings and get to a stable footing good luck!,1
to wean you off is one thing but to just stop taking it all of a sudden could be risky,1
i am very self aware (shocks the hell out of my counselor sometimes) and no it is not "easily overcome" at any point even though i know the coping skills even though i may know why im feeling the way i am at that point even though i for the most part understand the disorder and have done extensive research on my diagnosis it has never been "easily overcome" it is something that i have to work hard at daily and some days i am just too mentally emotionally and physically tired to handle much of anything i have my days when i have very few spoons to start my day and i struggle more so on those days once again this is not something "easily overcome" for most people with these illnesses,0
i have anxiety to cope with but i try every day to cope and do my best its hard but im a survivor,0
i have caused muscles to tense up swelling and weight gain,1
ive been to the er because i had chest pains mine was also stress related now that im on medication ive no longer had those symptoms,0
i do occasionally have the shakes in my hands and the rls symptoms at night not enough to make me change my regimen never had the rash,0
you can still love and support someone without having to be with them if thats what you choose to do but i think at this point it would be too sudden to get back together with him him proposing to get back with you is a huge red flag to me that hes desperate to get you- a stable factor- back in his life whatever it takes to do that sweetheart tred carefully promises are nice but your mental health comes first before his and divorce is expensive,0
the ability to sleep regularly having a good appetite but not overeating being able to take care of ourselves and not take unnecessary risks having a manageable anxiety level having the ability to think and be organized being motivated to get out of bed in the morning not being too irritable being able to listen to people without interrupting being able to express ourselves well being able to work towards some satisfaction in life being able to have some self worth some peace of mind and good solid relationships are all things we want to have in our lives if our moods or our mixed up thinking is interfering with these things then we need the meds,1
i used to do this you are trying to find things that make you happy or keep your focus away from at the stress and overwhelming emotions getting yourself pretty things gives to something to do and you feel good doing it at first the main thing is to try and find other ways to support maybe working out going for a walk with friends colouring etc something you like doing that might not cost money but will distract you,0
thank you for your honesty most folks have no ones how it effect you and the turmoil you feel over what others would think is know big deal my hand daughter is 22 she quit taking her meds when she got out of schoolit kills me to see her just be pissed all the time i was stay at home pa she told me when she was little i was like having 2 grandmasso were close when she would finally get to me i would say to her i love you but go play in the road this changed her she would smile and the mood would change for hours any advise to help her get back on her meds a desperate pa,0
xanor helps me with my dreams its for anxiety but makes me sleep and dreamlesa,1
i take 2000mg sodium valporate 100mg zoloft and 300mg seroquel bipolar nos borderline personality social anxiety disorder,1
you need to express how you feel to someone you trust let all that anger sadness etc out! with anxiety do some exercise i used to do this breathing technique when i had anxiety and it helped me out so much just take deep breaths in and out until you feel very relaxed it helps a lot i havent had anxiety for a long time(: depression was very hard for me i basically went through depression my whole life because of my parents go for long walks do all the things you love to do like sports or hobbies i hope this works out for you also know what triggers your anxiety so you can control them! if you ever get anxiety attacks do the breathing techniques!!! try to get it off your mind dont get frustrated if it doesnt work the first couple times i promise it will! dont go get therapy i did it and they dont even do anything they are just there to hear and thats it,1
different types of bipolar could be rapid cycling but best way is to seek professional advice if youre worried about it ,0
thank you so much for the comments and advice everyone; i am really overwhelmed by the support,0
sacrificing your physical health fir your mental health is not an acceptable choice get with your doctor to search for meds for other options no shame in asking about it weight gain and the impact on your health (physical and mental) are no joke,1
i have been talking to my therapost which is a military ptsd specialist he is not a fan of scrip drugs and says the side effects are very dangerous he believes exercise like hiking good diet talking and cbd oil are a good combo to start with i as well uave been on benzos and they are highly addicting i thoght i wa going to die getting off of zanax quiet calm is my key when im gong to louder situations i hike before hand to make sure im am grounded i think the best thing is to avoid things that are difficult until you have the confidence to deal your body and mind have alarm systems telling you if your taking or doing something wrong listen to it,0
i gained a huge amount of weight i was tired all the time and had terrible nightmares and night terrors so thankful to be off it!,0
unfortunately lots of doctors are that way because ativan can be addictive and they do not want us relying on it im supposed to use my techniques i learned at therapy to combat panic attacks and depression,1
13 and 9 are daily struggles,0
the world has turned its back on me im only guilty of merely existing,0
first be supportive second try and work with his moods if hes up suggest going shopping together like say we need new towels go pick whatever and how many you want and well sort through them after or we need a movie night lets pick a few movies from this section (the $5 to $20 section) when hes being destructive talk to him dont yell and dont say its hurting you while hes still in that mood tell him his feelings are valid and talk about them when i say that i mean like its okay you feel paranoid about the thing please tell me why so i understand and can see this from your point of view not oh its okay to hit the wall because youre angry when hes depressive bring him water ask about his day tell him its okay he just slept all day ya know do the little things shower with him if you can try new things in the bedroom start with sensation play tickling and running different things on his skin let his nerves feel i dont suggest pain sensations dont spank or prick the skin with anything sharp let him know youre there for him,0
i have been on it forever definetly helps with deppression the only bad thing is now i cant get off to try anything new because the withdrawl is horrible,0
yes ive had bipolar disorder for about 55 years but was diagnosed only about 30 years ago i was a teacher and the strain of putting on by happy face daily finally pushed me into a very early in retirement im very hard to treat so the best i can get is to be only functional ive been isolating now for a long time so i know im not in great shape,0
no one that lives around here i isolate so i have no friends except my family my bubble is my world i dont leave except when i see my psych doctor but then my family has to drive me since i wont drive anymore and doctor is about 30 minutes away bipolar anxiety panic ptsd disassociation are hard to deal with too there is no place in the town i live that has support group,0
the doctor would take into consideration the side effects verses the good of both mother and babythats what she is sayingthat shes worried about the baby and herselfencouragement not judgment,1
i know your your struggle shawna seriously i have had bi polar depression and anxiety and all my life it is and can be a very hard road at times i to have come so very close a few times in ending my life  and i wanted this so much but then i got a second wind and thought dam it this isnt going to beat me or take my life my life is to precious to give up and throw away just like that i have just came out of a very dark horrible place of depression cause i had to and had to pull myself up out of bed find my motivation it wasnt easy be i had to for my own mental state we didnt ask for this but is the hand we were dealt so we cant just throw in the hand we have to focus on what we really need and want to be doing it can be crippling when the bodys muscles are seized up through being bed ridden but we must move forward shawna keep telling yourself you are not giving in you want to find your balance in your medication with the doctors help and please tell your self your exsistence in this world matters and yes you do matter we love you and all of us on this page feel where you are comming from life wasnt made to be easy honey but we all need your presence in this life you matter your family matter and care and love you and all of us on this page want you to tackle this barstard depression etc and say no you are not winning bottom line we all love you if you only but knew this please stay with us and help us aswell thank you shawna xoplease stay strong now *,0
marcus i am very sorry you are dealing with this right now actually i turn 25 today and the past few years have been really hard for me sounds like youve been doing a lot of wheel spinning too frustrated tired discouraged that this is it for your options and they arent working i cant say i know your experience but im betting those components listed are there at your doctor i would tell them straight up what you said regarding the meds to us that you are afraid to go back on that because it only made things worse i applaud you for having the courage to speak to strangers on here and also making that dr appointment courage energy and rational thinking- and you have all of those you have much to miss in this world stay around if you can i know it is hard to see past the hell you are going through i get it so in that case wait until tomorrow when you can see past it again whether tomorrow is 24 hours from now weeks months that tomorrow will come sometimes you cant force yourself to be optimistic but you can look forward to the day when you can if anything id say try to wait that moment out i think you have the strength and will as you have been able to take some big steps in talking to us and making that appointment there are those that struggle in taking those steps keep fighting dont hesitate to talk to us on here,0
you are in a difficult situation and that is you are a person who is being mistreating you your husband is probably fearful of going to see a therapist as it is admitting that he actually has a problem there is also the fact that you need to protect yourself and your children if you do leave him again perhaps it may be a good idea not to go back until he has seen someone otherwise you will be going round in circles and there will be no resolution i am sure youve thought of this yourself and i am sure you go back because of persuasion and the fact that you love him things will only improve when he has seen someone and received some help i hope this helps you,0
still struggling nothing works i could just be a total piece of shit in reality- regardless of my medication,1
you might feel like total shit! i felt like i was withdrawling nausea upset stomach irrirable etc i try to keep a few as back up from each script because i am terrified of those feelingsugh seroquel can be brutal going on and coming off circumstantially or not i have taken benedryl to get a few hours of fitful "sleep",0
adaptogenic herbs in particular rhodiola rosea have helped a lot with my anxiety and depression ,1
i had 8 sessions over 3 weeks this past june my psychiatrist had me stop because my short term memory was non existent i am starting to get some back but did not help with my depression and made my anxiety through the roof,1
i did say most people there are plenty out there that cant tolerate them im sorry for your struggle this thing is a crazy ass beast! :(,0
im on topamax for migraines ive lost about 15 pounds in just over a month my taste buds are completely different and my appetite is shot so even though ive basically been stuck on bed rest because of spine surgery i lost the weight its rough to titer up on and its not called dopamax for nothing but if you can stick it out some of the dopey issues gets better im still losing weight the food aversion and taste bud issues are still there but im learning what i can tolerate and what i cant avoiding sweets and fatty foods helps a great deal it seems to not agree with topamax ive been eating a lot of veggies grains less meats lots of water no coffee it makes me be healthier or it doesnt let me eat it or drink it and i honestly crave the healthy stuff i do have issues with some fruits though again its the sweet aversion thing ive heard some people who lost nothing felt nothing some who couldnt handle it at all i admit the first few weeks were rough it does depend on your dose as well,0
wow!!! i never knew in school i would literally try to make myself as small as possible so as to not be touched publicly i have always hated shopping alone or paying for stuff alone i get all red faced and embarrassed i really hate eating alone as i feel extremely fat not just a little bit but like i am suddenly triple my size i cant even go christmas shopping without dragging a friend along to keep my nerves calm heck 1 time even with them i wound up sitting on the floor crying for no reason and all they did was sit on the floor next to me and talk me through it then we were able to continue,0
i would stick it through the appointment next week- see if he is willing to go back on some sort of mood stabilizer- you might have to set up an agreement about supervised meds (he leaves them so you can see that he is taking them) without the meds this is only going to get worse so then you have a right to protect yourself- a trial separation might jolt him a bit into making the changes he needs you mentioned sleep apnea- interrupted sleep is a huge issue for bipolar- does he have some sort of machine or oral device to stop the apnea???? i know the affair is hard- know it is probably the bipolar talking but not sure how much that helps i have been bipolar 1 for 45 years- just had an huge long deep mania- at some point i listed our house for sale!!! now that they decided i can indeed have the only mood stabilizer that works for me (tegretol) and i am back to a therapeutic level i realize how horrible i was to my husband and i apologize several times a day- i made very concrete plans to leave him during the three months and was in general a bitch to live with now that the docs have quit doing experiments with me i love him so so much for being able to stand it all all i can say for me is the medications are key- the side effects are horrible and piss me off every time i look in a mirror and see how fat i am and every time i am thirsty but can have no liquids (they took me off tegretol due to a low sodium level- no other mood stabilizer worked and for a year i just went crazy- now they have decided i can have the tegretol but have to limit fluids and eat/drink a ton of sodium) bipolar is a serious disease and just going without the meds for a prolonged period is really really hard it is not something you can think yourself out of will be happy to chat with your husband if you think he would talk to me/and that it would help,1
werid are you on a mood stabilizer? been under extra pressure?,0
staint johns wort is all natural it helps both with depression and anxiety but if you are on meds please ask your doctor first,1
i actually recently heard that you can have ptsd w dissociative features ive had this happen if you dont remember something and are worried about it if you feel comfortable ask about what happened could help ease your mind a little,0
its tough out there its a constant struggle with life always there to kick you in the ribs when you fall,0
i always sucked at birth control too! i ended up getting the needle for a few years im scared of the iud! ~dani,0
i have gained a ton of weight but the benefits out weigh my weight currently i am on 300 but i have on as much as 600 whitch makes really tired and unable to function it takes away my nightmares and night terrors!,1
never! there is always hope as long as there is breathe! i have had suicidal thoughts i know that this all is a spiritual battle and that god helps us when we come to him in prayer i have a slogan for those times when things are at the worst it goes like this " things won"t always be this way" i have to tell you that we must fight a spiritual war to survive sometimes we have to choose life jesus has given me the hope to get through the toughest times i may fall apart for a while but i know that i have solid reasons to go on living! dont ever ever allow yourself to dwell on the thought of giving up you have a choice to make in what you think about billy graham said something that stuck with me that applies he said that "just because a bird flies over your head does not mean that you have to let it build a nest in your hair!" makes sense to me we can choose our thoughts we can read for me it means meditation on the bibleon spiritual reality and promises from god himself and reading how he has been faithful in the lives of others it gives me strength and hope and speaking of strength and hope we can pray for strength and hope and every other solid spiritual gift we need we can pray for wisdom and guidance from god the truth is we give up way too easily and let it become a habit you have to fight for your mental health to succeed means that you fail and get up and fight for it again and again and again each time you get up you gain strength and determination because you learn that you can take a rest but that you can and will get up stronger yes stronger stronger from going through defeat yet not being defeated! you are still alive still trying and losing even the faintest thought of giving up god put you here on this earth for a purpose he wants you to enjoy knowing him and enjoy knowing others in a very healthy way we are all in this together people from the dawn of time have experienced deepest depression i love to read the book of psalms when i am feeling low or fighting a big battle or feeling physical pain or have to get right with god or find myself feeling like god is far away sometimes we are just too exhausted to pray david in the psalms gives us the words to pray to god under the worst of circumstances we can cry out to god like he did and be saved from the pit of depression fear aloneness pain trouble and attack by whoever and whatever so many times we do not understand that we are in a physical attack that has spirtual origins we do not understand that we are spiritual beings living in phyiscal bodies we can not reject the spiritual ! if god is for us who can be against us? satan is still against us we must fight every day but it is not meant to be such a struggle if we do it in powe we get from god in the person of the holy spirit given to us to be in us to empower us on earth jesus said that he would not leave us orphans he would come to us in the person of the holy spirit and never leave us ever we can count on him for help how can depression win against him? we must be in his hands and he must be at our side open the bible and recieve the hope that you need for this life and for eternity god is not mocked and we reap what we sow but if we leave sin behind and come to jesus honestly in repentence of sin and embrace life with him daily seeking him we shall be saved and our depression will be lifted bit by bit we will see who he is and he will heal us as we seek him day after day in reading his word and in prayer start reading the gospel of john and actsand ask for help from a pastor or believer if you get suck understanding some things but most of all pray as you read the word of god it is the holy spirit who will become your teacher and you will understand and find great joy and peace in the presence of the living god he will take away the mourning and give you something to feel like dancing about it is not that tough times will not come the world is evil and we suffer but if we suffer if we allow god into our lives close enought to comfort us and guide us we will have real joy and peace in his presence that is not dependent on our circumstances sometimes we need special prayer said by spiritually strong men and women the power of great faith to perform miracles with the touch of a hand or word comes from the power of the holy spirit there are many ministries that profess to be of god but we are told in scripture to test the spirits to make sure that it is the holy spirit doing teaching and the healing we can ask for this guidance to know where to go for help and encouragement in our walk with god a ministry that is of god will not teach anything contrary to what is in scripture never give up! never give up seeking gods help to keep on fighting to get stronger and stronger defeat is just how we learn sometimes we just need to rest and make some carefully thought out life changes god be with you always in the name of jesus,0
i was reaffirming a post not sure what youre confused about,0
im on exactly that combo for mdd and panic disorder,0
i used to have episodes like yours my docs will not prescribe benzodiazapines for anxiety because they are addictive and you have to reduce your dosage gradually or you will experience withdrawal symptoms not good a couple of years ago my psych prescribed buspar (busparone) and it completely changed my life so effective for my severe anxiety and obsessive compulsive behaviors absolutely the best psych med ive ever used lots of the people in my support use it and they feel the same way i have no side effects just a little drowsiness when i first started using it i do feel a big difference if i forget a couple of doses symptoms will come back i highly highly recommend it,1
this is why i am single with no children ive just seen my fella through two years after he had a meltdown down  i helped him because i know from experience what he needed but earlier this year i ran out of steam and my bipolar kicked in i thought he would understand my anxiety and depression as he was so recently there himself but not a chance its all about him and he only wants me for how i can help him when hes down guess what? after a lot of heartache im single again it takes someone really amazing to understand and support someone close when the black dog strikes,1
i respectfully disagree with ur comments regarding both lithium and effexor lithium is the first medication i have been on that is starting to help stabilize my mood since i was diagnosed 5 years ago effexor sucks! i was initially put on it for depression it made me so irritable and agitated that i turned into a raging bitch i almost lost my job as a result of it,1
i set alarms on my phone & keep the bottle in my fist until i do!!,1
hated it it actually made my anxiety so high i was afraid to leave my apartment will never go back on it,0
your going through withdrawal i take 400 and as it is i will be needing mine to be raised 4 its not working any longer i have been on 400 mg since the age of 15 i am now 28 missing one dose causes automatic withdrawal of shaking and nausea your best bet while ur waiting is to go to the emergency room and get a prescription from them until ur doctor can give u one thats what i do when i run out,1
yes but i got diagnosed with anxiety along with depression and the anxiety meds made all the diff!!!!,1
i take propranolol for both anxiety and severe heart palpitations it doesnt help with my anxiety at all but it works amazing for my heart palpitations!,1
have you tried a medication called buspar- it is a nonaddictive option for the anxiety and that is the primary use for it i too have a lot of gi symptoms that on occasion make me sure something serious is happening but i am a medical professional so i keep trying to talk myself down- recently had a ct scan of the abdomen which is the gold standard for diagnosis of serious problems so i know it is just the anxiety i started the buspar a few months ago- worked up to 15 tablets twice a day but blurred vision made me contact my md who changed it to 2 tablets at bedtime- good relief of the blurred vision but has left me a little more anxious due to the decreased dose so i will contact him again like all meds hard to find the perfect dose at the get go but we keep trying give the elavil a try it works for many gi symptoms bipolar 1 x 40 years,1
i always set an alarm on my phone plus my fiance reminds me,0
im so sorry that sounds miserable :(,0
this is my son with his kitty lunashes his lifesaver and anxiety/stress reliever a guy and his cat!!,0
she is experiencing psychosis let her dr know that you are in an emergency situation & that she is hallucinating & showing signs of psychosis i had an episode of psychosis about 10 years back had hallucinations for the first time it was the scariest thing i have experienced unfortunately i was told (& turned out to be true for me) that once a person experiences hallucinations when in times of extreme stress anxiety etc i start having mild hallucinations at least now i can usually tell what is a hallucination & what is real i smell smoke sometimes ive heard a dog barking in my room but there is no dog hallucinations are not only visual they need to do something about the hallucinations i hallucinated my house was on fire it got to the point that they needed to add an anti-psychotic medication some examples are: abilify geodon zyprexa seraquel & many others most of these meds cause a lot of weight gain geodon has the least affect on weight if you ever need advice or just someone to talk to please message me,1
oh yeh! weeks of restless sleep compounding the anxiety we normally feel! no-one who hasnt suffered it understands the hell this illness puts us through!,0
star honey my temper definitely has changed years ago i use to get so angry not sure what changed it but i dont get as angry but i do find myself annoyed by the smallest things and yell at my kids and later regret it i am on meds for depression for anxiety my sex drive has lessened some but it seems once i find the right guy it seems to trigger the bad part again ugh thanks for sharing,1
cant they change ur meds / stay away from stress and look after urself  things will get better and you will be able to do more,1
i think it will be the best med for your boyfriend without a doubt ,1
i was on 100 mg of zoloft while pregnant its perfectly safe and ask for latuda its a medicine used to treat bipolar and its safe for pregnant and nursing mothers was pregnant with my son on both and nursed him on both they would want to reduce the zoloft at maybe 37 weeks so that your baby doesnt suffer from withdrawal he might be extra sleepy or fussy or a bit shaky as a result im actually pregnant right now too almost 5 months my psychiatrist has me on haldol its low risk for pregnancy it makes me really sleepy but i have almost no meltdowns anymore its the best medicine ive ever been on good luck mama and hugs!!! :),0
what catagory does paranoia goes by?,0
ok first of all marae corday there is no snapping out of anything no more than snapping out of schizophrenia my husband suffers from this disorder and it can be devastating and no one with this disease chooses to be this way second of all just because someone has bipolar disorder doesnt mean they are stupid or incapable of being independent or self reliable that all depends on the severity of their disease and their individual progress with treatment there are actually a great deal of very intelligent and successful people including celebrities who suffer from bipolar their is no doubt that someone with bipolar must have a strong network of family and friends to be supportive and help them when they need it but let me assure you that mental illness is in no way a first world problem as you like to call it mental illness stretches beyond all social classes race culture religion etc i can assure you it is very much a global problem the only difference between our "first world" and other "third world" countries is the attitude and acceptance of which we acknowledge and treat mental illness here for example most americans have compassion and acceptance of mental illness without blaming the person who suffers while a smaller number of douchebags such as yourself have no understanding or sympathy of anyone elses pain except your own and just expect people to snap out of something they can not control let me tell you one thing right now there has always been a disgusting stigma associated with mental illness that it is somehow bull shit or can be prevented or avoided which is further perpetuated by people like you but there is absolutely no difference between mental illness and any other physical diseases such as cancer or diabetes it is a physical chemical/hormonal imbalance of the brain would you tell someone with cancer or diabetes to snap out of it? if you cant educate yourself on such matters and have an enlightened and intelligent point of view on such matters then it would probably be more beneficial for you to refrain from commenting your idiocy because it reflects poorly on your character and makes you look like a horses ass,0
is effexor xr you want the extended release but if you start taking it need you need to take it consistently because if you miss a dose i know i have horrible nightmares and became spaced out i know when i doctor added adderall to my med line up in 2010 it was a life changer for me it boots the antidepressants i dont feel antidepressants or mood stabilizers alone do crap they just keep us down need something to boost us up keeps me awake functioning and productive totally different person got this information from carrier clinic saved my life,0
i was on aripiprazole (abilify) for a considerable length of time i credit my psych and this drug for allowing me to become the person i am today it essentially saved my life! i find the fact that people who experienced side effects may be eligible for compensation disconcerting am i eligible for compensation based on the side effects i encountered whilst on other medication before i found what worked for me? i very much doubt it these side effects are listed in the data sheet and crucially what works for some may not suit others,1
im so sorry you are struggling your words are deep and i totally relate im not good at conveying my feelings due to my anxiety i guess so what you wrote hits home for me ill say a prayer for you whether you believe in god or not because thats what i do ❤,0
jennifer ager okay so idk if its okay to tag you in but i immediately thought of you & im super fucking sorry if this upsets or offends or affects you negatively,0
yes i can understand as i have depression and anxiety as well as vitiligo it isnt easy at any given day ,0
before you get a girlfriend you have to get your head together i also was sexually abused by men youre rightit affects every relationship however help is out there self-harm and self-medicating will not do you an ounce of good in the long run if you want a girlfriend and maybe children you have to stop letting the abuse control you master it like you would master playing the piano it is scary at firstbut with professional help it is doable build a support system around yourself and a close relationship with your therapist choose a best friend someone you can confide in use these tools to rise above the abuse it is time to lance the boil and get the poison out! i believe in you believe in yourself!,1
i remember my prn pain and anxiety meds though! imagine that! just not my routines ~dani,1
syraquil i use it at night it helps with anxiety and a side effect is drowsiness it doesnt intensify your dreams either,1
i know this doesnt solve anything but try finding a book series or tv show that you can really get into it helps both my husband and i to be distracted by something when were feeling anxious/scared/depressed you may even be able to train your brain to relax just by having the show on in the background again i know its not a fix but sometimes we need a temporary solution while we wait for the bigger fixes (like meds and counseling and the like) to start working their magic,1
weed can make anxiety worse and bring on panic attacks go to your gp and tell them (dont ask) that you wish to be referred to the mental health and you then get medicated good luck and take care,1
thats me in a nutshell!! its scary and lonely i try to het out of it you know get outta my head but somehow i keep winding up right back in it,0
i took latuda but i had a bad side effect to it i became like a zombie i would shake and just zone out its called ackaethesia (sp),1
such a fear of medication screw ups ha cant even think of the right name for it smh bottom line is i couldnt live with hurting or worse killing someone!,0
so true every nite i pray i die in my sleep but in reality all i really want is to b happy and for my family to b happy and love each otha sick of living and feeling this way the sadness the sense of failure the guilt and over whelming sense of hopelessness and having to pretend everythings ok its exhausting my family will neva fix itself and i pray for a beta way but thats neva gonna happen so praying for a quik painless death is the nxt best option,0
i was diagnosed last year and its a struggle :(,0
no source offered for the picture could just be made up or a picture of a brain of someone stuck in traffic could also be a picture made by sanding through multiple layers of paint on a used car that aside: everyone is good and worthy of love and humanity irrespective of similarities or differences illness heritage skin color etc normal is something fearful conforming boring people call themselves when faced with creativity diversity and psychology strive to be a great you be thoughtful be open minded and you will realize that normal is only an illusion the universe is better with you in it,0
thank you for posting this! how does a brain know when its sick? if people just mock them or avoid them it stays the same be patient but persistent on how to deal with triggers it is very difficult dealing with others problems but if you love them its worth it when taking meds make sure the person has shown improvement of some kind sometimes theres more than 1 med for a disorder make sure you eat foods that are high in seretonin norepinephrine & etcbecause the meds dont produce more of it they just keep the ones your body produces from escaping their path & dying with these disorders your brain doesnt produce enough of them which causes the disorder just try it & see if you notice a difference just google seretonin etc & find what foods you like nutrition is very important for the disorder and not many drs and counselors explain this completely where people understand it write down everything so if you forget then its still right there or have someone you trust go with you to get the info in case you missed something also exercise as much as you can and whatever you can do cause the euphoria also helps a lot if anyone out there didnt know this please please try this & see if it helps or help someone you know with the disorder having worked with kids that have brain disorders it is so gratifying when you see them improving keep positive for the one with the disorder because they cant until theyre stable ‍ ‍ ‍ ☺️ ,1
im with you the winter was horrible and im trying to be motivated but it just isnt happening all i want to do is sleep ,0
i miss the manic too x i just feel the same every day i never get overexcited anymore but coming down from the high is something i dont miss but dont come off your meds your doc knows their stuff i also have anxiety and stress well depression insomnia but im agoraphobic now too so im housebound 24/7 enjoy your new job and yes stay off the caffeine lol x,0
let me try this again u must come first itd easier said then done but ur sanity is more important if u dwell on this youll bring ur self down and i know u dont want that to happen take care and i wish u the best ive been there,0
i have anxiety depression bipolar agoraphobia and panic attacks i am on zoloft for my anxiety and depression which works good but keeps me awake at night i take trileptal for bipolar and it works good and helps me sleep i take ativan for panic attacks and i only use it as needed because it makes u feel like a zombie,1
im the exact same way i worry and worry and every month the bills are paid,0
might i suggest vippasanna meditation or at the very least practicing mindfulness? it helps against panic attacks,1
exactly and im glad people are coming down on the other side of the coin on this i dont need a guilt trip for being colloquial if im telling my friends im having a manic episode i say "im manic" ill probably type the full proper language out of fear of chiding from the ableism gods but who needs that bs?,0
no my job is a huge source of stress for me (starting a new one soon) and my husband doesnt believe my diagnosis i dont really have friends either,0
i love it! i take it for my manic depression and it does wonders!! it doesnt seem to help me with my anxiety though were about to up my dose to see if it will (currently on 100mg) but yeah i get dry mouth a lot but its a good way for me to have to stick to my 8 glasses a day definitely worth the small side effect for the huge relief,1
i took it and ended up with a nonstop twitching and tingling in my legs it was horrible my doctor told me to stop immediately and now i take restless leg medicine when needed never had that issue prior to this medicine my mom took it and had no issues-worked great for her we all respond differently,1
im feeling the same way its been a long while since ive been this depressed my anxiety level is out of this world been on same meds now for bout 9yrs i know they arent working anymore so its time for a change i cant sleep maybe if i could it would help diagnosed bi- polar 22yrs ago and its been horrible at times over the years i feel so lost and alone right now i hope you get to feeling better i pray i do too,0
with me people just thought i was explosive when i was angry and that was just my personality my kids friends called me the witch from the mountains i now take three different meds but i have ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar but i am so much calmer and easier to get along with now,1
rest esp after childbirth v imp a good care plan i had epidural to reduce stress / pain and risk of relapse think that helped a lot  you need help with baby after delivery hospital should keep you in longer than normal and ask nurses to help at night or ur midwife can maybe medication is v imp after birth i tuk lithium and quetiapine to help relax that helped a lot sleep v imp but maybe ur diagnosis is different may need different meds but this helped me stay well ask someone to help with night feeds after and dont take on too much get help if you notice any symptoms,1
some manifestations of bipolar mania include high anxiety so the 3 can be very closely related; its also often the case that those diagnosed with bipolar end up with a dual diagnosis including anxiety and/or depression,1
doctors are so full of shit its unbelievable they cant even dispence the right medicine get away from those negative quacks u are a hell of a lot better and sarter than they are listen to your heart not your mind i know ive been there and i hate it when all those thoughts come into my mind i shake it off breath deep and think of positive stuff it helps a lot than shitty doctors,1
yes scary,0
i was hospitalized in may for the same reason ive dealt with the loneliness that comes with it unless you know someone who has struggled with it its really hard for others to relate problem is it adds to the emotional mudslide that plagues us i completely understand where you are coming from,0
i had 12 ect in 2012 and it worked but the side effects and memory loss is ridiculous i regret every treatment but my family directed the foctors to do it i had no choice my short term loss and long term loss are both screwed its horrible i cant remember my kids growing up i cant remember birthdays and little things that make meme i wouldnt do it if i were you i would try all medications before ect,0
it is now saturday 5:31 am i havent been able to sleep since thursday welcome to anxiety it will be fun they said! they lied can i return it?,1
im a little concerned about your dose of lamotrigine the max daily dose should only be 200 mg anything above that is not any more effective and may lead to a greater risk of developing adverse events,0
you broke the 1st rule of fight clubshame on you ,0
really difficult to enquire without putting on or seemingly to put him under pressure if in mania maybe wants to blot out all things associated with his depressive episode which unfortunately includes your kindnesses you could write expressing your wish to be there whatever but its his call and if it doesnt come you have to understand and respect that try to find out more about the psychology of sufferers a bit more but note we are all different there is no one catch-all description of behaviour everyone behaves differently however mind- boggling to may be to you,0
thats the main portion of my anxiety i used to love driving it was one of my favorite things to do and i insisted on being the one to drive any time my family or friends went somewhere with me the last year i was suddenly afflicted with severe driving anxiety to the point that i have anxiety attacks just thinking about driving my doctor put me on klonopin and gabapentin 3/day for anxiety but it doesnt really help my driving anxiety like you i cant take klonopin before driving as it makes me super sleepy :( i know this probably doesnt help you much sadly i dont have any real answers i just wanted you to know that you are not alone *hug*,0
when someone says something like that it makes me feel like i embarrass them im just trying to get a grip on it and accept it myself please dont make me feel worse and question myself even more,0
try to see if medication change helps ask ur doctor or if not helpful see another doctor check the side effects of ur meds when u feel up to it things will get better even if it doesnt seem like it dont worry try doing things u enjoy / little more each day/ stay away from stress/ stressful ppl/ try sumthing new if u feel ok with it take it slow and dont forget it will get better pray to god if u want bout what u want we all here for help and advice x,1
it took me 15 years to even start to come to grips with my illnesses (bi polar social anxiety disorder ptsd and agoraphobia)  for ur case i hope u can learn to cope and come to grips sooner rather than later u have a proven medical condition imbalance in ur brain and its nothing to be ashamed of i was ashamed for 15 years still am but i am making progress as for meds i just always accepted i will be medicated the rest of my life never really had to fight with it cuz i know what im like off them and its not pretty good luck,0
it has different effects for different people dont let some image scare you although abilify did not work for me so i had to switch meds,1
please be very careful suicidality and homicidality often coexist simultaneously in someone who is moving in and out of psychosis the threat of suicide can also be a manipulative technique to prevent you from fleeing for safety with your children that doesnt mean his threat of suicide is an empty threat but no one can begin healing with the fear of death lingering over head if your gut tells you to leave then leave i am not speaking in judgment but from extensive experience not just with myself but in almost every relationship in my family please follow your motherly instinct over your desire to be his wife,0
manicdepressed paranoia psychosis i hate all of it doctor visits therapists 1:1 partial hospitalizations hospitalizations med changes provider changes costs for treatment and meds loss of all relationships isolation weight changes insomnia nonfunctional wrong diagnosis dual diagnosesim on the damn good ship lollipop,1
wish you good health and peace  those were some distressing symptoms ,0
its been horrible i feel like ive had the worst ones,0
you have to be honest otherwise keeping it in will only make you worse by worrying about it,1
the key is routine all phones have alarms i used to use mine as a reminder i now have my routine and i never miss it takes 21 days to create new habits/ routines,1
yeah the guilt is horrible i mastubate at least 4 times a day if i can and im really guilty i just dont know why we get this feeling x,0
it all depends what is prescribed if you can handle whats going on stay natural but if it is thatn bad your life is getting interrupted i would worry about that and get fix more than sex,0
i love it until i get irritable if i didnt have kids i wouldnt be on meds,0
took me 6 hrs to get to the store today too and then i also had a panic attack while i was there nice to know im not alone,0
i agree with everyone everyone is different and responds differently to different meds it took me years to find what worked for me im bipolar 2 with anxiety and ptsd my psychiatrist has me on cymbalta geodon topamax and valium but everyone is different find what works for you and your symptoms,1
i too am a survivor of suicide attempts 2 in fact what gets me is whenever there is some "celebrity" that actually succumbs to the thoughts that many of us have known it gets horribly blown up in the media for those of us who have survived every time this happens there is a range of emotions that you experience you can talk to your therapist but somehow it just isnt enough what i am trying to do is start a suicide attempt survivor group that would be led either by a therapist or social worker i am trying to work out the details with the agency where i have my social worker both my therapist and my social worker thought it was a great idea there are groups for families who have lost a loved one but not for us i think it is time for one,0
i dont cut but i do self harm by scratching myself sometimes i dont realize it and sometimes i do ive drawn blood many times and then will pick the scabs my therapist and i are working on it but its really had to break the habit because when i have anxiety attacks ill break out in hives and itch really bad has anyone suggested alternate ways to focus your need to self harm?? i have yet to find something to distract myself,1
my daughter is bipolar and ive seen first hand what it is doing to her i also having a hard time dealing with her she worries me because she has a 10 mth old son cant live with her either  im sad been trying to get her help and right medicine sad momma here,0
neurontin works wonders for my anxiety though,1
while i dont personally ascribe to celestial intervention some people feel anxiety about events like this and it might be affecting you! do what makes you feel more comfortable or maybe watch the nasa stream and experience something cool take care of yourself,0
stop worrying about everyone else stop worrying about society and enjoy yourself  love life and breathe,0
my anxiety i feel like i should be doing something but i dont know what it is crawl under a rock i want to talk to someonei dont want to talk to anyone if i talk i will cry and it wont stop if i dont talk to anyone i will cry and it wont stop no one understands i dont understand it comes and goes with no warning help me i dont want to be here i want to be here but not like this,0
awwww its a horrid feeling ive been like it myself for a couple of weeks i wanted to be on my own tonight but my hubbie said we must have our friends round it did turn into a good nit and we all had a good laugh i feel much better now  sometimes we have to trust that our dear friends and family are there for us no matter what dont hide away think positive things before you sleep too xxx,0
your not! im down really low right now too because of my oldest kids they always like to get me upset and stress me out and my anxiety just goes crazy!,0
i wasnt upset just a bit confused as i said my apologies glad you have someone hanging out with you though :),0
if you feel like your throat is closing up you may want to see a doctor you could be having an allergic reaction i found out i am allergic to latuda and vistaril both of them make my throat close up and hyperventilate it feels like a panic attack but its not,0
i dread the future no reason to and i live my past over and over,0
im currently 7 weeks pregnant and i stopped taking my zoloft i am struggling with my depression but i am trying to work through it i dont want to cause my baby any damage,1
you could get a locking pull caddy that when its time it turns and sets off a loud alarm,0
hey its completely ok that you feel this way if you are in a relationship talk to your partner about your wants and needs in bed and talk to your counselor or dr if you are truly worried about it,0
lamictal and geodon geodon worked but the withdrawls were horrible and lasted forever,0
sometimes people over think things and they give themselves grief unnecessarily having a positive attitude and good outlook on things helps to lessen anxiety ,0
thoughts of death are a common theme with depressionevery day the thought of my own demise crosses my mindthey say live your life like its your last day but in reality the thought of dying scares the shit out of most people,0
it seems many different meds are being thrown out there to you for forthought with all their reactions/side-effects all over the place from person to person i do know every drug works different for each of us so i would think taking someone elses reactions to possible meds or even med combo can lead to trouble if you were see them as how you would or wouldnt react to them yourself i wanted to believe this reality many moons ago i have been diagnosed with this disease for 30+ years and have taken many different meds in many different combos remember a med can react one way with you and a whole other way with you depending on the other meds taken with it or just because your you for instance i have taken hydroxyzine with previous meds other than the ones im on now and tolerated it fully it helped but now if i was to well it floors me so tired you asked what others take for anxiety attacks i do take klonipin 1 mg for severe anxiety i take the dissolvable kind where they melt on my tongue and act instantly without this med i would be a basket case of anxiety as for me i dont linger away from docs directions for a second like taking one more or even not taking one at all this is dangerous staying within my guidelines i function normal i couldnt do gabatine and many others they just dont touch mejust know youre not alone but that not one of us is alike with the meds that work for them thus the reason these illnesses are so hard to get a hold of yet even cure good luck,1
i was in a similar situation and i let the cops arrest my mom even though it helped me it never changed her and made things very stressful on me if i had to do it over i would have just left dont let the negative effect you no matter the age take your life into your hands,0
buspar has been a godsent for my anxiety ativan only put me to sleep,1
i have an anxiety cube,0
i follow this page because my son has been diagnosed bipolar 1 i am also about to turn 50 i have 3 kids and one stepdaughter i have worked for a big corporate maritime services company for 10 years i still have no idea what i want to do or be i wonder when i will be a grown up i dont think this is just about being bipolar or depressed or anxious just part of life try not to look for a pigeonhole to put yourself into just try to be kind to yourself and do what feels right and gets you through the day ,0
true but it also gives you a chance to recreate yourself in a brand spanking new way a way that gives you a chance to be the person you could never be with out living through it it gives you the opportunity to map out your life as you want it to be had stuff but we are all so worth the work and struggle to beat this it is forever my friend but i chose how to live,0
i had similar withdrawals after stopping wellbutrin didnt dose down and had problems for about 7-10 days doubt that helps because all meds are different but i wish you well,1
well my wife is married to one (i suffer with depression anxiety and probably some other stuff) so id be hypocritical to say no,1
i am on that exact same dose and i have severe anxiety attacks when i dont take them,1
night terrors can be brought on by certain medications i get them sometimes and need to take a diazapam with my sleeping pill/mood stabilizer,1
oh yes i feel overwhelmed the minute i wake upall these what ifs and worries about the future start settling in and it takes me hours to pull myself out of it,1
how sad i was reading your postit was like listening to my son who had exactly the same symptoms as you are experiencing it took many years for him to finally find a professor of psychiatry who put him on the right meds and he is now coping much better dont give up on yourself there is always a solution! i just suffer from severe depression and anxiety but understand what you are going through sending you hugs and blessings from south africa!,1
that person is most likely a narcissist and would find a way to make you look guilty/bad regardless of your mental issues trust me on this #narcissismsucks,0
ya know i didnt even realize my anxiety meds might help me chill tf out rn lol thanks xd,1
my son has always been told adhd i always said that they were wrong he now has diagnosis of szioeffective mood disorder acute anxiety took many years but have the right set of therapists/psychs now and right combo of meds his psychosis is very stable moods are starting to stabalize but anxiety is sky high its a long road but keep going there is the right combo out there,1
im on it its been more than a month now and it seems to be working my anxiety levels have been reduced im also taking serotia for mood stabilization and depressionü,1
honey get out and distress your baby needs that,1
send him out to work that will take some of the stress if that does not (work) give him a few strong whiskeys that would do the trick ,1
i decided to be open about my bipolar disorder and some remain wary but i do not carei will not shrink from this i am not embarrassed and by being open i believe im making a small contribution to the understanding of it,1
it sounds so dreadfully hard for you at this time it also sounds as though you ve been going through this turmoil for such a long time i wish i had all the answers im wondering how long you have been seeing your therapist and if you feel seeing them is helping you also state you are taking medication but still feel as bad as this have you been taking them for a long time and does your therapist feel they are the right tablets and the right dose as you are still struggling so much? the only thing with trying to help and to feed back is the need to ask further questions only just to try to think of things which might help you talk about the feelings you have to your wife im wondering how long you have been together how supportive she is and i guess deep down how you feel about your relationship? can you remember the feelings you had when you first got together what attracted you can you recall some of those happy memories? thats a difficult one only you can really come to the conclusion how you really feel do you have any meaningful activities in your life? you didnt say whether you are able to work? with regards to considering why you cut yourself its hard to say as luckily i have never done that not that i didnt consider doing something and its probably hard to remember the exact thoughts before and while you were doing it i remember the thoughts when i considered it people have suggested probably already the main reasons people do it such as actually wanting to feel something as depression often makes you literally feel numb while at the same time your head can be in such a turmoil im wondering too if it can be the culmination of pent up anger resentment and frustration when you cant escape the desperate situation you are in when there seems nothing you can do to escape other than if you are lucky; sleep sometimes could this be a way of interrupting the cycle of over thinking and feeling dreadful? often i knew i wanted to escape i wasnt living merely existing whilst battling depression and anxiety day after day the desire to be somewhere else was immense but it always seemed so illusive when we crave contentment and peace the happy lives so many seem to have then occasionally death might seep into our thoughts as a better alternative to the sh*t we are always feeling i knew luckily that wasnt the answer and also i didnt want to not be here i just didnt want to be there i guess what im trying to say is we so desperately want all this pain to end and sometimes ending it all seems to only solution of course its not there is a better way recovery and a better life is the way the key but to reach that can seem such a monumental task to get there unfortunately can take a long time but it is possible and real but you do need people to help its necessary to lean on people and to let them help recovery relies on many things some very small but all important are there any other agencies you can access? charities? peer support? exercise is really good but small achievable and significant steps are key goals are helpful not huge goals small ones little steps exercise can literally begin with just sitting in the sun feeling the sun on your face trying once again to feel the sensations of the weather around you building up to perhaps a short walk and building up from there of course i dont want to patronise and teach you to suck eggs as they say over here but just trying to remember the things which helped me on the road to better mental health going back to the self harm im wondering sometimes it might also be wanting to actually feel something the illness and the drugs can leave you feeling nothing and inflicting pain on yourself will make you feel it might also divert your thoughts from the pain you feel inside your head to the actual physical pain? it is so hard to put into words what i thought when i considered it i felt as though i wanted to punish myself in some way that was payback for not being able to beat this hideous illness i think i felt a failure and weak in some way that the depression was winning and i wasnt strong enough to control it it was controlling me and why wasnt i able to fight this off and get better? also i hated being so self centred with depression i felt i spent all my days going over and over the past reliving awful things that had happened and just wallowing in self pity i hated it thats not me im not selfish but i couldnt stop it was self hard a way of hurting myself? did i deserve to be punished? of course i didnt but i couldnt see it at the time we can be so hard on ourselves mental illness is so hard when we have such conflicting emotions and having the strength to recover just alludes us when we need it most so sorry to run on so just trying to really think if there is anything which you might be able to relate to a healthy diet and trying to introduce things to give your life meaning are very important i know it can be hard when sometimes its not even possible to get out of bed but you have done so well in admitting things and getting help the desire to get better is the key there is a better way recovery and inner peace is possible but it takes time we must try so hard for ourselves we owe it to ourselves to beat this and to our loved ones best wishes always here x,0
been struggling the last few days i cant sleep :(,0
thank you for letting me know that im not alone  i dont know how to act i feel like im going backwards this is so scary for me  feels like im losing my grip,0

its never ok to give up even tho in that moment it can feel like youre doing a favor for your loved ones and finally achieving some kind of peace the reality of all of this is simple its just life and we have to live it and this is what our lives are sometimes a constant struggle to feel anything sometimes its a constant struggle to not feel too much or think of get it scream or whatever is going on there is someone that loves you and depends on you whether its your spouse children parents a friend or someone in this group that you have saved more than once giving up is not an option,0
our relationship was extremely toxic and ended horribly come to find outwe both needed hospitalization she is bpd and i ambi polar everyones relationship is different best wishes buddy,1

i have bad anxiety i take venflaxin and amitriptyline and i very rarely get chest pains anymore,1
i hear the misery you are feeling depression is the pits & makes us think bad things about ourselves so we definately need to be able to tell someone how awful we feel we want to be understood what we are fighting with inside at times a professional is our best port of call can you reach out to one person or service? please do this is tough stuff,0
i was started on 50mg but it aremy depression worse also very dry mouth with it horrible medication to take everyone is different though give it time to go into your system and see how u get on x,1

it took a lot of time to try to teach my boyfriend about bpd after my last stay in the hospital things have been getting better and we have begun to communicate in ways that are helping! there are struggles but we manage,1
hope your ok karen  its a horrible illness to suffer much love xxx,0
i stopped taking it found it too stressful trying to remember to take it,1
*note to admin* cannabis is not illegal in every state and most states have medical marijuana but if you wanted any honest opinion of mine cannabis is better for anxiety and ptsd just saying,0
oh i hate posts like this! damn pharmaceutical meds are killing people! please i beg of you do not harm your self and do not give up but do ween your self off the pharmaceuticals and start a regimen of sativa use find a nice cannabis sativa and try it it really does work it has changed my life! i was ready to pull the trigger so many time but i just could not leave my kids so i tried cannabis and found a real nice sativa strain that was a miracle cure i am now happy and productive my kids still fear the monster that was living in my brain but i have really turned my life around please i beg of youdo not give up!,1
i now understand that just because im feeling suicidal or planning my own demise doesnt mean i want to die suicidal ideation is a symptom of mental illness so just because you are dwelling on it doesnt mean youre going to act on it having said that depressed people do commit suicide so you need to have some strategies to help you through those thoughts seriously - if it were not for my kids i believe i would have opted out long ago they lost their dad to cancer as kids so i use that to remind me what it would do to them if i died by suicide im a christian so i keep reminding myself its not my job to decide how & when i die god has that sorted i have several close women friends i can call on if im feeling really dark two of them have experienced severe depression so get where im at when im this unwell i have an excellent psychiatrist who is only a phone call away if im feeling unsafe she will admit me into hospital until it passes or shes satisfied im safe to return home (i live alone) for some distraction helps i find this only helps if im well enough - have a list of things you can choose from that will distract you from your negative thoughts mindfulness - bring yourself back to now forget the past (too much rubbish) dont think ahead (too scary) light a candle play some [positive] music & just breath different things work better for different people hopefully there are some things amongst all these comments that might help blessings ,0
i have the same issue cant go on overnight trips or anything without severe anxiety,1
did not know that my experience was that it made me irrationally angry pretty much 100% of the time,0
when i was 25 i tried to kill myself and checked myself into the hospital found out i had bipolar 2 and had my meds changed i am almost exactly like this i take an add med anti-anxiety sleeping and a mood stabilizer sounds like you could benefit well from some meds! it doesnt get better without meds i had to stop my mood stabilizer to try to get pregnant and didnt realize how awful i was for the first couple years!! haha at this point my episodes could cost my family a lot of money and we dont need that!!,1
take your meds you need them you have way too many things going on in your life to be able to manage them without meds as for your boy friend he is the one who bears the brunt of your behavior when you dont take them i dont blame him my ex husband is borderline personality disorder and with just that life was a real struggle he refused meds were now divorced i couldnt continue when he wouldnt let the doctors help him,1
watching your child struggle with it for as long as you can rememberits the worst having it myselfi know the struggle all too well,0
my cousin suffers from depression and when her attacks begins she texts me and i rush to her house even her husband cant comfort her she told me i am all her hope (no pressure) and i can only understand her i am kind of ok with this part of story but when i feel really bad and sunk into darkness of my thoughts and depression and am gasping for a tiny comfort then anxiety hits mead i text her she replies a day after or so asking if i am ok! why i cant do the same? maybe i am not compassionate as i think i am maybe i am just a selfish idiot who feel better helping others and is using that to feel good and are pretending that is good person? oh my mind is so complicated and are always up and runing creating ideas and theories i feel like it is trying so hard to explain everything that most of the times is mistaken i am too tired of thinking but i cant make it stop! i have a secret that is killing me down and it is that i am homosexual and no one knowsi feel lonely and really in pain mental and physical i also have a nasty ibs that wont leave me alone sometimes i think my problems are too complicated to be solved 1 by 1 i need a solution that can help me to start with a clean new state,0
thank you vicki early 2015 i tried a paleo diet to see if it helped my mood & i had amazing results until i had several stressful life events all around the same time & i crashed big time & just didnt get well because i was so unwell i stopped cooking & eating nutrient dense foods & juzt got sicker as im getting my energy back im back into cooking & doing really well on a paleo type diet i truly believe what we eat plays a huge role in mental health #foodasmedicine,0
brenda anxiety is real and you are an insensitive fool,1
my son is the same i give him benadryl when its bad it works really well for anxiety and puts you to sleep his dr said its fine to use,1
wow rachel! it is good to listen to your doctors as the meds you were on might not have been ok while pregnant however to call the rest of us "dumb fucks" is out of line we all weighed the risk of our meds against the risk to the babys development there are meds your doctor could have switched you to that were safer telling someone to go unmedicated is like telling them it is ok to feel uncontrolled suicidal thoughts which puts them at a higher risk of death that it is never ok! we moms that took medication while pregnant and while nursing were putting our childs life first and ours to be able to be there for our child there are no "dumb fucks" here only educated moms,1
thats horrible i cant help but think youre better off for it thoughfor sure thats the kind of perpetuating ignorance i just dont understand,0
im not afraid to die in fact i wish for it every day,0
i have 2 children i was diagnosed at age 10 did not take meds while i was pregnant but life up until them was on and off my meds never was really under control my son bad been diagnosed with adhd i watch him closely afraid it was misdiagnosed and he actually is also bipolar my daughter is wonderful no mental illness so far i know that without my children i would not be where i today found decent been on meds three years straight now we are very open about our mental illness and our feelings they have watched me struggle at times but have been there and understand whats going on when i cycle i have made sure they are educated about it i do not regret having them but when i had them i never took into consideration they could also be diagnosed i was young and uneducated,1
my drs just told me 2 apply im bipolar 2 severe anxiety ocd and a ton of physical ailments 29 yrs young,1
ill ask a question to answer: do you notice any thought patterns activities times of day places you go where you notice your mood shifts dramatically? or is it more sporadic? i believe (do your own research) that the former is normal in people with bpd and features in bipolar ii not as familiar with ptsd yet but im starting my own research on that one however you would know yourself best and if this feels different or worries you that it feels worse than usual hit up your therapists & medical team for advice,0
resperidol is not an anxiety drug its an antipsychotic generally used in bipolar schizophrenia etc,1
ive gained 20lbs i absoutely hate it ive recently been going to the gym and trying to eat healthier sometimes i think i look okay im only 410 but then sometimes i can really see the weight its frusterating i know i need the medication to help with my anxiety and depression which it has but its difficult sometimes looking in the mirror,0
i took ambien and would wake up and do things i couldnt remember the next day it was really scary honestly i would take something different,1
im also bipolar anxiety disorder ptsd and panic attacks love to know who has what symptoms,1
black swan very disturbing,0
yes i had an odd fear of leaving my apartment and went a week without doing laundry i had a friend walk me down to the laundry room,0
this is normal with both 1 and 2 my dad got really bad at one point when he would think hes better and chopped my baby bed up into pieces while i was still in it i grow ul and have bipolar 1 and have a manic spending problem that left me bankrupt  you are not alone in this cycle if im off my meds for 72 hours i start freaking out and have panic attacks i would definitely see a new dr that you feel comfortable with and check your blood levels too bc these meds mess up your liver too,0
he obviously needs help and i hope he is willing to get it but at this point i dont think its your responsibility and you definitely shouldnt tolerate such terrifying abuse,1
i was diagnosed in 2015i was on lamictal for a while but stopped due to side effects have not taken any thing since  i have been monitoring myself what causes my triggers and i avoid as much as i can ive had some suicidal thoughts and sleep less night a few other stuff but i have been managing well enough i think i try hard to stay positive,1
i would talk to the gp and consider more therapy sometimes we just need a refresher on the techniques for helping ourselves i have no doubt that the job stressors are whats causing this relapse so just go talk through it with someone,1
i took it for migraines didnt work for me i ended up in the hospital with serotonin syndrome bc the side effects were so bad i ended up in the hospital i would call your doctor tomorrow and tell them whats going on it made my depression really bad to where i was crying and had bad thoughts my anxiety was so high i kept on having panic attacks,1
i know me too sometimes i will wake up out of a dead sleep n have a panic attack it sucks my heart will be beating out my chest its scary n i stay at home all the time because of my anxiety! i just want my life bk!! ,0
i have had depression and anxiety from about 12years oldalthough my depression has never been too severe at times it has defined me now i try to be in charge of it and quite a lot of the days kit works you can still have bad daysjust try to go with it as tomorrow really is another day you will get there seek all the help you can get from your gp and psychological therapies you will get to a better place all the best,1
you should be honest love keeping secrets only causes you stress and if they truly love you they will stay with you x,0
it was horrible for me i went off slowly and according to the doctors orders still withdrawals sucked,0
this didnt happen to me however a lot of my anxiety and depression came from wanting a baby and it never being "the right time" now that i have my little boy and am on anxiety meds i have never felt better! i have this incredible zest for life!!! i can understand his concerns and even though they hurt they are valid concerns that need to be addressed i hope your therapy session goes well - there are so so so many moms (and dads) who deal with mental illness every day and still totally rock this whole parenting thing!!!,0
i have a host of issues and on top of that i become suicidal at times more frequent than i used to be that said no i dont go to the hospital because im afraid of them and last time the police made me go to the hospitali spent the day on a stretcher in the main hall with everyone going by me and staring at the crying lady with deep cuts on her arms and wrists no phone no way of trying to calm myself down and refocusing my mind id rather die first before going back there i felt like a humiliated criminal for having a screwed up head,0
as a bipolar with anxiety and ptsd take your meds! talk to your doc if you want to cut some out or see if theres something out there that can take their place,1
your not alone❤ i have almost your exact diagnosisborderline anxiety n bipolar 1i struggle to take my meds correctly for fear ill get "toxicity" from the lithiumi work now but its a strugglehang in there hun and if you need to vent just a click awaystay strong❤❤❤,1
bobbi every person is different with different needs sometimes anxiety (and/or depression) can stop me from really doing anything for myself social anxiety may not want to leave the house so it can be helpful to have a support network of close friends etc to help out if it gets so bad,1
thank you all so much for the advice im getting ready to leave now scared nervous dont wanna go i am so nervous theyre gonna try to make mechange everything about myself,0
set up reminder alarms on your mobile youll never forget ever again works for me,1
stay away for the triggers that cause you to be overwhelmed,1
i agree with this - but i wonder why we feel so guilty or lazy- is it the need to please?,0
i dont doubt your grandfathers wise words its a matter of my anxiety making it difficult to believe that,1
i take 225 mg of venlafaxine daily for depression/anxiety and it has worked the best for me i also take it with riperidol which is a mood stabilizer i have never felt better but you also have to go to therapy while taking it it is not a miracle pill the two together is a great mix for me,1
its a struggle at times,0
i was prescribed seroquel with lamictal and had a horrible allergic reaction extremely high fever and broke out in a rash after reading these comments im thankful i had that reaction,0
music! thats always been something that i love so when i am getting all up in my head thats where i turn ive had a hard time for 3 years now with ptsd depression among other things this evil little thing can get into our minds and make us think we can do anything all we can do is isolate (which i do too btw) think about why and what is wrong with us we all have people who love us i have 2 little boys who need their mom more now than ever i had to be put on something to keep my mind from racing that is always my problem ive set with ear buds in my ears and told myself " you know courtney tomorrow just do 1 more thing different for your good and so thats what i have been doing for a year everyday do 1 thing different or the way i think i should do it and havent been or do something right do something to better anything in my life and it has helped im not gonna say im 100% better because im not i still have horrible days but ill tell you this and i do not like hearing it either and it makes me very mad but if a med doesnt work go to your doc and get another one i did that a year ago and had a nervous breakdown and it has been the darkest hole ive had to pull myself out of its been the worst maybe find a new doc or go to a homeopathic doc they are great just be careful about your meds and know that you arent alone all my prayers and thoughts for you you r not alone,0
everything you are feeling is normal for anxiety/depression sufferers at one time or another! do not feel like you are alone i am also someone that find writing it all down is easier for me to express myself and omg that therapist was a moron i struggle with therapists myself currently im seeing a life counsellor instead when you are feeling a bit better it may help you to help someone elsei find when im helping someone else im not fixating on myself and im able to move forward and it gives me purpose and gives me something to look forward too which is a must! ❤️ good luck for tomorrow at the worst youll get to get things out of your head!,0
hi rosalind you are not alone sweetheart im 29 i have severe anxiety panic disorder and its been 1 year since being out in public i only go to my doctor with my brother by my side and i have a specific taxi driver ive known for 6 years drive me there and straight home i have not been to a shopping centre a park a beach no where i wont even get the mail from the letter box i have no friends and no one knows i exist i hate when people walk past my house gives me anxiety i do not answer the door or phone i truly and completely know your situation darling and yes it gets to feeling like your a prisoner my heart hurts for you because i know how you feel so much :( xxxxxoooo i send you huge hugs,0
i set alarms on my phone and i use my pill box,1
generally: type 1: severe episodes of manic (at least one) and depressive episodes type 2: hypomanic episodes (at least one) and severe depressive episodes there are other types of bipolar disorder that no one talks about it like cyclothymic disorder is a mild version of bp2 with mild hypomanic and mild depressive episodes i have been diagnosed with cyclothymia although i feel im bp2 at times it feels like living on the edge it frustrates me sometimes i feel i just want depression to hit hard i lose it all but i cant it just makes my anxiety levels very high sometimes it feels im hanging in mid-air not sure when im going to fall and at the same time wishing i could fall and be done with it,0
feeling like you are bringing everyone and everything down regardless of thwir assurances that its not the case putting life on pause to find the right med combo and feeling guilty for that on top of it,0
yes and its horrible,0
i only have depression n anxiety havent been said what level but i am only on 120mg cymbalta,1
yup makes sense ive been under a lot of stress and anxiety the last few days plus the weather change affects my anxiety too i had panic disorder for over 10 years which progressed into gad im out of meds right now so maybe i will try some tea and a bath until i get more,1
i told my best friend this via text that i could t handle calls so please text or message me she then would text and as soon as i relied shed call needless to say we do t talk to each other anymore she couldnt respect me and my decision to not take calls due to anxiety and she couldnt understand why i wouldnt take her calls except to be rude sad,0
i feel this way all the time off and onthats the horrible reality of bipolar disorder did you take you medicine as directed? you shouldnt run out before the next refill if thats the case you need to be really careful about thatif not talk to your doctor about adjusting your prescription call them and tell them what has happened most of them are more than willing to help fill the gaps with your meds,1
i took it at the end of last year for depression and anxiety i found it made my anxiety worse for the first couple of weeks then it settled down i never shook the awful headaches it kept giving me after a few months so came off it everyone is different though so just track any changes and if you arent feeling better talk to your doctor about changing i hope it works for you though!,1
im so thankful that i have such an understanding family and fiance in my life i can be very rough to deal/ live with even my upper manic stages are scary im very blessed thanks for the support guys!,0
you look and you search for as long as it takes however horrible the journey and whatever you lose along the way it is imperative to your life that you undertake this mission killing yourself does not transcend pain in any way it means causing only more of it take a step towards people and they will take two towards you those who dont were never worth your time or your heart in the first place and they will be the most surprising people in your life after total honesty and disclosure only then do you know what your really have to work with in your life to carry on with,0
i get it sometimes i panic when my husband falls asleep even though hes right beside me cause then i feel alone again,0
horse shit! what you are going through is hell its not preparing you for anything horrible things happen not your fault hell doesnt need an outside motivation it is destructive on its own forces acting against you are not for your benefit not for your future its just painfilled hell but this too shall pass try to hang in there,0
i agree with tara except i avoided weight gain by changing what i ate and walked a lot,1
iv been there been on citalapram for years also got propananol for panic attacks i often wish i could have a heartache or something to get help its hard to get ppl to understand how it feels i struggle with feelings about selfharm and suicide when im low but there is another side i try my hardest to tell myself tomorrow could be better or the next day fight it take care of yourself even if you have to be selfish the medication might help but 4 wks is probably not going to be long enough to notice any improvement i also find writing things down gets it out you can read it later and see if you still feel the same or just bin it xxx,0
its strange how all my anxiety just disappears when i go high (i have bipolar btw if anybody reads this and thinks im on illicit drugs!!!),0
one more thing an important aspect of the article you condescendingly shared with me is that the author made the choice how to identify in fact quoting the author of the article you shared "ultimately the key is to ask whenever possible how a person chooses to identify rather than making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs" but thanks again maria for the pick-me-up comment a little piece of advice for you - you have no idea what my issues are and may want to re-think the way you interact with others online particularly in a bipolar/depression/anxiety open page,0
i would suggest seeing a therapist and a psychiatristi have intense depression and anxiety and bpd and autism and a few other things i feel like im all alone too  i just started with a new therapist cuz i moved to a new living environment in may or april and i just got a therapist in august  just two weeks ago  i have maybe two friends who understand my struggles but my parents dont get it at all they say its acting out or attention seeking  they tell me theres nothing wrong and i should not feel that way  some of my family say why cant i just be happy and they want a happy sister  they say dont sweat the small stuff  and its no big deal  they say im exaggerating they never have understood it  they thinks its bs  my family wants me to snap out of it to  im not on meds which makes it almost impossible to cope and livei feel like im definitely bout to lose it and go off the deep end i think i already have,0
feeling confussed and miserable,0
yepzero energy after i have these episodescant enjoy the good days fearing the bad ones anymore,0
yeah so idk about meds but i know i like taking ashwaghanda root for depression and valerian root as a sedative and a sleep aid also thc free cbd oil as well for anxiety,1
i dont know what i think of that we all want desperately to be understood,0
everyone  and everyones brain is different and what works for others may not work for you it will be trial and error recently after new clinical depressive episode i was put on sertraline by a new doctor and in two weeks i felt much much worse i went back and insisted on going back on to what had worked for me before  citalaprim now three weeks later by brain has stopped doing the negative stuff and rumenating and the anxiety has left me so try to describe to you doctor as accurately as you can your symptoms and the degree you experience them the meds are of course only part of the solution life changes and diet are far more beneficial although not discounting the role of meds in stabilising the worst vessels of brain/ emotional illness,1
no not alone i too have felt the guilt of my non-medicated self i have to stay on meds no skipping,0
i am having some major depression at the time  i want to sleep a lot and eat sweets and carbs i am struggling so much just to live from one day to the next hoping new meds will help,0
underlying factors “much of the decision to die is in the construing of events” says kay redfield jamison professor of psychiatry at the johns hopkins university school of medicine she adds: “most minds when healthy do not construe any event as devastating enough to warrant suicide” eve k mościcki of the us national institute of mental health notes that many factors—some of them underlying—work together to lead to suicidal behavior such underlying factors include mental and addictive disorders genetic makeup and brain chemistry let us consider some of them foremost among these factors are mental and addictive disorders such as depression bipolar mood disorders schizophrenia and alcohol or drug abuse research in both europe and the united states indicates that more than 90 percent of completed suicides are associated with such disorders in fact swedish researchers found that among men who were not diagnosed with any disorders of that kind the suicide rate was 83 per 100000 but among the depressed it jumped to 650 per 100000! and experts say that the factors leading to suicide are similar in eastern lands still even the combination of depression with triggering events does not make suicide inevitable professor jamison who once attempted suicide herself says: “people seem to be able to bear or tolerate depression as long as there is the belief that things will improve” however she has found that as the cumulative despair becomes unbearable the ability of the mental system to restrain suicidal impulses gradually weakens she likens the situation to the way that the brakes on a car are worn thin by constant stress it is vital to recognize such a trend because depression can be treated feelings of helplessness can be reversed when the underlying factors are dealt with people may react differently to the heartaches and stresses that often trigger suicide some think that one’s genetic makeup may constitute an underlying factor in many suicides true genes play a role in determining one’s temperament and studies reveal that some family lines have more incidents of suicide than others yet “a genetic predisposition to suicide by no means implies that suicide is inevitable” says jamison brain chemistry too can be an underlying factor in the brain billions of neurons communicate electrochemically at the branched-out ends of the nerve fibers there are small gaps called synapses across which neurotransmitters carry information chemically the level of one neurotransmitter serotonin may be involved in a person’s biological vulnerability to suicide the book inside the brain explains: “a low serotonin level    can dry up the wellsprings of life’s happiness withering a person’s interest in his existence and increasing the risk of depression and suicide” the fact is however that nobody is destined to commit suicide millions of people cope with heartaches and stresses it is the way the mind and the heart react to pressures that leads some to kill themselves not just the immediate triggering causes but the underlying factors must also be dealt with so then what can be done to create a more positive outlook that will regenerate a measure of zest for life?,1
i can relate and this memory issue is not uncommon perhaps you would do better to focus on storing those memories somewhere where they can no longer effect you or confuse you 20yrs is such a long time to be dealing with this maybe put all that negative energy that will juzt keep you sick into letting it go this enabled me to move forward & focus on my day to day health & well-being,0
what about ssdi? (or is it ssi? lol i cant remember)i dont know if i can help because i also have bad anxiety and depression as well as social phobia ptsd and other issues that i honestly cant even remember because my brain just wont work right however i did try starting a group on facebook and eventually all over the place for people who couldnt get the right help from doctorsor worse get abused by doctors because of our disabilities i just started it recently and i have a lot more work to do (and a ton of ideas) but i cant sit by and let this continue we deserve to be happy and healthy too! the only issue is that it is extremely difficult to form a group of people when thats my biggest fearbut thats also part of what motivates me ive been a prisoner to my own mind for way too long and ive let almost everyone take advantage of my brain not allowing me to say what i really mean or need to; like "no" or "i cant do that" sorry if this is too long i just really want to help not only you and anyone else but also myself i will try and find out more information if you want me to and im also still trying to get more people aware of the horrific health system so we can get some real help,1
i have had anxiety my entire adult life since my early 20s i am pretty much anti-meds myself and never take medication unless i really really need to when my anxiety level is high i need to take my anti-anxiety medication meditation and yoga and exercise is great im all for it but when i am in the throes of a panic attack they would not help me at all in fact i am fairly sure that would just make me more anxious what i need to do is take a pill and go somewhere where i can calm myself down period end of sentence,1
it may not be possible to completely stop anxiety but there are things you can do to manage it before it escalates there are excercises you can use i think they are part of cbt mindfulness where you work through a situation going through how you are perceiving it and what the reality if sutuation is its something that you have to continually work at you might always be anxious but there are ways to cope with it better,1
make a list!! its so helpful! and no worries on forgetting see them more than once!!!!,0
brenda speth balleza yeah cant tell you how many relationships it has strained because i dont know my anger is going nuclear unless someone points it out to me its actually the only warning i get that im starting an anxiety attack :(,0
shakir,0
the devil has nothing to do with your biology and psychology this is the kind of abusive rhetoric that made people fear epileptic people and condemn them instead of helping stay away from that church they are not rational,0
wish it was that easy but am finally feeling like myself again also starting to leave my house more since i got my dog i take her everywhere she helps with my anxiety,1
its not an okay thing its an act of desperation with mental illness i keep saying if it wasnt for my kids i wouldnt be here im still around for them so we continue to struggle to cope with all that were dealing with dailysadly some do end up going all the way and ending their life :/ is just part of the battle the struggle as mentioned but this is why we seek prof help be it medications/ therapy to try and have things be a little better,0
i have bipolar and anxiety 17 years and as of past 8 months anxiety has been super bad trying to find a new dr appointments can cause you to stress or upset you but in the end the only way youre going to get better is with help from a dr appointments arent always fun but they usually end up being painless and youll realize you got worked up over nothing,1
i would say get a dog from a rescue place my husband got one for me about five years ago after suffering from a life threatening sickness when made it through that i was alone most of the time other then my nurses but when i got marley he was like a god sent he would not leave my other then going out he was the best present my husband ever gave me i had something more to l focus on,0
they just prescribed me that and im scared to take any kind of medicine because they gave me prozac two weeks ago and it brought on my depression and suicidal thoughts so i had to stop it!,1
yeah the anxiety is alot worse for me due to the lack of sleep anger from not being able to sleep and all the other shit in that day thats just added to it,1
i have been where you are its horrible the only thing that helped me was staying busy as much as i didnt want to i forced myself to get out of bed everyday to get dressed and to go out even if it was only for a short walk it helped - sending healing thoughts your way ❤️,0
sometimes the soul is big and bright and the only way to satisfy it is locating its counterpoint and not forcing something that you know you dont feel because you will be miserable,0
all the evil dead movies are funny and scary,0
its never ok i attempted when i was 21 and im glad im still here even in my darkest hours i know im loved deeply by many people who would hurt horribly if i tried again or succeeded i watched my father-in-law and sister-in-law suffer so much when his partner took her life its still extremely tough for my sister-in-law who just turned 12 please seek help when your depression gets that bad it may be difficult but youll find the light again,0
panic!,0
im not sure what you mean by "sleep anxiety" but i have awful insomnia from anxiety and on the rare occasion i get some sleep i have woken up because of anxiety i wake up with awful chest pains and racing thoughts i would say anxiety can def wake you up also i know meds work different for everyone but personally wellbutrin gave me horrific anxiety so if your anxiety got worse after starting wellbutrin you might want to talk to your dr about that,1
before i became pregnant i went to see a reproductive toxicologist because i was on effexor and didnt want any adverse affects to the baby he said that ssris and ssnris cause no more damage than the 3% chance of any birth defect in a normal pregnancy my son had no withdrawal symptoms and received my breast milk for seven months that had my medication in it as well mood stabilizers like depakote can cause birth defects maois can cause birth defects as well as anti psychotics you should not worry about zoloft the doctor said to me that its important to have a healthy mother you need to be eating and sleeping being suicidal is not healthy for a pregnancy be safe and be well and may you have a healthy baby,1
you can use dissolvable klonipin can be used only as needed for panic attacks in the moment works wonders and youre not taking it all the time only when needed it works almost instantly when used,1
emdr helped me i can now think of the memories/events/triggers i have treated with emdr without feeling emotional which was a huge change still working on other things though and always still need meds i think it would be very very useful for ptsd if it works for you its not scary just feels a bitweird,0
i was in fluoxetine (prozac) for years and out of the blue had a reaction mood swingsself harm suicidal thoughtsanxietyshakes sweats i was told sertraline was not as harsh ive been on them four years the first week was hard as above i became depressed but now im even no ups or downs ive spent 2years training to be a counsellor passed level 2 and 3 counselling skills if i hadnt switched i dont know what would have happened,0
i get like this badly in the winter and mildly around my period its horrible,0
you are the first person i have everheard of besides myself with this fear you won`t know how the meds affect you till you try it did insert suggest take with food or on an empty stomach? can you ask dr or pharmasist for suggestions? do you have someone who can sit with you till you know it won`t do you that way? i wish i had more help instead of just questions it sucks i know but you can`t know till you try it maybe some music or a walk for distraction in stead of sitting around dreading it? idk but i feel ya,0

hey everyone! breaks my heart to know what people are going through its rough love to you all i used to take lamotrigine for three years but it didnt do much i now take a supplement regimen based on blood tests which isnt perfect but helps a lot! also making sure my diet has the full spectrum for all the nutrients i need i take zinc because i have too much copper in my system l-theanine for anxiety fish oil kelp for thyroid and a few other things i really recommend naturopathic remedies which i was skeptical of at first i have xanax and clonzepam for anxiety attacks but i try not to take those too much because they are addictive i have bipolar 1 and generalized anxiety disorder hope this helps everyone!,1

horrible it is i could really do with one now but i cant and im getting annoyed with my self,0
god has a plan for my anxiety? and what is that?? ,1
1 see a psychologist a lot can be achieved (and i was very cynical) through letting a stranger into your head psychologists are not medical doctors (although they can be also) as such but work on therapy by assisting with identifying issues patterns challenging ideas that you are set on etc you may need to see one or two different ones before you find one youre comfortable with 2 dont talk yourself or a doctor into a diagnosis bipolar is normal just an extreme version of normal where your ups and downs are more common and more severe dont think youre sicker than you are but if you actually are then dont worry because there are heaps of different options out there 3 drugs work different on different people some get benefits some dont some get side effects some dont i stopped counting at about a dozen different drugs ive been on over the years to find an improvement and then to fine tune it dont expect the first pill to be the silver bullet and dont be afraid to tell your doctor if youre not happy with something youre on try to document things as best you can eg felt super down no reason tonight sleeping patterns are off felt lethargic this morning im getting xyz side effects etc its hard to recall everything when youre right in front of your doctor 4 if you are bipolar then antidepressants are unlikely to fix your problem you will also need a mood stabilizer or anti psychotic (not necessarily for psychosis they can be used to bring mood peaks down and to improve sleep) 5 someone once told me "medication is the ladder correct diagnosis is the step toward it but you are responsible for climbing it" the translation here is that you will have to put in effort to identify and fix problems or if there are none (and honestly who has no oriblems!!) then look at positive changes in your life electronic devices off before bed (as i type this its 231am in australia - oops) force yourself to go to bed at a reasonable time force yourself to rest even if you cant fall asleep - try not to get wound up about not sleeping and just enjoy the chillout) force yourself to get up at a reasonable hour incorporate some exercise into your day (an early morning walk is a great way to get yourself out of bed early to feel good straight away and to have achieved something before youve even started what would be your normal day 6 watch your diet sugars stimulants (coffee) high calorie and high-gi foods lend themselves to buzz and crash scenarios 7  the g in gp is for general it means they have more knowledge than the average population on most medical topics but no specialist knowledge you should see a specialist in the case of this illness that would be a psychiatrist dont be ashamed its normal people get sick its an illness youre not crazy or faulty 8 share find some friends you can talk to about it i guarantee theres practically no-one you see or work with that would say no if you said you werent doing well and would like a chat 9 dont get caught in the this is me trap yes your illness is closely linked to your personality and something you cant change but that doesnt mean you have to spend all your time on depression sites or reading/sharing depressive memes i find that makes the situation worse n- you feel at first like its good that soneone relates to you but on the whole youre just surrounding yourself with negativity focus on positive things positive changes and youll not only get better but youll actually be better than many normal people because you will learn a lot about yourself other people and tools for everyday life,0
it is more noble to live with your own agony than to transfer it to those that you love it is horrible to say but i am used to the agony i live with everyday so i am better resourced to cope with it due to sheer experience with my own emotion to end my life would take my agony and force it into the lives of those i love and that simply isnt something i am willing to do i can deal with the constant questions whirling around in the dark vortex of despair in my brain but if i were to stop that happening? my mum my girlfriend my friends my colleagues would all be thinking endless thoughts "why didnt we notice it sooner?" "why didnt he trust us enough to talk about how he felt?" "how could we have helped him?" and that kind of rumination is something i wouldnt wish upon my very worst of enemies x,0
i take seroquel and viibryd prescribed by a psychiatrist seroquel is a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic viibryd is an antidepressant my depressions are debilitating i feel both meds have helped me a lot but i still have problems dealing with stress i take klonopin as needed i just stay home a lot i cant deal with people i also see a talk therapist i feel it helps a lot too,1
you need to see a new doctor i have bipolar and struggled really bad but am coping with appropriate meds and extra support definitely seek medical help urgently because sometimes thoughts and what others think are just threats can turn into suicide without any hesitation as horrible as it sounds some people find that its their only chance of being free from it all ive lost 4 friends from suicide and none of them even showed symptoms of depression it is a very well hidden illness that can be treated to be manageable xxxx,0
yeah i had a look last night such a shame when so many people would benefit greatly from it,0
wellbutrin was the first antidepressant to work for me so i love it just be careful of some of the side effects it can cause sleep disruption anxiety weightloss then weight gain,1
you might try klonopin instead of valium it last longer might help you make it through the night and i have so much anxiety and then youll feel a little more refreshed,1
theres hope i have bipolar borderline personality and anxiety as well as thyroid disease and hypoglycemia and ive been in a relationship 16 years now never split up believe me im a roller coaster to live with and hes a saint for dealing with it but we stay together and weve both only kissed another person once and we talked it over and neither of us have been unfaithful since,0
agree and i think that is why some of us worry so some things are simply out of our human control!,0
im sorry im giving up on myself and my life im sorry suicide is my only option left  im sorry im struggling sorry for being a worthless failure  sorry that i am going to leave you so soon sorry i have no more reasons to live,0
its a hole that seems to get deeper each day you fear experiencing happiness even for just a moment because it wont last or something bad will happen nothing good ever lasts,0
nadine believe me i know its a shock to hear from a doctor that one is bi polar yes it was for me as well i was told this when i was 18years old im now a young 51 but you got to accept the fact otherwise you will be in the same place honestly i as well as millions of other people with bi polar had to face this at one stage or another i know its hard but when you learn to accept you can move on with your life honestlyi not only have bi polar i have stress anxiety a bit of ocd and virtiligo but hey life can throw all sorts at us sweetheart but its up to us to face it head on and say ok this is how im going to look at this and apply myself please have faith and believe and know you are not the only one on this rollercoaster as i see it wow have i had many rides think positive nadine be strong ,0
is it like a physical anxiety? jittery in legs or both legs and arms? may be youre suffering from the side effects of restless leg syndrome or akathesia call the doc right away,1

being bipolar and having bipolar disorder is two different things everyones case is different there was a point i legitimately couldnt work for eight months trying to find the right mess struggling with bad side effects or having bad episodes in the middle of work i never got help from the government but thats each persons decision to make when i got better it wasnt just easy to get back into the swing of things because of my "personality" its always hard keeping a job people dont appeal to my personality no i couldnt snap out of it to take care of myself my family helped me if i didnt have my family it couldve gone a lot worse and not everyone has a support system,1
i take lamictal and topirimate for depression and bipolar i just stopped latuda because the lamactil is doing great but latuda was amazing for the last three years hydroxyzine for anxiety ambian for insomnia,1
lesson number one never tell employer your mental illness they will capitalize on it  like they did mocking your illness by saying its too stressful trust me  let them know your doctor gave you time off for medical reasons but thats it,0
ive been on almost every drug there is since i was diagnosed in 2005 i felt hopeless in finding something tht would work but ten years ago i was prescribed seroquel and citalopram and to be honest with u i would recommend it to anyone i dont want ppl to go through wat i went through so plz give it a try tell ur doctor to start you off on 100 mg of seroquel and 10 mg of citalopram than progressively move up i have anxiety at night so i take both of these at night and i wake up fully refreshed! dnt be discouraged if you get real sleepy with them at first it takes a little while for your body to adjust to them,1
i was on this medicine for years and it never got any better i was on 600 mg twice a day on top of xanex 4 times a day and ambian at night when my diagnosis was changed to bpd from bipolar along with sever depression ptsd sever anxiety disorder & panic disorder i have been on different meds for bpd the withdrawal from lamotrigine are tough so if you do decide to change meds make sure to decrease slowly,1
my sons clinic is no longer giving out benzos and brought in an addiction specialist my son occasionally takes valium but another son of mine got addicted taking 3 a day for many many years and it made his anxiety worse he got off of it through his therapist i think it is okay to use them but not for years at a time and not so many a day,1
nope you arent wrong i have all these and find people who will listen we all deal with some kind of anxiety etc,1
may not be bipolar at all he could have paranoid schizophrenia you may not be able to easily convince him to visit a doctor he may start assuming you are part of the "conspiracy" thats against him and fight against it your sister-in-law may have to try to get him commited to a hospital in order to get him any help if there are moments of lucidity in his thinking/behavior (where hes less ill and more compliant) you may be able to talk him into going to see the doctor however if you do dont wait to do it take him immediately when he is willing to go he may cycle back into psychosis quicker than you expect in case you dont know a person in full-blown psychosis can become violent or dangerous if they feel threatened be careful how you handle him my best wishes are with you,1
you can have them in 25mg for daytimethats what i usebut cannabis is way better for anxietyreally kills it for melife changerbit heavy to be on seroquell 24/7,1
be careful with st johns wort one side effect is agitation/anxiety i learned that the hard way,0
im on busiprone 60mg and do pretty good but it still shoots up suddenly but this med has helped me more than any other wow dont ever go off your meds even on meds youre gonna have anxiety so i just learn to live with it but the physical symptoms of it are hard to deal with the hunger the foot in your gutstuff like that good luck,0
i think most do however it gives me anxiety and i dont for the most part i have recurrent depression which is even more awful but with the meds im on i tolerate it and im well if i do the work to stay that way,1
alarm clock got wood?,1
if yur scared and have no one best plc is the hospital as yull get all the help yu need as i took a really bad break down and had no one to speak to and i was acting crazy and didnt sleep for 12 days straight so i ended up getting sectioned and it was the best thing that could have happened am not saying am completely cured but i dont see and hear things but am still not a great sleeper so i still attend hospital and get medication please go seek help x,1
its good that you are seeking help those memories/ flashbacks/feelings are not easy to talk about you might try lining up some trusted friends/family to help you if you feel uneasy usually its a week or so until the next appointment make a plan call someone to come sit with you talk to you on the phoneonce youve settled in to "how it works" it should get a little better if you get on youtube and searchwhat to do after a therapy session it should give you some mental health tipsonly look at the ones with licensed therapists or professionals,0
do you know if it is required to see the psychiatrist or psycologist once a month? i see my psychiatrist once every 12 weeks for med checks (because of my insurance) but i see my therapist once to twice a month depending on the time of year and some times as often as weekly (i was denied once and got anxious about seeing a judge so i am about to apply again),1
i suggest vipasanna meditation also known as mindfulness meditation for the reduction of anxiousness look up some scientific papers on the subject it works for me,1
i have anxiety depression and ptsd i can no longer drive and can barely be a passenger its awful,1
i have the same struggles its impossible to function without sleep,0
omg! i miss me more than anything else that ive lost through all of my struggles,0
i should read all the comments 1st im sure there is some very good advice postedbut i would be very tempted to call/text/fb my sister & thank her for all she is doing to help take care of your father & let her know what a struggle youve had & how thankful you are that she has taken on the responsibility of his care & also mention any other siblings who should be able to help her as well,1
i struggle with bipolar everyday i was diagnosed when i was 9 its hard at times especially when youre in a despesive state ive learned my own coping methods like if i want to say something rude i think of my favorite song or i take a deep breaths ive also noticed if i have something in my hand all the time like a stone or anything small i will rub it constintally and it helps a lot to keep me calm and focused,0
im on 60mg of that great stuff nailed my stress and anxiety problems does make me drowsy tho but worth it,1
that used to happen to me alot then it stopped dont know whytalk to a dr about it maybe it has something to do with anxiety,1
im going to try and get him to meet with me as well we im south africa if u not on health insurance the waiting list to see any doc is so long im afraid it might be too late i myself am bipolar and attempted suicide for times the fourth i pray was my last,0
i just started it two weeks ago i also take prozac and geodon i have bp 2 so far it makes me feel like im in a fog i have a hard time waking up several nights ive confused dreams with reality and vice versa ive not been bothered enough by the side effects to stop taking it,0
i agree with the otherssounds like you need emergency intervention  dont be afraid of going to hosp they will help you get stabilized and can refer you to a psychiatrist for regular mental health check ups there is a facebook group called life inside a bipolar mind you can vent and share in group online and someone will understand also google nami they have in person support groups and family education groups as well also you can look at dbsa most importantly do not stop reaching out for helpif you try one avenue and it doesnt work for you keep talking to people until you find some help you can also call 211 and they can let you know about resources in your area there is also a suicide prevention life line 1- 800-273-8255 or look online at: suicide preventionlifelineorg ((((hugs)))),1
and that shit is so confusing and racing around in your head and 1000 miles an hour and you cant get your words out because its just too much going on sometimes its best to stay silent as you say,0
bipolar is not easy deal with which one struggle everyday!,0
feel like dog shit today irritable fed up sick & tired but still went to work stayed all day went grocery shopping now football practice for the teen gonna make myself walk during his practice started a scuttle with the spouse earlier today now getting silence just want to hide in bed could use prayers thanks,0
if hes threatening to kill himself the threat should be taken seriously if hes got a therapist that person should be notified (at the least) if hes on medication it may be failing and something new may be needed at the worst he may need to be hospitalized again which (im sure) is not something either of them want to hear if hes a danger to himself his health and welfare is more important than anything else the poster may want to help their boyfriend but the truth is that they likely dont have the necessary skill set to do it and are too close to the problems an informed professional might be able to give him a better perspective on things the boyfriend needs to be talking to a therapist or needs to be in the hospital right now if hes gotten this bad thats the only advice i have sadly :(,1
thats horrible!!! i hate that we have to live with so much judgement even those that are trying to get attention need attention need help and theyre in danger of things going too far i hate it,0
my advice would be as a person with bp 1 that if ever you dont know what to do to help her? simply ask if all else fails tell her she is never alone because youll be there however due to experience with dating and moving fast maybe slow down sometimes in the past when people said it fast id believe them and bc of mania id have grandiose unrealistic expectations from them and get wicked upset if they dont live up to them! it has caused a ton of fights with past partners i have grown a lot since then but since you are new to it keep educating yourself (you get major points for that!) but overall dont give up and if you ever have to? explain why have a set reason or issue you would have to leave over (ex cheating is a deal breaker for many people etc) make sure she knows and understands that i love that youre asking for advice here it shows you care deeply i wish you luck and thanks for proving not all people suck and are afraid to love someone with a mental illness as it is literally that way for many people with mental health issues we deserve love too and a-holes make us forget that sorry for rambling i hope this is helpful!,0
dont agree with this i went back to school at 50 which was scary but took it a day at a time & i graduated your best is good enough!!!!,0
im on 1200 mg lithium for mania and 150 mg trazodone for sleep/antidepressant daily and lorazepam (name brand ativan) as needed for anxiety everybody is different what works for one wont always work for another also depends which end of the spectrum you fall into as to which combination of drugs will work be patient tell your doctor whats happening as you get it sorted out side effects will vary as well whatever you do dont stop taking meds once youre on them without talking to your doctor first it could make the situation worse good luck to you hope this helps,1
i wna talk but im embarrassed and i dont think that people wna hear my story cos everybody got their own problems,0
this is the last page i wanted to see this meme attached too omg the admin needs a smack since harly quin was added to the dc universe she has been shown to be abused manipulated beaten threatened and at one point in the animated series smashed out of a window 4 stories up to the point she had to be wheeled into arkham in a wheelchair all by her "puddin" joker she have intense stockholm syndrome,0
there is know way to describe the terror you feel when your having a full blown panic attack unless youve had one,0
im here im glad to talk whenever you need someone i have anxiety and bipolar 1,1
i think it sounds like you had a sleep paralysis side effect and then you had an anxiety attack because of it when you are panicking you can experience lots of weird sounds feelings and ideas,1
i have severe anxiety while driving i have taken severe panic attacks in the middle of big highways i have learned when i can and cannot drive because of anxiety i use to take lorazapam for anxiety and would take it about 30 minutes before leaving the home it helped greatly and never felt that i was under the influence or drugged in any way i felt like any other person driving on the road then i got pregnant and i decided to try to not use any meds for as long as the anxiety would let me it has been about 2 years or so now anyways i deff think there are certain meds that can help you that are okay to drive while taking them as long as you are use to them and know how it will affect you,1
im really back and forth either i cant sleep at all or i sleep through like 10 alarms im currently not taking anything for sleep but have been on effexor and welbutrin for years,1
my daughter is on propranol she is at university she has been complaining off chest pain and numbness and irregular heartbeat i worry in case its not the tablets as she was a premature baby she wont go to the doctors it was hard enough getting her to go about her low mood and anxietyand to be honest it really has not helped her i hope you feel better soon big hugs x x x,1
my job is just crazy you basically do 5 jobs in one and we put peoples lives on the line so we have to be 100% on our game its just really hard for my brain to bounce from position to position in the same day i feel like i cant keep up and then i get anxious and start talking crap and saying things i dont really mean im just saying them to try to calm down,0
someone whos never been there will never empathize let alone be compassionate about your case (unless they have the kind of golden heart that allows them to -somewhat- sympathize with you) it might be hard at first but you should distance yourself from anything or anyone that makes you feel angry sad or guilty these 3 emotions at higher degrees are the gateway to depression you need to find people that have been there and overcame it or learned to cope interacting with others even online in a fb group is a good start id say :) also this :,0
took it for one month made me very shakey and dizzy,1
i use a mirena the estrogen in most birth controls sends me into wild mood swings mirena is progesterone and my body handles it better i have ptsd anxiety major depression and they are tracking my moods to determine bipolar i hope this helps,1
this has been me for too many years to count at least i now know about thyroid and adrenal issues that contibute to the endless anxietyi feel for all of you who suffer also,1
i think it will only b natural to be at least a little bit scared i know i was it is just getting used to the outside world again it will take time but it will fade if it gets too much u can always reach out to the local crisis team for help dont b scared to do that also remember it can only get better ur not alone x x,1
i never want to relapse but i often struggle with the hospital or home i pretty much always want to die,0
i have bp 2 and it is often missed and diagnosed as depression anxiety because most people seek help during depressive phases and these can be more obvious the hypomania a person can come across as be really energetic or irritable and anxious agitated fixated or obssessed with something and then lasts for a few weeks it generally doesnt involve losing touch with reality or lack of insight / self awareness as with mania the cycling between hypomania and depression is generally more frequent in bp2 and can be just as difficult to manage because of this frequent mood changes in fact to be diagnosed with bp1 a person only ever has to have 1 episode of mania and sometimes they never have another one,0
you are not alone i have exactly the feelings you describe every day my family thinks i can just let it go and get over it too let us on this site help you navigate the storm i have received a lot of support and understanding on here the belief that feelings like yours and mental illnesses​ are results of chemical imbalances in the brain has been understood for a while the challenge is to get the right meds to restore the proper balance of seratonin (the main happy feeling substance for the brain)  i also take effexor and works for me but everyone is different try to have patience because finding the right meds for you can take a while some meds can take 4 weeks to get to theraputic levels and help my racing thoughts are from anxiety and it sounds like yours are too take some time to research symptoms of anxiety and i think you will find they describe those racing thoughts and worries you describe the most helpful medication i take is busparone it has done wonders for relieving my racing thoughts and worries about everything thats what is specifically for i take 30 mg in the morning and at night but started at 15mg anxiety has lots of faces look it up in several places i had no idea what i was experiencing was anxiety let your doc know your symptoms tell him " i think i am having a lot of anxiety because" there are several benzodiazapines ( like klonopin) that some prescribe but beware of them because they are addictive and coming off them is no fun busparone has been my savior you need to have a doc that listens look up depression and anxiety and see how they relate to each other best advice i can give know yourself! take control of your own recovery!! ,1
its not uncommon for medications to stop working as effectively over time your body becomes habituated to the meds and you need something else to help control symptoms you may also be under more stress in your life than you realize right now stress definitely can have an effect on how well your medications work talk to your doctor sounds to me that your anxiety is whats not being controlled as well right now your doctor may be able to give you something else for your anxiety that might work better for you right now anxiety definitely can result in irritability my husband is that wayif he gets anxious he can get irritable and aggressively grumpy please explain to your family and friends that you definitely dont mean it you love them and youre sorry if you hurt them you need your medications adjusted if you explain and apologize they may be willing to let it all go and you may need to find another jobsomething that is a better fit for you personally and that doesnt cause you to feel paralyzing fear my best wishes are with you,1
please find a new doctor who will address your liver failure that is scary do not let that go on,1

oh my your pain comes through it is awful to hear the struggle you are experiencing it is clearly a half life you are living well not really living but merely existing if nothing now brings you pleasure unfortunately it sounds very familiar but it might not be any comfort to you that the feelings you are experiencing will resonate with so many people when you are going though such turmoil each day can be a nightmare day after day it is exhausting debilitating and so dreadfully unbearable no wonder you have had these thoughts that you cant go on you dont want to be here and just cant see anything ever improving its a viscous cycle of ruminating feeling alone abandoned desperate constantly miserable and not being able to see an end to it all when you need the strength drive and determination to beat this hideous illness those are the things which you often dont have please please dont give up hope your family need you and want you you expressed that your friends dont understand but you havent really totally opened up to your family? is this not something you could do to try to explain how bad things really are? it is very often the case we push our families away for many reasons but can they truly help and support if they dont really know? re the diagnosis medical appointments and medication the recent diagnosis is only the beginning with regards to those issues is there no ongoing support from those? im no expert but diagnosis in itself is surely of little help if there is nothing provided on the back of that? forgive me as i assume you might be in the us and im in the uk and clearly services are very different but diagnosis alone could make things worse in the short term without the follow up support as it might just leave you with so many unanswered questions? again re the medical apps and medication this all can be instrumental in providing a stable platform to build recovery if the meds arent right then it can be so much more difficult i often view medication as a necessary (in many cases) crutch to provide the stability to move forward you explained these appointments are expensive but what is the potential cost to you your family and your daughter if they are not working? once the medication is right the appointments then can hopefully lessen i really understand your pain having suffered previously for so long but i also know unfortunately the pain and carnage a suicide leaves behind when you are in the middle of the quagmire of severe depression we dont always rationally view everything so much can get obscured and we can make some terrible decisions my psychiatrist warned me against making any big decisions while i was suffering as we view the world very differently i put no more thought into buying a house than a loaf of bread nothing had any meaning it is so hard to see the wood for the trees (apologies for my english metaphors!) ive seen both sides i guess i know all too well the effect a suicide has on those close loved ones for a lifetime your parents and your daughter of course dont want to have to live with that im sure they all love you very much and would want to do all they could to help if they really could understand your pain im so sorry to run on and i also know it is far from easy but in short in the grand scheme of things i guess the cost of the appointments and the potential happy life you could have is worth the money there is a real chance of having a better future a chance to be happy post depression for me is the start of my new life my depression (well the last big one) was my previous life small achievable steps are possible but you need support and love care compassion be kind to yourself you deserve to beat this you all deserve a better life best wishes thinking of you x,0
im guilty,0
and sometimes anxiety hyphens anger so some people can still kick ass even if theyre feeling down and out lol,0

youll be surprise that people will except you and every time i meet somebody they cant believe my life or my mental illness im very open about it and i do tell people i go to therapy i will probably go to therapy for the rest of my life and i dont and i dont care if anybody knows or if somebody does not want to be my friend because of it but thats just my personality i come through so much that im not going to apologize for my past that has shaped me into the person that i am so whatever you need to do to help yourself thats the path you should take but taking your life will never be the answer take it from somebody that tempted it three timesthe more people i talk to more people are open with me and i find out a lot of people are struggling with depression and mental illness trust me youre not alone we like to hide behind shadows thinking that we have perfected a reflection of happiness with in ourselves but if you open up and you let people and you will see that everybody struggling in a different way and that you are not alone but i wish that you will read this before you decide to do anything and you will consider to give life a second chance and give your parents a chance to help youmuch love i will be praying for you that you will be able to get through this hard time (from )marisol your new friend,0
i take 1200 mg twice daily for severe anxiety i have not had to use an anti-anxiety med in years!,1
zoloft made me so manic that i had a major panic episode that convinced me i was having a heart attack my limbs went numb etc but after the first week or two it was fine getting used to it is hard apparently so is withdrawal when you stop,1
seriously i have always thought my ability to think reasonably clearly in very chaotic and stressful environments was a very minor superpower i thought it was due to being brought up by doctors and nurses but this suggests my neurodiversity might be part of the reason (recent add diagnosis added to anxiety and depression),1
i also have that its all pary of anxiety i got that feeling for 3 days in a row and it ended up in a panic attack in a restaurant i didnt even knew at the time what a panic attack was like i was taken to emergencies and that was what they discovered it works for me to go lie down even if i get that slightest feeling for 10 min and relax each muscle and mind hope it works for u,1
anxiety absolutely sucks and when it takes over you can feel helpless i have depression/anxiety and bpd i personally found medication to not help but its about what works for you i like to take a bath to calm myself or try turn my anxiety into something useful by keeping busy be it cleaning getting out and taking the dog for a walk or playing with my daughter i have a few close friends who know and it helps to have their support and understanding try focus on the positives and remember that as hard as it may seem you can overcome it you will always have your bad days your human be easy on yourself its all a process,1
ask for sertraline taken in the morning it keeps u on track in the day and its effects stil help u sleep in the evening i do not have bipolar i have suffered from differing degrees of depression and anxiety son and of since i was 15 and am in a good place now with this medicine i will be 60 this year i hope they finally find themedicaton that will help you ,1
exactly im on a disability support pension and cant afford private health insurance because of that im always at the bottom of them pile just getting the disability pension was the hardest and most stressful fight in my life and ive had a rare life already!,0
ill admit i slept with like 11 people in a year  not good now its a struggle bc my fiancée isnt too sexual so sorry no advice but i feel ya,0
you dont know me but somehow i ended up here ditto to your story i lived a lifetime of struggling and trying to figure out whats wrong with me then someone sent me this and i realized that if one single person would take the time to send me this then im going to survive the mess is them because unless they live it they will never know it were going to be ok for us because we have to be! liliana,0
i stopped my meds as soon as i found out i was pregnant but was contiously advised by psychiatrist and consultant to go back on mirtazapine i managed to stay off them until i was 22 weeks but i had to go back on them started at 15mg and built up to 45mg i really think i would have been in a really bad way post natal if i hadnt started back on them i was assured first trimester was the riskiest for meds xx,1
that effexor is horrible stuffif youre feeling like that th medicine isnt working turned me into a unfeeling zombie i got off it a d suffered brain shocks for a week,0
if ur bipolarnot a good med imo my daughter was recently prescribed it and she went into psychosisit was awful at just 25mgsshe had horrible withdrawals from zoloft too which surprised me because she was only on it for 2 weeks at the lowest dose,0
agreed one really does have to pull oneself together for ones children however hard it is though i think the best parts are when you surprise yourself by doing what needs to be done regardless of your own anxiety or whatever one gets to sit back at the end of the day and say ha! i did it and pat oneself on the back it proves to oneself that one really can do it in spite of everything the guy sounds great you really should work for him he sounds worth the effort,0
yes reality is very scary to me,0
i agree take the meds i tried without and believe me it does not work i was very stubborn and it took quite a few years to realise my stupidity you are a better mam if youre a relaxed mam i ended up being a single mam after my husband left us my son was 6 i used to plan stuff to do all the time so he was never bored and we had a great time together made some very good memories by making plans it makes you get on with it its very difficult to pull yourself together and do it but by planning it gives you time to psych yourself up i didnt want to let my son down and thats what kept me going and believe me meds give you the crutch to help there is no shame in needing help so give it some thought and try to go for it x,1
i refuse to get started on therapy to lose it suddenly its a real threat to not have the coverage! there are ways to manage,0
zoloft gabapentin and xanax ptsd and bipolar 2 gabapentin made me forgetful so they put me on lamictal but if i hadnt been so air headed i would have stayed on it since for me the combo was amazing for the anxiety and mood swings,1
i take cymbalta right now 90mg and abilify 5mg all the other antidepressants either didnt work or made me sickim major deppressiongeneral anxietybi polar and fibromyalgia so far thats what i have,1
very brave to raise this symptom and for everyone who has posted comments of support its a very real and sometimes very destructive symptom of bipolar and there should be no shame discussing it to everyone here that has shared their experience off it i completely understand and relate to all those who are appalled by the subject and felt the need to comment negatively why not just scroll past if its not relevant to you some of us already feel bad enough for having symptoms we cant control your disgust in the subject is dangerous to those struggling to understand x x,0
propananol really help with anxiety for me they calm me as for pip ha ha im able to wash so they dont care bout anything else im lost in my sad little life the system is a disgrace im 49 honey been dealing with this all my life and fighting for helpwaste of time x,0
i honest would get upset cuz i would feel like there downplaying my issues and not taking it serious and acting like my mental health is a bad thing,0
i have bipolar disorder the first several months were really good but it gradually made me more and more anxious to a point i could barely function i think its good for a lot of people but its also known to throw you into a mania and increase anxiety,1
ugh see i tried celexa for 2 months then after a month once it kicked in good it made me extremely unhealthy depressed like horrible but the month was great i finally stopped taking it when i realized why but im super happy yall found something that helps its so hard ,1
call - get appointment - talk freely with dr so he can know how to treat you - no need to worryjust do it - you will be so glad went besideseveryone needs help from time to time everyone! (some just refuse to admit it) been bi-polar since 92have learned many coping skills & you will too god bless you!,0
vistaril didnt help me just gave me shaking fits,1
that would just make my anxiety worse i hate any type of restrainment,1
has had the opposite effect on me ive been struggling to sleep and loss of appetite,0
i had the bad rash reaction to lamictal which made me sad because within 2 weeks i was feeling more stable and happier i tried geodon but it not only did nothing for my moods it flared up acute pancreatitis so i am back to taking only xanax to manage my anxiety and also helps curb my hypomania a bit,1
beetlejuice does not count as horror in my opinion; its more of a comedy and it is fantastic!!! ,0
i have an alarm set for my meds i get them all ready for the next day the night before,1
i began to notice this after my last depressive episode but i also noticed its been happening even before that i would normally push myself but become irritable on those days im working on that now and learned how to manage it therell be days that i cant though but its okay im still starting to learn it afterall,0
you need to go to hospital you cant stop suddenly your blood pressure please go to hospital,0
people use to my mania im fun they get scared of my depression n worry,1
yes i have take care of yourself first and always degrees can wait your well-being is much more important dont feel you have to do everything at once because that is what others deem normal sometimes taking time off helps clarify which direction you want to go in your studies and possible career dont feel pressured to do thing on other peoples time table not everyone does college in 4 years or all at once please care for yourself first always ,0
lamictal wellbutrin and hydroxyzine [anxiety as needed] ive been on many different combinations and this so far with some adjustments in higher dosage has worked so far im so grateful for these meds and my own management using cbt ive finally found the right combination and counseling after 10 years that were very tough through mania and depression,1
i had it big time along with restless leg on latuda it started about 1 month into taking it so i stopped and it resolved immediately,1
please talk to your doctor i am on alprazolam three times a day hydroxine at night i feel you about the benzos but my docs are telling me and assuring me that there is nothing wrong with taking them take things a day at a time and just tell your doctor what is going on try and put your trust in the doctor i know this is difficult when you have anxiety you probably feel scared to trust i know i have been there please reach out and give it a try,0
this is me fibromyalgia restless leg syndrome ibs brain fog diabetes so people now know that most of the time i wont answer my front door if they knock uninvited,0
hey im so sorry youre going through all that that sounds heart wrenching especially with the added stresses of day to day life with both chronically ill and energetic children! you sound very strong and like you lead with your strength im sure your children admire the fierce example and light you give them and would undoubtedly miss you if you were to go you could visit your oldest and encourage him to have a meaningful life in or out of prison and try to survive together for a while that being said your life is yours and you owe it to no one i hope that in lieu of mess youre taking care of yourself in other ways journaling making time for walks (i always love river walks the water flowing makes me feel like i can move/breathe when im feeling dragged under) the whole "dark times pass" thing is bs but i find that if i tally up small moments of joy or feeling "awake" during the day they help balance darker thoughts to answer your question thoughts all the time i do think theres a difference between suicidal thoughts "i cant do this im not strong enough i want to just die and fade away my loved ones would be happier if i were dead" and suicidal ideation "heres how ill do it ill cancel this appointment to do it that morning sitting about to then walking away then going back writing letters with a time in mind specific" i get more scared of the latter even if thoughts are common,0
never be embarrassed these struggles we have arent our choice we do the best we can those of us that have family and friends to support us are lucky for their love id be lost without mine dont give up <3,0
i wasnt trying to blackmail you im crying out for help i did cut myself i just didnt show the police and didnt want you to worry im sorry i just missed you,0
call your states assistance line you can call 211 from any state to be connected to various social services they will hook you up with someone in your area that helps get meds for free or at a very low cost calling a free medical clinic is also a great idea i did both and was able to get all 4 of my meds free going cold turkey can set off episodes and make it difficult to deal with everyday life and the people in it call those places and tell them when you will run out of your meds so they can help you as soon as possible you can do this! there are a lot of ways to tackle this dont stress outit will work out if you find someone to help! ive had to do that twice and it worked out both times go online and look for a mental health clinic that serves the poor and those without insurance ive been going to one for over a year and they do free meds counseling and appointments with psychiatrists thats your first best option you can do this!,1
i recently decided to go back to therapy the first one did not "fit" but i love the second one! so remember you choose who you see and not the other way around if it does not feel right keep looking for the right one i spent way too much money on the wrong ones in the past who did not listen to me or what i wanted or needed but they really can help with your anxiety! good luck!!,0
i have worked for years on my a/d this is what has helped me for depression i take 5-htp and walk when i walk i have my talks with god and give all my problems to him i also sort a lot out walking i know who i can talk to when im starting to feel depressed i dont try to hide it anymore for anxiety i deep breathe some people have a mantra they repeat to get past the anxiety i just talk to myself and remind myself i am ok i also avoid stimulants,1
i have bipolar anxiety depression schizophrenia and adhd i was diagnosed when i was 23 yrs old im 46 now first idk who is saying smoke weed but grow up! second go for a walk i believe thats the most relaxing and calming for me no one is the same so try anything that takes your mind off things idc what it is writing drawing working gardening etc i think you get the idea i actually went thru a period of my younger life idk how old you are but again everyone is different mine was severe anxiety and depression and the adhd had a role also if youre just starting these symptoms now but i doubt it because i knew at age of 9 or 10 something wasnt right whatever happens at dr be honest thats the only way the doc can help if meds are prescribed take them some take a couple weeks to kick in others take 3-4 wks also if u have bad reactions and are worse or a reaction happens immediately tell doc im going to let you know you might not like this dr and he/she might dope u up i went thru literally up-to this day 32 drs took 7 years to get my right combo its going to-be tough but hang in there to this day even with meds i still have episodes very far between tho meds arent a cure theyre a part of your coping skills they are not are not a cure! when you find out what is actually going on do what youre supposed to do and keep doing it this also important you cant be comfortable with the dr get a new one you must be able to not be afraid to tell all that dr says no your ok time to get a new one if that dr says same maybe its something hormonal men get unbalanced also stay away from alcohol drugs etc they arent helping theyll make it worse god bless you and i know youll find that inner peace #livelovelaugh,1
unpopular opinion warning: i firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind i think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help the family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt and also means no family member will discover the body which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the persons life even more,0
i got a dog shes a big help but i just cant fight this feeling its overwhelming feels like im going to have a panic attack,0
me too i used too too do that im on trazadone 200 milograms and i sleep through the night was taking three different things since im allergic to benadryl i cant take that but ive been sleeping so not worried i also take abilify and other meds been on medicine since i was four the youngest case of bipolar theyd seen at scott and white,1
you do what you need to do absolutely put yourself first if they cant understand well that isnt your problem its theirs i am flying out of state in a week to go to my little brothers wedding my bipolar depression my agoraphobia and anxietymy borderline ugh its all flaring right now im really pushing myself to go because hes my only sibling and i helped raise him i just really want to be there im not going to let my mental illness stop me but thats my situation if there is an abuser in that scenario or your mental health is too overwhelming right now you have every right to not go do what you need to do to stay safe and stable you cant help what you have and it isnt your fault dont let anyone make you feel guilty for something you didnt chose to have in the first place i hope you are able to slow down and settle for a little while you will get back to where you need to be huge hugs <3,0
legality is no reflection of morality im irritated by this as cannabis has saved my life many times and is the only thing that has ever worked! i prefer nature at least i wont die,0
me too no fear just rage i just want to punch someone in the throat! i get very aggressive,0
or as my husband always tells me "dont worry cant figure out how to do that either,0
i was on abilify for a mood stabilizer i was on zoloft for anti depressant and klonopin for anxiety im bipolar ll all during my pregnancy and my son is perfectly healthy i went to massachusetts general hospital in boston ma for advice on what to take that would be safe for baby,1
the meds scare me worse then the mood swing and my own thoughts,1
hi i would have done what briana suggested i know from my illness i get really upset at whats happened to you and so please dont let it get on top of you sweep i t aside and move on i have ptsd and people has said that im okay i do watercolours! ggrr its so annoying how upsetting people can be with their big gobs!!,0
from this medication list im going to assume that youre being treated for bipolar disorder if that is true then you should not be on the cymbalta as this can make your bipolar worse the xanax (if taken everyday) latuda and depakote can be contributing to your fatigue the ritalin can be contributing to the anxiety which im assuming is what the xanax is for im not a psychiatrist and am not yet a health professional (currently still in pharmacy school) so i can only give you a personal opinion and not a medical opinion but in my personal opinion yes you are being overmedicated but i certainly have seen patients on more meds and bipolar (and mental health in general) is a complex disease state to treat as for your depakote you should get used to the new medication anywhere from 1 to 2 months if the irritability and fatigue do not go away by then or if they are affecting your daily life you should go talk to your psychiatrist about these effects and hopefully he/she will change up your therapy **edit: please please please dont stop any of your medications without discussing them with your prescriber first**,1
meditation is helping me with depression and anxiety,1
dont feel guilty for your feelings its family they should embrace you as you are period,0
i hear you i prefer to have more meaningful conversations with people and that makes it difficult and awkward to talk to people who dont want to think a bit deeper,0
hi there i only identify with drinking a ton of water because im constantly thirsty it works well for me so i see that as a minor inconvenience (plus i should drink more water than i used to anyway) the only big problem i had on it was when i was over my current dose as dr prescribed (past 300mg in am and 450 in pm) i was in such an unmotivated foggy state my advice would be that dont worry if it helps but isnt at the standard "therapeutic" dose even if your blood draw results come out that its low and youve been steadily taking it and not missing doses im at the dosage above and have been for some time after tapering down it still helps immensely so in my opinion dont be afraid to tell your doc to lower dose or even see if there is something else entirely even if youve tried s ton of different meds i know i didnt tough on all your concerns but i hope this helped a bit i wish someone had told me sooner that the "standard" therapeutic dose is what most people are on but some people are different and their dose that works for them can be different best of luck to you ❤️,1
i have not been in this situation so i cannot recomend anything definative my only words areif youcan see a good therapist to work you through this find a good lawyer to help your legal road ahead find a therapist for your daughter to get her through this as well do not beat yourself up over the little things like dishes and housework if you have family or friends near by see if they would be willing to help out these are little things and not worht stressing over too mcuh (if your children are old enough enlist them to help some of my fondest childhood memories are contributing to the home and helping mom clean house after saturday morning cartoons) when able speak with your doctor about any and all medicine concernsyou may even need to think about a psychologist for this (i never had good things with paxil but diffrent meds work for diffrent people and keep that in mind) and most importantly! you are an amazing woman and strong mother for protecting your children!!!!! do not sell yourself short on that and do not sell your children short on any second guesses or wishfull thinking times are tought but they will get better; thought it may take a while hang in there (also) being late for work dragging through day by day fighting to get up in the morningthese are understandable youve just gone through a shock again if you can therapist other than that give yourself permission to have the bad days it happens even to the best of us talk to your employer about the being late if it is an issue you dont have to get into details but ive found most are pretty understanding when going through traumatic life occurances,1
sorry but l disagree l was hit with crippling anxiety very similar to you l am a strong person i took anti depressants in combination with therapy on the nhs and two years later l am far better medication is sometimes the answer,1
i live in aust and work in this system firstly get your keys back  even if it means police involvementmake your self safe the unfortunately until he actually hurts himself or someone you cant do anything so gently with someone there for support tell him he cant come to your house making threats and treating you that way  because of his age and reguadless of his age you cant do anything unless you are his legal guardian then he cant get a passport without your signature but its a lot of legal stuff and he needs to agree unless deemed unfit  but none of this will happen without him having an incident that called for legal interjection the law is very definitive for people with disabilities and mental health if you are threatened again or frightened lock yourself in the car or go to a neighbour and call police this can initiate the process he needs proper support from professionals maybe even a stay in a locked facility because you cant force him to take meds and even a group home isnt gonna help him in this state esp if hes violent  there are lots of rules in group homes you need to get the police involved have him sectioned to a ward for evaluation for fear of your and community safety its really awful to go through but please put yourself first and be safe ,0
google "night terrors" or "sleep paralysis" and you should find a pretty good explanation of the situation its not that uncommon and sometimes just knowing what it is makes it easier to deal with,1
alcohol and drugs will not only interfere with your antidepressant it is potentially very harmful to your unborn child to be honest your post come across as being a bit blase you need to take to take some responsibility depression and anxiety are not excuses for being aggressive towards other people has anyone mentioned anger management to try and find more positive ways to deal with your emotions and anger dont know how old you are but you sound fairly young are you really ready to be responsible for another human being? it doesnt sound as if you are particularly as you are doing things that could harm your baby seek support from your family friends or social services as you are going to need it however you also need to work towards better health it doesnt just happen by itself unfortunately wish you good luck,1
the way ive learned to deal with my anxiety on the road is a little unorthodox i use a fidget spinner it occupies just enough of my attention to ignore most of the annoyances,1
exactly how i been feeling as of late i always try to push forward but recently it just feels like its so much harder things that i use to look forward to dont matter anymore im not myself the self that was barely there to begin with and its horrible,0
addicts brains arent the same as a non addict i never said addiction wasnt real either simply that it is the fault of the addict and the addict only back to the brain an addicts brain deteriorates over time but only by choice hate to break it to you if you dont touch the shit in the first place you wont have to worry about killing your brain my 44 year old mother is an addict and i hate her now because she chose meth over my sisters she acts like a 15 year old by choice because she put the pipe to her lips in the first place,0

a wise man once said you can sleep when your dead worry about it you will get there a lot quicker,1
you have to allow yourself to grieve but keep taking care of yourself talking about it here or in any place you feel safe to is a good start i got a dog a few years ago and she changed my life for the better in more ways than i can describe youre sad and thats okay trust yourself to find another passion to get motivated about maybe reading to people in the hospital or nursing homes or perhaps just dropping in to visit everybody needs encouragement and to know that someone cares that goes for you as well dont be afraid to ask for what you need people that love you want to help but usually dont know how,0
i might just have to go in as a walk in which is a pain cause it takes a couple of hours atleast how long does the side affects last i cant handle too much longer need to find out if its the pill or scared its allergic reaction or some other illness,1

effexor extended release at 150m is what i am on and i have been on this for almost 10 years now i aint going to lie it is horrible if you go cold turkey off of it if you wheen yourself off not so bad now every day feeling its made me maintain at an even keel but from what i am reading from everyone responding is that its totally individual and i would try it and if you feel like its not making things even for you then wheen yourself off slowly,0
my best friend is a lot like me he and i both have ptsd bi polar along with a few other things we can fight pushing the boundaries and still end laughing maybe not the same day but mostly hes got a very violent temper and so do i although i wouldnt put my hands on anyone he would weve had some really beyond boundaries fights and he wouldnt ever lay a hand on me im safe with him first guy in my life im safe with leave just leave being with someone controlling and violent regardless of bipolar is not ok dont let him hurt you it wont get better and its your life and your peace of mind you need to protect i learned this way too late and wish i had left my husband in the first year of marriage instead i stayed lived in fear and much very horrific abuse for 15 years he finally was sentenced to 14-28 yrs in federal prison hes been there 10 he gets out in 4 im back to being afraid and so much more just go get out for you,0
i want to add that my mother had bipolar challenges whereby i couldnt give her support and lived in fear of experiencing her harmful episodes she would think she had started feeling better and therefore stop her medicationsthen downward shed go this was a good teacher: i always take my meds and basically speaking i run fairly balanced (much much better) but still need to pay close attention,0
i was told years ago i had bipolar type two but then told i did not so years of trying to manage my severe anxiety and depression by self and begging for someone to help i got phychosis from being so ill so was sectioned hospital stay for couple months 2 years later i had a manic episode and was sectioned and then a depressive episode and sectioned then told i have bipolar 1 and 2 if treated in the first place i would not have gone on to mania and had phychosis again im on lots of meds hate it but keeps me stable but feel flat and like a zombie in the morngings  the mania is completely different than to manic in type 2 this time i thought i was working for the cia i was also eve my partner was adam etc but the low after the come down is so horrid  its hard for us all as we have to stay positive to stay well but days where we feel so fatigued and heavy,1
i have lived with anxiety for about 20 years also social anxiety which i have under control thanks to support groups and plenty of coping skills my meds are a very low dose so i rely on what i have been taught in therapy and especially group therapy i strongly suggest going to mental health or behavioral health and taking these groups i believe from my own experiences meds alone didnt fix my diagnosis in fact i was over medicated and my life was falling apart i lost count but i have been hopsitalized 12 times and i understand having resentment to god as to why he would do this to me thorazine shots haldol shots five point restraint isolation rooms taking my friends and family away who i loved with all my heart it was the excessive force or several beatings i have taken from up to five male staff members and hearing two female staff members screaming for them to stop saying your hurting him but they didnt stop i guess they were tryng to teach me a lesson not to stand up for others or myself so i stopped praying for many years mad at god luckily my faith in god kept me from ending my life someone questioned gods plan and i understand i know work for the mental health system and i am a board member for behavioral health and work for kings view as a certified peer support specialist you see god wasnt done with my journey and now i see his plan clearly everything i have been through i believe happened for a reason so i can help others just like,1
it will help you quit smoking but its terrible for anxiety or bpd,1

i couldnt share the original post from vellum and vinyl so i copied and pasted it: "psa no one fucking tells you this so here it is: when signing out forms to apply for disability / filling out a form for diagnosis you’re supposed to fill it out as you on your worst days like i filled out forms that said i could do most things usually like my doctor added in the conditions like “yeah they can feed themselves when not stressed” “they can do this when not stressed” but how i should have filled it out was more like “some days i can’t feed myself” “some days i can’t leave the house” my doctor didn’t even know this but i talked to someone who had worked with people with both developmental and intellectual disabilities for a number of years and she told me to write down how it is for your bad days this should be a thing they tell you but it isn’t part of the reason i didn’t get my autism diagnosis as soon as i should have is because i filled out forms wrong!",0
same feeling i went up to 100 mg as i was juggling grad school family with a daughter having mental issues and a full time job as a ms teacher at a treatment facility i would cry from stress and anxiety just graduated so starting to feel a little more even but i can even think about not taking my meds in fear i would drown in a deep dark hole i am lucky my husband understands,0
i firmly believe that there should be an option for human euthanasia in cases where the person has been treated for a suitable length of time and analysed by different doctors and all other options have been exhausted if the person would still prefer death to the hell they suffer every day in their own mind i think that there should be a mandatory waiting period for them to change their minds or for family members to step up their game on offering actual help the family should be present to say final goodbyes (alleviates their guilt and also means no family member will discover the body which is extremely traumatic) before a painless euthanasia is performed having this option available may prevent botched suicide attempts which can actually lead to injuries that ruin the persons life even more,0
heard of it but thats about it im afraid its a suicide crisis centre where someone can go to for 5 days as a form is respite and to recover without judgment it seems a really good centre and its a shame there arent more!,0
initially made me very tired but that wore off after a few weeks i started out on 75mg then was increased to 150mg and then 225mg psychiatrist wanted to up them further as he stated they work differently at a higher dose but i wasnt so keen on that idea they did help my mood a little but not enough for me to keep taking them i had very few side effects from them each person is different though so theyre always worth trying i struggle to remember to take my meds as well so i sort them out into a weekly pill organiser and keep them next to to the bed i drink a lot during the night so my pills are by were i keep my drink and​ that way i tend to remember them good luck x,1
i suffer from very bad anxiety and i am on xannax and clonazepam i do not tell people either except my parents and husband what meds i am on you should not be scared or discouraged because you are getting the help that you need! tons of people just self medicate and dont want to get the help so you are going in the right direction by seeing someone and taking meds this forum is great and everyone on here should understand good luck and stay strong :),1
so when you ask what the two illnesses aretheyre similar in that they tend to have moodiness involved impulsivity and self-damaging behaviors for compensatory measures otherwise theyre not really that similar but they do seem to "like" one another and often show up in the same personmaking their lives chaotic difficult dysfunctional and intense so if your friend is concerned that they may have one (or both) of these illnesses they should not be ashamed its definitely not their fault they should instead get help from a professionaland insist that they are treated appropriately with the correct types of therapy and medication,0
i think u should call the doctor first things monday tell them exactly how u r feeling and let them know its an emergency if they cannot get u in on monday u need to ask them what u r suppose to do?? be assertive and tell them that u need help its not okay for you to feel this way and mental health is as important as physical health! u must take care of yourself because you r worth it im currently in a very similar situation and i make sure i let my doctor know dealing with mental health and the mental health field can be horrible until monday i think you should take care of yourself take a nice warm bath or shower get ur comfy clothes on call someone who understands what u r going thru reach out to other here or send me a message i know what u r going thru you will be in my thoughts know that u r not alone in this!!,0
i agree with all the therapy responses but my personal opinion is i think 7 is still a bit young to try an explain a mental health condition before i snap on my kids i need remind myself to think through what is im about to yell about does it warrant raising my voice? what words to choose and how to convey them definitely consult a physician but i worry that my kids my blow off a scolding by chalking it up to depression and not taking me seriously when they really are in trouble,0
believe me i am not trying to outdo you but when i was diagnosed it was easier to say what i didnt have then it was to say what i did have white sent me into early retirement even the judge was surprised i didnt break down sooner because i had long work history at one job one of my disorders is a social disorder that is very devastating when im around a lot of people and more so when i dont know them i do push myself to try to tolerate as long as i can when i go to town i only go once or twice a month sometimes a third but not very often because being around a lot of people send me into a anxiety panic attack then my blood pressure goes out the roof yes mental disorders can kill if one is not careful because of the stress it puts on one person but like the judge said he knew that didnt happen overnight and could not see how i lasted as long as i did one of the other things that happen i had a complete nervous breakdown and to close cause of having two more when my therapist got me into a group she said i should have been hospitalized but i did not have the money or insurance and was laid off from my job i dont blame my xbox for doing it because i was not only a danger to myself but to other coworkers thats been 12 years ago since able to hold a job since then ive not been able to work a regular job ever again because of the anxiety panic attacks this next part is not for everyone 7 years ago i was faced with a dilemma i do not know how my therapist worked it out but all i had to use is my government insurance to pay for it but a year after i got out of the group home and my therapist at the time retired with the new replacement i was being charged by the doctor therapist and nurse and also have to pay for my medication i could pay out of pocket and only cover two or maybe even three but not all because the insurance will only cover so much and the rest had to come out of my pocket that i did not have because ssdi does not pay a whole lot out so i had to come up with another solution to the problem with guidance of a doctor that i did not have to pay i wing myself off the medication and start using vitamins herbs and oils that has worked for me for the last 7 years but like i said before this is not for ever one and just like the medications it was a trial and error before i could find the right combination that works for me so i suggest to anyone that is wanting to try this research it out first and talk to your physician about it before starting even though i am doing self-medication natural stuff one still has to be carefull because the wrong combination can be more devastating than the problem itself so research it out if you are thinking about and talk to your doctor too,1
i think the majority of us with bpd self isolate sometimes it is just easier than going out and feeling anti social on top of that we wanna go out really bad but cant because the pressure is too great if you need anything im pretty sure the group members whould be able to help just knowing you arent alone we are fighting the fight right along with you!,0
i used to feel pretty much the same way (i didnt cry or get sad but i would stress out severely leading up to the event) i finally just starting telling people the truth i dont attend parties where i wont know almost everyone there i do not like crowds i hate being hot so i dont go to picnics or beach parties i really hate when people try to convince me to go: im 48 years old pretty sure i know what i do and dont want to do i hope you get out and do something for yourself that you enjoy,0
the first step is to make sure hes not using drugs or alcohol because thats not helpful at all when you have depression and try to commit suicide a lot of people do that because they using narcotics or drinking alcohol the thing is sometimes people dont say whether they coming from it will be easy i think like for me to let you know where you can get help because i dont even know where are people location cuz im in new york city right now dont give up i cant stop writing you about my life because what will never finish trust me i taking care of my daughter we bipolar disorder my son we bipolar autism as bergen adhd and more and more diagnosis and myself we bipolar ptsd anxiety depression fibromyalgia what else do you want you want me to continue telling you my diagnosis trust me sweetie im not going to give up and no diagnosis i got days i dont want to leave but i realize the only person can take my life as god you strong woman you doing the right thing and i know in this page will be the right person to conduct yourself why you guys got to do as a family but never feel guilty what you write make me feel even cry because i know you have to be a wonderful woman thats what he pick you and look hes bad days you are there for him just continued prayers to god god bless you and i hope everything goes well for you and your family,0
thanks everyone for the feeedback i know that some ppl are against medications but some ppl just have to have them i have also been on klonopin for years for my anxiety attacks i have been through a very big ordeal i cannot even remember being in the hospital or what even happened to me i dont even remember my friends and family even coming to visit me i have had a very deep depression and that is just not me i have to at least try something to see if it works my doctor says the patience that he has on the medicine has had a very good success rate with it i also have pain and i understand that it is used for pain as well and as far as giving it to god that so have done i pray about my life and my lifes situations quite often imagine going in for a simple procedure and ending up in icu on an intebator and then coming out with over 100k dollars in hospital and doctor bills to boot! this had also effected my marriage and i just got married last october so if i have to try a medication for my depression hell its at least worth a try i just hate side effects but i understand thats a risk with any medication,0
on "good" days where im not affected by mental health or physical pain i find myself in bed because of overwhelming fatigue im too tired to even enjoy the good days for the most part,0

mika haara we all die none of us gets out of this alive however you are here on earth for a reason now we all have choices not to choose is making a choice life is a fight and everyone has their own fight their own pain all of us are fighting for our minds there is right and wrong good and bad love and fear once we fight for ourselves we can take our experience speak to others in pain and walk along side them to pull them out of darkness but no one can want you to live more than you want to live for yourself you have the power and all you need inside you to live a great life you cant see it for some reason but there is greatness in you!!! we all have the power to choose life if you want to live i pray you choose life❤️,0
if the combo has relieved you of symptoms dont rock the boat klonopin stays around for some time in your system and can usually get away with taking less than perscribed given you are taking a small dose but a through out the day 2mg which is about a normal michele im not a doctor but i have studied pharmacology to its basics giving adderall with klonopin? that mighy not be a good idea plus adding into gabapentin? ouch doxepin as well? see if your doctor can minimize this combo over time your brain and body are not going to like being up and down like that adderall is certainly something you may do with out as it causes anxiety and can agitate insomnia panic attacks and a schizoaffective disorder,1
i cannot move if i dont take my meds im so scared i go completely off my rocket im too scared to try and not take them and believe me i drink alot im also diabetic so injections as well ,1
i took all my medicine for bipolar/anxiety/ depression safely my daughter is 14 and perfectly fine i had blood work done every month to make sure my liver was doing well i also had extra sonograms to ensure she was developing properly i think if you have your ob/gyn and physchiatrist work together throughout your pregnancy you should be able to take your meds throughout on a side note - if you are stressed the baby will be stressed as well always weigh the pros vs the cons,1
april nelson thankyou hun he has a lot of love from certain ppl but he is confused about whats going on but he is slowly accepting the diagnoses now we just miss him xxxx,0
go to er and they have to help you tell them you are struggling and you need emergency medical that works in california but see what they can do where you live also most psychiatrist have free samples ask your doctor for help good luck,1
i suffered from serious panic attacks and was diagnosed with panic disorder i learned that my neck injury was actually the cause if your atlas bone (top vertebra in your neck) is out of alignment it causes the interference of your bodys ability to properly function such as improper flow of cerebral fluid it basically causes your brain to not be able to flush properly and is deprived of the proper flow of fluid my neck has been holding correct alignment now for three months and i have not had a panic attack the entire time where i used to have them all the time if you would like any more info you can pm me :-),1

i told an abusive partner who "used" suicide as a threat to manipulate me i once told him if he did it wouldnt be my fault taken out of context those are unbelievably horrible words to say to someone whos just said theyre suicidal so i understand this person just wanting more context may not change the outcome obviously that was a bad relationship for the both of us,0
how is it possible you dont see how amazing it is you lived thru everything you dealt with growing up? your story is amazing and im sure could help someone else struggling have you ever thought about using your experiences to help others ? it might help heal you in the process of giving you some self-worth there are lots of support groups you could join youve made it so far dont give up!! god is preparing you for greatness keep praying but get involved with some support groups to help you continue to heal,1

yes i do that alot wake up heart beating out my chest n awful sweats n panic attack!!,0
i feel for you i can talk this way whenever you need please do not hesitate ok,0
yes from all the comments here there are many things you can do check with your state to see what mental health services they offer most will have free meds for you and you can call their emergency number which is listed on the state website some states do use the first call for help line of 211 and hospitals will help you will not lose your kids as long as you show you are getting help social services may visit you in the hospital to see how you are doing but thats ok as long as you have a stable and safe clean home they wont take your child most of the time they dont even get involved unless someone calls to make a charge so dont worry,1
as a medical professionaldo not google meds it will just make you crazy! anytime anyone has a "side effect" and reports it it will be put on prescription leaflets and websites as a side effecteven if one person in the whole world was the only person to have this side effect youll worry yourself sick about having the same experience knowledge is power discuss with your doctor the side effects that you have experienced on previous meds or that youve heard of others experiencing they are there to help you( if they are a good doctor that is) and will discuss pros and cons of the medication i have turned down certain medications because i didnt want to take a chance on certain side effects after discussing it with my doctor you should never feel afraid to ask your doctor your questions different meds are going to work better for others due to their genealogy there is testing nowadays that they can test what medication would work best with your individual gene structure and has helped stop a lot of the trial and error med trials many of us have endured hope this helps,1
hi i found out i had bipolar 2 at 14 i wish i could say it will just get easy all of a sudden you will get better when you try getting better give every treatment a fair go and be willing to try if 30 year old me could tell teenage me anything it would be take all the help they offer i wish you all the very best and dont be afraid its a blessing and a curse my inbox is always open if you need another bipolar lifer to talk too we need to stick together!,1
my husband takes serequel for anxiety but he also has schizo-effective disorder,1
it gets overwhelming and exhausting and theni still worry and have doubts,0
i moved away from home and when i say away i am talking 22 hrs away i made excuses not to visit during holidays and i lived my life vicariously through phone and web /social media shared content until my family started to drift off i had children i had major life crisis happen and i worked with my psych team and the very few so very few friends who actually were let past the fake smiles and sarcastic cover ups of my mood swings and the fake i dont feel goods cancelations until i truly began to work through the roots of my issues and began some true self acceptance of my conditions then i became an advocate speaking out to others in need speaking up to others just coming into therapy just starting out just reaching out begging no matter how scary it gets and it will get scary please dont run away dont go backwards go forwards slowdown if you need to just dont stop and dont turn around i have been there i have turned around more than once i have stood still stuck in place and spinning circles even wanting help wishing for help and terrified of what was to come of the next step because getting that far was so painful i was the oldest of our bunch if and born in the early 80s growing up all over the usa with a mother raised in the deep south who married a pipeliner foreman with control issues from louisiana if that give any of you older guys in here an idea of the issues i had to work through it has been almost 20 years since i left home and my dad has new step dad has died my moms first husband the pipeliner died and my mom has become bed bound i still harbor some feelings i know i so as much as i feel like i worked through them i know i fell it when i see my mother and she she ask my to care for her in some way that lil kid pops up wants to scream and yell everyone can take care of himself cant they and i have to remember that she cant and i am not a kid with my own issues any more taking care of an addict,0
my meds work fine thanks just thought it may be too much but people in here are on a lot more then me so that makes me feel a bit better an not so panicky,1
id want them to validate me in that yes i struggle with bipolar disorder that is not all that i am it is not my identity it is part of it completely wanting to squash it is very ignorant in my opinion and they (and countless others around the world) need to end the stigma ps i have such issues finishing projects and lose interest after a short or long burst of intense making (knitting in my case) buy tons of yarn then get too apathetic and depressed to knit so i feel you also i am polish too which i thought was great that you mentioned for the chuckle and for the way that it is a part of you just like bp and should be treated as such hope that helps,0
for me bipolar makes it hard to leave things in the past and get rid of baggage lets be honest- maybe i dont want to but im learning everyday even though ive been dealing with this for 20yrs now it never stops being hard but it does get less hard dont worry about what you missed worry about how its enriching your life to be able to put the pieces together hope this helps,0
i unfortunately dropped out of college i had anxiety attacks everyday my teachers werent accommodating at all they basically told me to choose between my education or my health i chose my health it was for the best i can always go back,0
good that you are supporting her but before that please please try to find out the reason why it all started whats all is going in back of her mind which is troubling her she might be hesitant to share it easily but u have to find out that rather going for medications i know it is necessary but try to figure out the reasons first as no one is born with this illness ,1
more scary than anything my period started and didnt stop for six months (pergesterone stops your period estrogen makes you ovulate) and because testosterone is produced elsewhere i now have alot of unwanted hair across my body which im insecure about and that definitely doesnt help the libido issues but after that all happened they tried me on lithium which made me overly suicidal so got taken off it and they dont want to try any other meds because of the issues so have had to do a bunch of therapy to teach me other ways to cope and try to control the swings and recognize them etc its hard and definitely not easy to be with me just hoping we can sort out our issues and fix things before its too late,1
getting into a routine of exercise and weight training is extremely helpful no one around here prescribes actual anxiety medication anymore,1
i hear ya!!! keep this in mind for anxiety/panic attacks to help ground you back in reality,1
i do not have mania but citalopram is working for me for anxiety and related depression i was put on sertraline during my recent episode in dec-feb which should do the same thing - serotonin increase - but made me much much worse i went straight back to my gp and went on meds i knew worked for me in the past there are so many medications and so a degree of experimentation given everyone with brain illness is different we can call it the same thing bit we all experience these illness slightly differently and of course some worse than others it the same for the meds are you trying other things that are non pharmaceutical to try to manage your symptoms - for example meditation therapy/counselling etc see related web sites and resources at and ,1
im 26 weeks and these 26 weeks have been hell to say the least depression and anxiety are off the charts and i had ppd with my first born wanting to breastfeed with my son who is due in november but not sure how much more of the roller coaster of emotions i can take,1
as i said weight loss is initially the reason im on it the other effects are just bonuses at this stage im only allowed it three times a week to avoid dependence & resistance,0
i usually try use proper spelling and grammar im far from perfect but even when texting i use sentences and never use "u" "2"  etc some friends poke fun at me for it but i just find it easier to understand! sometimes i get so confused with all the lingo! ~dani,0
wow me again sometimes ive told people whats going on with me then they either just walk away and not talk or just shake their head and laugh so i stopped talking about it,0
great advice! i agree! im on my 3rd week of group dbt therapy and was hesitant at first but its actually comforting to know im not alone and now with a caring group of people not knowing her whole situation (whether the niece knows or not) she may be trying to show she cares by insisting for her being there maybe not knowing? if she knows then she should definitely be more understanding if not its good to know she cares enough to want her there i know not being wanted is a bad feeling as well its a shame abusers go unpunished in a perfect world shed be able to attend and that jerk would be banned sad,0
i feel the same way about my anxiety sometimes i cant explain why im feeling anxious because i dont know why,0
or whether it will be a debilitating depressive episode or an extreme anxiety episode,1
i was never a religious person at all i mean i believed something was there but didnt know what and then i got appendicitis granted not the same thing as that and after that i have just been so anxious and i feel like god maybe used that experience to draw me closer to him because i started praying and asking for himi havent prayed in a while though and feel rather guilty about it,0
ive had it for 17 years everyday is a struggle but i have found with therapy the right meds and spousal support it is possible to make it the older i get the worse it gets i just chose to handle it differently,1
they told me this was a mood stabilizeri told her i need something for in the moment breakdowns and she said lets get this up to a good dosage first and see if you need something after thati am scared and not very authoritive,0
not good i went crazy on it self harming 2-3 times a day couldnt function properly my anxiety went through the roof x,0
it is soooo hard to get the motivation started though the only way i get moving is when i have a dr appointment or a psych appointmenteven that is a struggle! my husband tries to help alot and can get me moving on occasion but i have gained almost double my weight since being on meds for 9 years changing them every so often but nothing seems to help!!! so i understand completely!!!!!,1
if you have a good friend or family member ask them to sort an appointment for you medication was the only thing in the end i am bipolar general anxiety disorder social phobia stress how i coped initially was by training in cognitive behavioral therapy on a distance learning course this showed me techniques to stop over thinking and how to handle dysfunctional thoughts you can probably go on to you tube and google a session of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety the other thing i used a lot again found on you tube was guided meditation for anxiety or you can get a quick one for panic attacks etc although these coping methods got me through for years i am just the happiest most balanced i have ever been since being on medication i still meditate and use coping techniques and i do battle daily just on a lesser scale enabling me to enjoy i am not so quick as i was before but thats okay good luck you can do it one vital thing also before i go is learn to breathe properly hugs xx,1
alll for my anxiety they say,1
this comment has really pist me off it is not easy living with ptsd or bpd do you think we dont want help? do you think we dont want to work? because you are so wrong our brains are constantly wondering what the point of life is even when we dont want to think that shit it just happens and then the anxiety kicks in and then the depression of constantly not wanting to be the way we are its exhausting for us then there is the constant repeat of talking about the same crap over and over again with the psychiatrist you just sound selfish and gave up you think your life is hard not getting child support? try living with suicide thoughts everyday and not wanting it in your head anymore take note everything on your post is me me me me me i i i i i,0
bi polar ii rapid cycling schizoaffective disorder generalized anxiety disorder (with social and agro phobia increasing anxiety symptoms) panic attacks (caused by phobia issues and ptsd attacks) ptsd stress anxiety and panic induced blackouts and functional blackouts i went through a wonderful pletra of meds trying to control the bulk of symptoms and maintain consciousness and to figure out exactly what my diagnoses where its not a pretty road and i am thankful that when i had given up on everything i had someone come into my life and inch and nudge me and build me up to going back and became my voice when i had no words to explain,1
my husband had a very hard time excepting it we saw our other two sons thrive in life one has his phd and the other is a comic (who suffers from depression and anxiety but still can deal with it) after years of counseling his therapist said to home school him my husband said each day when we drove him to school was like taking him to a funeral he wanted so bad for him to be normal our son from day one was different from the other two do i want him to be normal yes do i want him to be happy yes do we all still have hope yes? but for now it is what it is and one day i hope there is a great advancement in drugs or treatment he is a wonderful caring young man and is willing to be a guinea pig he wants to get better he hopes he will get better but for now we just wait and live this way god bless,0

no pressure tho i am  after all  a stranger to you,0
for me quitting means i am letting the bipolar win and im being a slave to my diagnosis my work is what keeps me from being sent to a psych ward work helps to focus me on something other than my illness sure my focus isnt great and my work is sub par in my book im still being productive and keeping up to deadlines otherwise id just be sat at home dwelling on how crap i feel and that leads to a huge pity party for 1 and thats s place i just dont want to be if you need to take a few days off as a break then do it i have the next week off just so i can recharge my batteries i have self care planned getting my nails done having lunch with my sister going for a coffee date with my father and going shopping for a new mattress then the rest of the time i can sleep watch tv catch up on netflix that kinda thing with all that said i say just dont quit,0
other signs that you are dangerously paranoid include following crap like this,0
married one had a baby he left it got 100% worse once baby arrived being with someone with a mental illness is incredibly stressful and draining waking up and being on eggshells every day/hour not knowing what mood they will be in is very challenging especially a person who is not willing to accept their diagnosis and will not accept help,0

i am bipolar this is semantics and everyone is too fucking sensitive about the words we choose i dont "have" bipolar its not the flu its not acne its not something i can get rid of its not something that magically developed over the course of my life i was born bipolar and i will be bipolar until the day i die i dont "have" anything except a bad case of irritation with sensitive little babies who are bothered by me using the wrong words,1

latuda was bad for me zombie weight gain threw up if i didnt take it precisely a half hour after eating paranoia and a general just wrong and off feeling it put me to sleep like the dead within minutes and i was so tired all day i couldnt even stay awake,1
me too we just have to remember that there are times when we do feel "normal" even if its short lived and keep our perspective that this low time will pass either on its own or with a change in meds/ therapy also i for one have to give myself permission to rest and be unproductive for awhile because i know thats how my body operates ive been trying to go with the flow lol sometimes it works sometimes not at least we can take comfort in knowing that we are definitely not alone in our struggles❤️ god is here and so is facebook ,0
start by telling your doctor about all of your symptoms the right medication can go a long way towards getting you back on track i have major depression anxiety ocd ptsd insomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome ive been at rock bottom including not being able to get out of bed to care for my family for days my doctor wasnt interested in reporting me only in helping me and you need to be honest with your husband he is your partner and your support system chances are he will be way more concerned about your well being than anything else,1
i take mine as soon as i wake up i have anxiety and depression so i find if i dont then im setting myself up for a bad day of anxiety attacks finding excuses not to go out over thinking every little detail about everything and just sit all day in my pjs feeling sorry for muself i find if i take it straight away with my cup of tea first thing then i am ok for the day most times i can get on with only minor blips,1
claire jenkins like how we both reacted to this! so true everyday struggle,0
lithum and celexa been playing with others but no good was taking 1mg of risperdol and i went frikimg paranoid and could not sleep only afer a cpuple days droped that quick still have paranoya and anxiety but more managable,1
you might ask your doctor about cymbalta i was the closest ive ever been to happy when i took that medication does wonders for anxiety too,1
i have bipolar one and anxiety! i take my meds deal with the hard days and carry on i deal with it we have a mental disorder we are not the disorder !,1
ive been on a low dose at times and so was my son in me it caused a small increase in appetite and a few pounds of weight gain not even five in him in hugely increased his appetite and they changed his meds but the benefit of having moods and anger - irritability controlled? worth it i do recommend getting your prolactin levels checked if youre on it any real length of time it can cause them to rise resulting in those side effects others discussed,1
love my latuda i take a higher dose so i do take it around bedtime but had to go off of it do to running out and noticed a big difference inderal helps my anxiety i take 10 mg 3x a day but am more able to do normal things without panic attacks like run to the grocery store latuda did make me gain weight but thats the only side effect i remember i think its a great combo,1
nothing is bad everything is manageable sweetie you need a med that kills two birds with one stone preferably and the best and proven on the market is lithium its a mood stabilizer i also take zonisamide for depression but it has an edge for anxiety to it i do that at night ask your doctor,1
there is light at the end of the tunnel its a struggle but worth it ask your doctor to change your meds i am on venlafaxine and stresam and all i can do is praise this wonderful combination also meditation and cognitive behavioural therapy worked for me too perhaps try exercising too i took up golf a great tiring walk with a purpose good luck remember you have people who love you,1
my advice? get out of the relationship asap get friends/relatives/police involved in order to remove your things without feeling threatened,0
i think having bipolar you actually have to go through those ups and downs different meds therapy and sometimes even inpatient treatment its a struggle that will never disappear but what helps me the most is faith in god and positive thinking someone told me to find what makes me happy and pursue it im still strugglingeven gave up on god lost relationships isolated myself to the point of having social anxiety afraid of people i just put on a mask and fight the days ahead with positive thinkingsome days are good and some days are bad but i thank god i made it through spreading love and courage to you ,0
hopefully she will get better and not worse i wish i had been on anti anxiety meds when i was a teenager and in college because anxiety and panic attacks are crippling and a lot of problems come from severe anxiety as a young person,1
this is great but as yenz has said its so hard to do i would really love to do this anybody else struggle with it? :/,0
zombeaverlol trust me look it up its one of those "this is so horribly awful but i must watch to laugh at" movies low budget completely​ cheesy killer of teen zombie beavers lmao,1
someone i can truly trust to confide in it sure isnt my man i do not trust him with my inner deep feelings i always seem to feel that he is a liar and im not sure about it at times like a conartist f with me some of my days are okay and some are packed with confusion tons of stress love--hate relationship on my behalf i want my cake and eat it too at times life at times is very tormenting inside my mind i dont know if im coming or going,0
then let me rephrase my comment latuda works to alleviate depression symptoms in bipolar patients my bad what i was trying to stress was that there wasnt a "mood stabilizer" in this combination of medicines this person is taking now let me clarify when i say "mood stabilizers" most of these medications are actually anti-convulsant drugs im referring to them as "mood stabilizers" for simplicity purposes:-),1
my oldest son has this along with ptsd it is a struggle for him everyday and i admire him for staying strong love you nicky,0
i usually get a manic episode in the end of march beginning of april and then again in august and yes my sex drive goes in over drive i wont lie at first i kind of enjoy the mania after depression the first day or so at least maybe but as others have said its important to get back on a stabilizer to get it back under control a few days without sleep flu like symptoms we start forgetting what we are doing and not evening knowing what is happening around us i am actually schizoaffective disorder bipolar type as well as ptsd with anxiety i know sometimes i feel i can go without meds or i just hate the side effects my fiance as much as i love him can be so unsupportive when it comes to my mental health but this is about you and your well being you come first,0
this is true especialy for bipolar both therapy and meds work best i have bp and anxiety and have been able through years of therapy learn coaping stratgies and recognize when an episode is coming right now i am not on medication for either because the therapy has been sucessfull i still have issues sometimes still see my therapist and doctor to make sure i stay ok but ive been able respond in a healthy way and avoid trouble,1
do you have situations i call them records that keep playing a life experience in your head and you cant control the records do they make you cry or freeze or throw you into anxiety or panic? also do you have to keep the same doctor sometimes freash eyes see more,1
you can get your meds pre packaged for morning noon evening and bed time it costs me $900 a month to have that and it makes things so less stressful,1
the struggle is real as much for your loved ones as for yourself,0
i had bad anxiety i dint sleep for 3 days not even a nap,1
and it seems like her comment is gone talking herself up like she chose help and we dont "im a success story im not a victim your opinion is your own im going to continue to better myself" saying we arent trying we sit in this group and play victim oh and we are insecure apparently shes all perfect now because she doesnt get mad lol and because she chooses to love and have confidence she made me feel like a piece of shit! well if shes all better she can leave she was a piece,0
every one does different on the drugs but the main thing is dont be afraid of them keep a journal when you start your meds to keep track of the side effects it might take a month to start seeing positive results but dont stop taking them ive been on meds for 9 years and we finally have a combination that works best for me and yes get blood work done my doctor has me mine checked every 6 months for tegretol levels,1
yeahyou know you are getting realngood at hiding when you can hide an anxiety attack not the big ones but some of the otherd,1
please take your meds you need them its nothing to be ashamed about ive come to accept that ill need to be on meds for the rest of my life i have bipolar ii and depression i couldnt function without my meds,1
i was taking the lowest dose you can for my period i actually got worse because my lack of energy made me upset i had issues with school and have really been struggling to keep up on life due to it i stopped taking the friday ( my doctor said i could also take as needed ) i wont ever be taking that again,1
youre not alone christine you have this board i know how you feel my family doesnt understand either i feel like they say "shell get over it" not knowing i would if i could there are many of us who suffer which unfortunatly horrible,0
to all of you saying suicide is selfish do you realise youre telling someone already suffering from crippling mental and physical pain self doubt and worthlessness they are also selfish shameonyou for adding to that pain if you are feeling that suicide is the only option please reach out to a mental health professional let your loved one know how youre feeling call a helpline in your region or if you have faith talk to a minister/rabbi/mufti/person of god there are people that would miss you when youre gone like someone help you remember that life is worth living,0
the stigma will always be there im afraid,0
lexapro (escitalopram) is an ssri antidepressant that can also help associated anxiety like any medication it will take time to see full benefits as you increase dosage i would say about 2 months before full benefits start to show and gradually your generally depression and anxiety should lessen its not a drug that will immediately reduce anxiety,1
zoloft is not good i had more restless and more huge crazy anxiety,1
i knew it my psych is tapering me off of lithium to change my bipolar meds now im nervous bc lithium changed my life in 02 thank you for your feedback ,1
im 31 diagnosed at 19 every medication ive been on makes me sleepy and makes me feel like a zombie i have 3 kids i cant be sleeping all the time i do not take medication and havent for about a year now some days i struggle but for the most part ive learned how to deal with my emotions and not be on the emotional roller coaster,0
there ya go keep your mind active pm me if youd like whenever youre anxious or lonely,0
i get 2 stickers today "i survived a panic attack" and "i didnt hide in the bathroom" because i dont hide in the bathroom i hide in the house ,1
your partner has to be understanding its hard being in a relationship in the first place adding bipolar to that is even harder my marriage has been struggling a lot because of my bipolar disorder my husband tries really hard to understand and be patient but hes only human so we argue and fight but at the end of the day we still say "i love you" and kiss goodnight we know we want to be together so were willing to fight for it,0
be strong its your lifedo it for youdont scared they will help youjust sleep eat and chill in the unitthe nurses are amazing people,1
this is the truest statement ! people think depression is a joke or something that a bowl of ice cream can cheer you up its not ive dealt with depression my entire life when my dad died it was horrible & now i lost my childhood home & i just want to die i want to throw in the towel & quit depression is so hard to deal with ,0
latuda left me feeling lathargic most days but i wasnt irritable at least i hope it works well for you,0
maybe rhodiola rosea i cant believe your doc is allowing you to be off meds i would find a new doc stopping meds is dangerous i agree that mj could help but be sure to get the right strain so your anxiety isnt worse good luck to you,1
there you go derek pritchard its a horrible job in the mist of the thunderstorm but if not for the lighthouse how could i ever navigate through the seai never learned astrology,0
it sounds like you may be lonely too try reaching out to someone to do something with work with your therapist to figure out why you are depressed and having anxiety you may want to go back to the hospital to get your meds changed up if you are feeling suicidal i have been through all of the above its constant work sometimes to feel good if i relax to long i back slide one of the biggest things for me is being happy with my self i am me and that is ok!! i have chronic mental heath issues i have chronic physical issues im shy my husband of 20 years dumped me for a new model but i am learning that i am much more than these things i have my good days and bad days i will forever be a work in progress i hope you are feeling better keep us up to date on how you are doing,0
my fiance and i both have anxietyi have depression with anxiety his anxiety is daily and constant and makes him question our relationship and makes him repeat the same things over and over my depression makes it impossible for me to get out of bed talk move or even move my eyes its difficult but communication is key i hope a therapist can help you im considering getting one for me and my fiance,1
users and obnoxious men are the ones putting themselves out there cus they know what they want if an insecure woman doesnt feel wanted she wont notice you when you do dont be obnoxious but speak up and be honest i prob wouldnt be the only woman who would appreciate it if the nice guys stood up once and a while,0
the only advice i have is watch for mania since you have just been manic antidepressants can cause mania im on wellbutrin 300mg and it works well for me but im bp2 i also take buspar 10mg three times a day for anxiety and in the past i have been on lamictal,1
this is what ive done with all three pregnancies i stop my meds cry all the time and try to deal with it then once baby is born go back on medication id hate to risk unintentionally​ hurting my baby by taking an antidepressant,1
ive tried mmj but it didnt help me at all it was a strain for insomnia and depression and it helped neither,1
i have taken both seroquel caused me rapid excess weight gain (40 lb over 2 months) vistaril (hydroxyzine) did not help with my anxiety,1
first off you need to report your boss nobodyand i mean nobodyin the authoritive position should be using words of profanitymuch less belittle any employee go as high up the chain of command until you find someone who will listen and investigate it record it and send it via email if you have to as for youre seeing a therapistgo i cant stress that enough its not anyone around you whose life is at jeopardy its yours!!!! you need professional help there should be some kind of hotline for crisis you can call on yourself if not go to the emergency room please do this for yourself your life matters and you matter get some help now i am not a cutter but i do understand as i know people who have cut on themselves the feeling of trying to escape from the pain inside only to project that pain on the outside as a means of escape you can message me any time you need to just get that help you are desperately crying out for before its too late,0
as already stated it can be hard to come off of it its probably good youre increasing dosage gradually as already mentioned the withdrawal can be awful also please carefully read all of the side effects if you have some of the scarier side effects happen please have a supportive friend or family member on speed dial you might also consider healthy snacks like chocolate covered nuts if youre not allergic these may help a little with mood but are not a substitute for medication dosage modification should be done by the doctor with all of your experience with the medication disclosed,1
i stopped taking medication i learned that you control youre own feelings you want to be sad so be it if you want to be happy then be happy stop dwelling on the past its behind and done with focus on today and look forward to tomorrow! all these medications are killing you slowly anyways hell if you read the side effects to all of them youll notice 99% of these things say causes depression so youre depressed and your going to take a pill that has a side effect of depression? youre going to let some little pill control your life!? it took me 2 years to get off seroquel due to the withdrawals i had i was dependint on some little pill to make me happy and sleepy now im off it feeling amazing! and losing weight! damn thing turned me into a over sized watermelon now i know not everyone is the same blah blah blah bullshit dont make an excuse if i can find happiness than so can you! if you realllllllly need to take something for youre aneixty then smoke a little weed if its illegal in youre state or country who cares get that shit! its hell of a lot healthier then those pills mind you this is my opinion so dont get all youre panties tied up in a bunch and attack me :),0
i have been diagnosed with the same bipolar 2 and boarder line personality disorder i dont tell people i know about it as i am afraid they will stop being my friend,0
i watch my daughter go through this and its the hardest thing a parent can do they tell me that you cant fix all the things wrong it sure hurts no insurance no medications just a day to day struggle,0
oh dear my friend i feel so badly for you all i can tell you is about me really im prescribed lorazepam and i stagger it in the evening for anxiety i take a mood stabilizer lithium 3x a day and another mood stabilizer at night that is good for anxiety called zonisamide maybe ask your doctor about these drugs because my anxiety is under control good luck!,0
i manipulate have all my life bipolar and anxiety i was only girl in my family among 6 grandkids the youngest spoiled i have to gave my way i do feel love i over love part of ocd,0
what are you on these for? anxiety and depression? it takes at least 6 weeks to kick in still a mood stabilizer like lithium that handles both very well might be the better way to go slow release tablets 900mg a day 3 x 300mg tabs,1
i have to comment i am a suicide surviverwhen you have reached that deep dark place you do not think of your childreni have 3 they never even entered my mind i just had an overwhelming need for peace in my headyou do not think rationally otherwise the devastation you will leave behind will stop you doing itno one wants to diethey just want peace,0
guilt so powerful,0
its terrible hey i have general anxiety i wake up  theres anxiety flowing through my body anxious about going to the store to being anxious that someone peed on the toilet seat i almost lose my mind,1
no problem! i take a mg supplement with my meds just fine -its an element that the body naturally needs and it helps muscle tension and constipation (by loosening the digestive tract - one common product is milk of magnesia used to treat constipation it is in the hydroxide form it also draws water from the intestines which helps soften feces and make them easier to pass) i also do a mg regime after a hard conditioning workout for hockey or after a long training run it helps alleviate some of the soreness the next day epsom salt baths are particularly good for this purpose (i actually use it in an ice bath to cut down the inflammation same as you would with a cold pack but for my entire body instead of a localized area) the us rda on it is 400-420 mg per day for men about 300 for women it comes in several different forms among them glycinate citrate and oxide i i know there is a minor contraindication with xanax and magnesium oxide but it is very rare considered to be clinically irrelevant some forms will mess with the gut more than others - i cant take citrate but glycinate is good for me it is in my vitamin regimen with the blessing of my doctor even though i take an insanely high dosage and my body tolerates it well (more than you ever needed to know about mg im sure! but its one of my staples for several issues) also you cant really overdose on it - whatever the body cant use it will excrete,1
youre absolutely welcome i just started a new great job myself and i was terrified the first couple of weeks lol im still terrified everyday i go plus im about to go back to school again for the fall semester which adds to the stress but my medications help get me through i hope you find the right medicine for you i know just doing that is such a stressful and tiring process one of the medicines i took on my journey to finding the right ones made me produce breast milk and i was 15 at the time but remember you are resilient i dont know who you are but i can already say you are strong because you fight the monsters too along with trying to live your life you will make it through to the other sidestronger ,0
you are beautiful and you are worth something you have to focus the need to cut on something else hun i carnt say it will get better because every situation is different but you can manage it with help and a good support network depression runs in my family and it was unspoken about for years at it was seen as shameful but now its better because we talk openly about it my mother my sisters myself and my sons and daughter have all self harmed and its hard to talk about it i hope you find some light in your darkness and hope you can get help maybe some professional help hope it helps to know you are not alone and it can be hereditary  thoughts are with you i get that when you bleed the emotions are being released thats called blood letting you can be brutally honest with me as nothing phases me its not disgusting its a coping mechanism although a dangerous one we are all here for you whenever you need us,1
i really feel for you as i have had a similar experience was being treated for years for major depression ptsd anxiety i was on a shit load of medication and then i moved to a new state seeing a new psychiatrist who diagnosed bi-polar and started me on new meds but at the same time weaned me off the old ones i actually feel much better and have not had to be admitted into hospital for over a year which is a miracle for me i spent 10 long years in and out of hospital having long bouts of electric shock therapy and my body so pumped up with drugs that i literally could not move i wasnt living i was just existing seek other opinions from independent psych if you can i truly wish you all the very best on your journey to better mental health care ,1
sometimes its necessary there is no sense in struggling through life when there are things out there that can help you live a more fulfilled life!! good luck my friend!! im here if you need an understanding ear! plus ill be graduating in may with a degree in psychology & certification in crisis intervention,0
could be meds or from anxiety try supplements that help calm like ashwaghanda,1
suicide ideation can be extremely scary for a person especially as the thoughts can be very vivid and often out with persons control it doesnt neccessarily mean that the person is going to attempt suicide - although not always case and i have in the past but mostly they are a reflection of persons emotional distress ive had times when these thoughts and images have been almost been unbearable i try and distract myself doing something physical to get through unfortunate ly doesnt always work and i have resorted to self harm at times but not as frequent as before,0
i always say that dealing with my bp2 and anxiety is like fighting a three-headed beast you never know where to start fighting,0
why would they put you on gabapentin for stress and depression?? its a painkiller as far as i know and a strong one! it can have serious mood effects for some people one person i know ended up not being able to take it because he got really angry and lashed out on it the electric shocks you are having are a side effect of one of the pills you are taking and means that one of them isnt agreeing with you - you need to get off it and/or try something different this symptom is not normal nor should you tolerate it you could end up sicker i usually only got electric shocks when coming off them as a withdrawal symptom but i know others who got it while taking them and they had to change meds asap,1
i fight it every day april i only go to work and store because o have to really dont want to leave the house tried so many meds didnt work xanax is helping a little but tried to avoid that drug my next step is to see psychiatrist im thinking try to stay strong i know it is so hard ,0
i understand you fully judi it soured rather awkward,0
sounds like anxiety,1
i lost 180 lbs after my divorce i lost 30 lbs and 150 lb man when i became happy again i gained 30 lbs back not sure if its the meds but it is horrible,0
the same way you did because i feel the same way and do the same thingsalthough i was never allowed to have friends in my previous marriage making new ones is harder for me because im afraid i wont be accepted with my problem,0
i was terrified of telling my boyfriend but i did and expected the worst however he laughed and said well i had already guessed with the way your moods are so i hadnt done a very good job of hiding it after all needless to say he now reads up on how to cope with a bi polar girlfriend and he loves telling me new things he learns from the reading up on it just tell him im sure your anxiety will decrease substantially as well once your open and honest i know mine did x,0
this would drive me crazy it would make my anxiety worse!!!,1
struggling to do things people consider normal on a daily basis is tiring af eugh anxiety u cunt!,0
admin please delete anyone making deliberate unhelpful comments or potentially dangerous comments in this case ahmed & jen please remove them i like many others seek this page out everyday (even though i may not always comment) i totally relate & find it so very valuable this page is a place of support & non judgement where its safe for the poster to be open & seek advice to this poster honey ive been there too nothing good ever comes of cutting ever be open with someone you trust please start to build a new friendship group it is possible it is these people your calling friends are nowhere to be seen right now in your time of need are they right? life can begin as many times as you like but to save yourself the pain of starting over & over seek out the assistance you need now i sincerely wish you the best & dont be afraid to post updates or ask for more advice if needed xx,0
i am diagnosed with ptsd chronic depression social anxiety disorder and bipolar but my meds keep me pretty stable i havent been at all today,1
i had similar experience she and i were close for more than a year but that was it--close yes we knew each others feeling she admitted she loved me but she didnt wanna go further like commitment she told me she had a boy who came to her house almost everyday and her parents seemed to like him she was afraid to hurt me if we were coupled although we didnt have official relationship but it still hurt me i expected too much because its hard sooooo hard to get a girl in a country which homophobic then she suddenly disappeared no trace at all my heart was broken so i think its better for you to make it clear with your girl what do you want how do you feel about her at least you help yourself to get an answer about the relationship between you two i found it easier to go on or even to let her go after we opened our minds and talked about it you need to say how you feel i dated 20 girls (yes i was a player once) and most of them needed certanty about the feelings,0
im sorry you are in this its not a relationshipits an unhealthy toxic co dependency leave walk away no excuses if hes a narcissist he will do all he can to manipulate you to stay this cd be the turning point in your life when you learn to become your own best friend & put yourself first its ok to have your fears but dont let them dictate your actions and keep you in it may you have miraculous solutions and the support you need,0
yes i am bipolar pills didnt work i now take a pill for pain and a pill for anxiety they make me look like an addict and people judge me but now i am able to function like a semi healthy person most days,1
there is so much help out there so by taking the first step and asking for it you have started on a journey of hope from personal experience i know its not a short journey but the doctors/ psychiatrists know how to help you so dont feel anxious about meeting them you dont have to deal with this alone so all the best,1
because im suppose to be on neurontin for my nmo (which is an autoimmune disease like ms but worse) i am also bipolar have depression & anxiety,1
hi yes i have experienced the sleep paralysis on this drug it lasted about 2/3 months on & off the events are so real you would swear on the oath that these events you where feeling or hearing are real the realness is unbelievabley real & increased in severity to the point that i was worried about going to sleep then all of a sudden they stopped & i havent had an episode for about 4 months now but when they are happening it was one off the scariest things i have ever gone through,1
but it can also lead to psychotic symptoms and thats a scary thing so i wouldnt advice what you are suggesting,1
o how i can relate!! i too went threw this same exact scenario! watch my alcoholic step dad beat my mom when i was a small child! till this day im told its untruei know what i saw!! ive always been told anything that i remember as a child its just my imagination!! its horrible to think the one person in life that birthed you tells you ur pretty much delusional! ive learned to detach myself from my upbringing for i thought and was made to feel it was all a lie! hope you find peace with it!,0
no easy answers - you do whats best for you dont expect them to understand dont care if they do its where self acceptance comes into play and since ive learned it i have blown off some and went to others why ? because i know it comes down to my decision not what others expect or want me to do  i lied with someone for 4 years that wanted me at every little event as they were very outgoing this was 3-5 times a week i literally made myself miserable and "broke down" because i wasnt meeting "their" expectations when i realized i only have to meet my own expectations and gauage them on how i feel i am progressing it has been night and day truly i go to way more things now then ever have before thats not to say its a lot but it is the very important things i also dread them far less and typically enjoy myself athough of course the smaler the get together the better lol ,0
it sounds like anxiety to meits the symptoms,1
suffering from bipolar most of my life has been one hell of a ride i have scars it does make me laugh when someone is sad because its a monday they go to the dr and poof theyre bipolar drs are passing that out like its candy big pharma likey i dont wear my heart on my sleeve but i have lost a lot of friends and family due to my illness its not fun to be manic and out of control to only cycle to a depression that tears at your inner being hopeless and afraid dont shower or shave dont turn on my phone staying inside my homethen im good again the rollercoaster never ending heightened anxiety with fits of rage here i am in my cage people scoff at me thinking im fineits all in my head well yea! it is in my head! intermittent explosive im sorryalways im sorry its my fault when its not i recede into my darkness and wallow in my mire,0
i hope it all works out for you i am new to this page a few years ago i had a meltdown at my job and threatened suicide thank goodness it was a human services agency and they understood that shit but i was out of work for a month and in a psych ward for a week it is only within the last 6 months i have my diagnosis i dont know if i will ever find the real me again sorry to go off in a different direction but you arent alone i had to give up records too hugs and good luck,1
im just a little confused diagnosed for 19 years graduating grade 12 were u a newborn when u were diagnosed or did i misunderstand something?,0
sue furst - i had no idea what you endured! i wish i would have known - we have been dealing with natashas struggle with depression and anxiety luckily she us doing very well right now i love susie q!,0
im definately having problems with my emotions and a headache that keeps getting worseany stimulation at all overwhelms mehiding in my room,0
i have bp level ii as well my wife keeps telling me to get out and try to exercise (of course with no luck since depression and stress tell me to just stay inside) to be honest the only advice i can give is: dont do anything (if possible) that could cause you to go into a mania (since manias lead to depression at least for me) and try to avoid any stimulant such as caffeine are you in school? i know for me my online classes really cause me a ton of stress even though i make a mountain out of an ant hill oh and maybe you should try to find a self help website such as mood gym,1
o god yes i started gaining on zoloft kept gaining on lexapro and didnt stop until i started wellbutrin ive gained almost 45 pounds altogether its horrible,0
that is part of anxiety and depression we always over analize and we let get to us because we hold it in til we finally blow also things that seem small to others is a bigger deal to us because our coping skills have changed and things just will happen just take a deep breath and do one day at a time!,1
you can only do so much for someone before you finally throw your hands in the air it may be difficult more so because they are married but i can only imagine her stress to take all this on plus their unstable son eventually she has one option at the end of the road which is to take care of their son and herself as he wont do it with her might sound cold but ive been there with guys who are unsavable i havent been married but as a woman struggling with bipolar and depression i had to walk away there wasnt much more i could do for them i had to take care of myself before i hit rock bottom with them,1
no secrets here eat healthy food avoid alcohol caffeine and tobacco,0
i have been told all i could take was zoloft im 7 months pregnant and have been on zoloft for a while doctor recently upped the dose for me since i was getting bad again i have a mild bi polar disorder depression anxiety and ptsd zoloft keeps me stable right now,1
listen everyone is different how they are with things with bi-polar for genuine then you must take medication to stop this horrid horrid feelings and panic attacks you get if you do not take them ive had the lot nightmares every night and disorientation when i never had meds deep depression horrendous anxiety but when i found the right meds i was feeling great so dont start throwing these meds away its dangerous if you feel ok without meds well you havent got genuine bi-polar or any genuine mental illness i followed what my psychiatrist said and never looked back,1
there is an imbalace you need your meds if you are having adverse side effects tell your doc if youre taking them irregularly youre still not getting that balance you need! mental illness is not easy and its so hard to force yourself to take your meds and no they are not a cure all its not like theyre magically gonna make everything better but theybwill help you jave a more focused valuable life! understand non mentally ill ppl do not know our struggle we are giving them a war! listen to their needs as well as yours but always take care of yourself!,0
shes the one who said she was afraid her kid would be taken away so i assumed the dad is not there and from what was written it seems she can have the meds if she goes to an appointment but she cant afford to go to the appointment ie no car or no gas money which is why i suggested medical transport we have it in mi but i do t know about other states we also have your ride which is similar but you have to pay for it and its like 2 bucks,0
ive had many people doubt i am bipolar some doubt bipolar is really even a thing i know the truth and have to be satisfied with that it hurts i share posts on mental illness in the hopes they can better understand its a struggle,0
i have and been denied twice now and my mom it took almost 6 years for her to get hers to qualify you have to see a dr at least once a month and the dr has to say that you unable to work for whatever reason anxiety ptsd whatever and thats the main thing because they will suggests different jobs that they think youll be able to do like answering the phone or filing paperwork stuff that seems easy or manageable for them so get a lawyer and make sure you have all your medical records especially anything staying you cant work good luck,1
please leave make a list of what you need to do and follow it one step at a time toxic people around you need to be gone from your life without guilt and then eventually you start to feel better and positive people will find you so you can start taking care of you you are important and its harder for you to move on but it will be awesome to have breathing room you have to take care of yourself,0
i would always much rather be manic than depressive but when im manic im very irritable and honestly just a bitch but im trying my best to calmly tell myself im over reacting,0
could your daughter maybe invite him for a sleepover giving you chance to talk to him and get help? i imagine if hes gay and afraid to tell his parents that hes feeling very alone and could make a huge difference to know he does have support and people that care x,0
i avoid people and conversation because of that,0

they are doing studies now and saying taking a probiotic daily is good for depression anxiety and order mood disorders - a healthy gut keeps the immune system happy and also helps with the seratonin levels - kids with autism as well its worth trying i think,1
i dont know you i have no idea who you are but i know one thing youre human sometimes life gets the point you just cant anymore and pain confused maybe hurt thats when you look in the mirror and you see your life is it that bad where you cant anymore or you cant take two steps reach out to help get help? this group is for you we can help you sometimes life gets to that point but i promise you its not worth it,0
yeah i dont want the world outside to exist sometimes like im trapped in my own head its hard to explain but 2 of my kids are still young & i find myself setting them up with activities to keep them busy and hiding in the shower stall crying because im so depressed and i cant snap out of it the doctors think i may have an ocd too and that feed my anxiety during my episodes the feelings of no control add to the flames of depression and i spiral out of control other days it turns me listless those days i find someone to take care of the kids so they arent contaminated by me sometimes just seeing people happy makes me depressed cause even when im happy i dont feel happy or it doesnt last sigh thank you for sharing a part of ur world it really really helps to know that others understand me even if my own family and support group dont truly understand my struggle ♡,0
i have been clean for 2 months now and ive cut for years ive stopped before but i couldnt keep that going for me selfharm was a way to quiet the war inside my head and body but i also used it as punishment now two months ago i looked at my scars and theyre bad and thought: it has been enough i dont know something clicked which i didnt have before i wanted to quit for myself and no one else but i still find it extremely difficult cause when i feel bad and i am tense my mind automatically goes to selfharm but what kinda helps me may be weird but i look at pictures of selfharm and while i do that the urge subsides and i also have a buddy system i have one person who knows about it and that i want to quit and asked her to help me in a way that i can call or message her when the urge is really strong but i find that the buddy system is a hard thing for me to do since its a huge step to ask for help and what also helpes me is that i dont want to be to harsh on myself i say to myself that its okay if i relapse someday that might happen it kinda takes the pressure away a bit that helped me when i quit cannabis too just know you are not alone and you can message me if you want to!,0
what you described is what i suffer with on a daily basis ib have rapid bipolar severe anxiety bpd and ptsdall of which can be life threatening do not stop til you find someone that will listen to you sometimes you have to go a little bat shit crazy for them to realize the severity of it thats what i had to do let your raw emotions out on them ib know that is a very vulnerable feeling to have to do but sometimes it is necessary for them to see that something really needs to be dove to help you,0
this is so true the palpitations are so fast it feels like they want to jump out of your chest its very scary,0
i like lamictal latituda did not work for me and you dont have to worry about the food thing,1
bipolar disorder is a chronic illness & is not curable there will be times in your life where its well managed & there will be times where its unstable like any other chronic illness you need to learn about it; you need to know what may trigger an episode & also the things that help to make it easier to live with [for me] i found group therapy and peer support helped me to realise i wasnt the only one living with bpd and then to accept that to live my best life i had to take some responsibility for staying well it was my job to: ☆nourish my body with quality food ☆take medication ☆exercise regularly ☆get enough sunlight there will be times i can do all of these things & times where i find them a challenge having at least one person who truly gets your illness is imperative; you need to be able to vent & unload when youre struggling & also have someone to prompt you to reach out if youre not coping give yourself time to get your head around it all - mental illness is not for the faint-hearted you will discover you are stronger than you think you are blessings ,0
i also had to sign that form but i didnt mind takes the stress off menow i dont have to explain the psychologist can do that but they are not allowed to speak to my psychiatrist she doesnt want to,1
i have anxiety disorder i got diagnosed last month,1
i am up most nights as i have anxiety about going to bed i hate lying there and not being able to sleep so instead i stay up until i am so tired i am almost sick and then get some sleep most days i dont to bed till 5am or later sometimes it isnt till the afternoon like tonight i havent gone to bed yet and it is after 7am,1
my anxiety has been thru the roof my spouse and i havent been getting along,1
i only like it because i can relate like life could be so much worse and i actually have a nice life and amazing loved ones so why do i feel this wayand it really does make you feel guilty,0
shy acosta upper right star ,0
its absolutely correct face your fears the opposite will keep you from ever moving forward,1
you should go see a doctor dont be scared you need the help its okay your not alone,1
yeah i get that true i know what its like to feel alone and knowing that im not is certainly helpful just some are a bit much but it also comes from fear of having a loved one take it wrong guess ya cant win mental illness just sucks but i get what your saying as well,0
you will never trust him again! every time his phone bleeps or hes slightly late you will feel worst ! and already suffering with anxiety do you feel you can handle it ? z,0
i cant i avoid as much as possible lately its been a combo of latuda valium neurontin seroquel (evil drug which i am stopping today after i talk to my psychiatrist at my appointment) and alcohol i do little to nothing i was exercising but got too depressed to do that im going to address all this today with my psychiatrist except the alcohol part hell take away my valium if he knows im drinking the seroquel turns me into a zombie its supposed to be for sleep i sleep for 2 hours then wake up and eat like a pig and just lie there until i fall back asleep been sleeping from 4am to noon every day that needs to change too,0
i cant even describe to you how much i understand hospital visits oding stopping meds altogether giving up on yourself ive been through all of that too i dont know if i have any advice for you as im still struggling but i just want you to know that you arent alone hun <3,0
i was on 250mg if i missed one pill i would lose my shit id be emotional snap very easily id eat a lot more that day id just be a total mess ive been needing to start them again but im to scared of going through the first week with them settling in now i have a son,0
i have all ready said to much and now i am going to try and keep my mouth shut and see which works for me the best crying and yelling ruined my 17 year relationship and we are trying to to work on fixing it and counsling is helping but i feel better not yelling and sceaming everytime i am upset so maybe keeping my mouth shut will work for me i hope !!!! wish me good luck,1
i have taken it since august 2000 twice ended up in hospital due to toxic poisoning this last time cold turkey high dose and just had it stopped not "weaned off" as should be awful side effects literally felt electric shocks all over inside body then painful after shower drying myself skin so much pain felt sleepy really dopey feeling like spaced out! scary didnt feel in control at all! off altogether then restarted on small dose for just over a week then dose doubled and some symptoms came back so now back to low dose!!! extremely important to get bloods checked properly mine werent and ill through no fault of my own!!,0
i lost weight on abilify i gained 150lbs on geodon zyprexa and seroquel over a 3 year period ( taking these meds at different times) my abilify dose goes from10 to 20 mg depending on time of year and other factors i have been on abilify now for 7 years i am much more functional now side effect wise i tend to get nauseous very easily as well as an upset stomach and intestinal issues which my pdoc said may be the abilify,1
anxiety attacks are not only about fear,1
fortunately for me i dont usually have those i get obsessive thoughts sometimes but again all things i try to manage i have a good relationship with my dr and i communicate with him if i start to feel off everyones symptoms manifest differently,0
i sorry you have been suffering you probably have bipolar 3 where you dont see thing  you have extremely high where your funtional then you have a drop a low of a period of depression it goes up and then it goes down you need to be on a ant- depressant for a period of time enough time for it to work  we as a society take ton of meds but when it comes to mental illness we refuse to take anything bc your afraid it will make you look weak or be judged the all person by that is judging is our self bc that what are mental illness does to us your fine  you will feel better soon our brain tricks us constantlyi had clinical depression anxiety ptsd bipolar 3 obsessive complsive desorder  for years i lied to my self and refused the help because i had my highs but we i got therapy meds and tried everything to read up on the illness i began to be consistent  i get accupunture and  massagetherapy emdrmedsi workouttake vitaminjucice coffee enamas saunabath  with mental illness there is abnormal inflammation in the brian so i take omega coconut oilgingerwhite willow bark i cover my head while i take a bath to warm up my head like with a beany i meditate i tell people i have a mental illness and the dont believe it bc i so funtional dont be scared of it just try to find stuff that helps u i make art and pottery for me creating things is an outlet maybe try a new hobby i not a doctor but i hope my suggestion helped,1
am on 100mg due to depression (which is pretty much under control now) and severe social anxiety for me it dampens the anxiety down far enough that i can function i still get anxious especially out in crowds but it doesnt affect me as much as it used to before i went on medication,1
no you dont ruin every thing thats youre depression and anxiety telling you that your family wont think that at all they sound like they want to support you so let them they love you and want the best for you its very hard to see when youre not well you are very lucky to have a caring family embrace it and take strength from it when youre feeling a bit better have a think about it think how youd react if it was a member of your family that had your illness youd probably want to be there for them its difficult to see whilst youre ill fighting the demons suck to living life out of you and youre unable to think rationally like you said you feel on burden on everyone you know but were not take care i hope you have a good period soon listen to your family then x,0
you are in a manic phase of your depression and everything you have said made sense dont worry the doctor will fix it and when you do crash it will not be good i wish you well you will be fine i know your brain is racing as the previous lady said go to the er its very important you get help quickly,1
im so sorry you are going thru this i have bipolar 2 also and anxiety for ten years and have been married for 13 years my husband will say sometimes i want my debbie back this hurts because ive never stopped being debbie just now i have a battle everyday living with this disease but that is the catch you have it and you have to do what is best for you no matter who does not understand a big part of mental illness is doing what is necessary to help control the symptoms i will pray you find peace for you and your bf put please take care of you first,0
so he haves a plan to kill us all that still does not solve all our problems while we wait for the death to finally come around anxiety happens god is not an answer,0
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page i thank you very much for having a support page very helpful even to me !!,1
hes an absolute shithead! if only he knew what it feels like to have anxiety of depression such a selfish man thinking of himself maybe he should try helping you a bit & being there for you x,1
when im not manic im quite stubborn and tend to do what i want but when im manic i become unmanageable no one can tell me anything i zone out lose all sense of right and wrong throw consequences out of the window and make a ton of trouble i get very aggressive with anyone who says anything to me i must admit i have never been aggressive in any way towards a child or an elderly person i usually zone in on someone who i see as a physical challenge or threat and then let loose since i did my dbt course its got a lot better i still go manic and the urges to destroy and hurt are still there but im better at controlling them and recognizing them before its too late and i seek help before it gets to a damaging point like now ive been manic for a few weeks now and as much as i want to hurt someone the worst ive done is have verbal arguments i saw my doctor yesterday and she wants to start me on lithium to help stabilize my mood,0
i raised 4 sons alone i will never say it was easy but it can be done dont be with someone that doesnt see your value and your worth just because your struggling with a disease you didnt ask for hell probably end up being a lousy father anyway with thinking like this,0
i love cymbalta im still on 30mgs was supposed to bump up to 60 mg but since i moved out of state (from the state where dr gave me the script) i havent been able to bump up and im sort of worried to cause im only 114lbs and dont wanna end up overdosed,0
get back to a doctor and get on medication tell them how you feel on meds but taking medication to help keep your stability is nothing to be ashamed of it is reality and you are not alone hugs and prayers,1
ask for help!!! even if its just one friend assigned a visit each day to help and be there for you emotionally its hard enough being alone with a baby without a mental illness i have bipolar ptsd gad social anxiety ( which i know makes it hard to be around people) but you need help right now wish i lived close to you i would be there for you ❤️ if youre not on your meds because youre breastfeeding you need a support person looking out for you xxx,0
its ok ive been there before i doubted my friends and their love for me it turns out they didnt know what to say and were trying to give me space i had a talk with them that if they dont hear from me one day that is ok two days and they all contact me that way im reassured that they care how long have you been on your meds? it takes 2-3 weeks for them to be fully effective i would still touch base with your doctor to make sure your medication is ok,0
i have bipolar one adhd and anxiety,1
i wish my so could understand thisbecause there is no physical reason for my panic it isnt realin his opinion anyway :(,0
i take 1 mg xanax 4 times a day been on it 23 years i am a recovering alcoholic i want to get off it but afraid to!!!,0
i dont struggle,0
it hurts but usually if its a good hospital it helps a lot if you cut yourself you going husband can take care of horse for a few days if i didnt have 200 things to do i think id admit myself ups and downs hate living but my family is everything depressed severely or manic and confused,0
nobody knows who i really am i never felt this empty before and if i ever need someone to come along whos gonna comfort me and keep me strong? we are all rowing the boat of fate the waves keep on coming and we cant escape but if we ever get lost on our way the waves would guide you through another day far away im breathing as if i were transparent it would seem i was in the dark but i was only blindfolded i give a prayer as i wait for the new day shining vividly up to the edge of that sea nobody knows who i really am maybe they just dont give a damn but if i ever need someone to come along i know you would follow me and keep me strong peoples hearts change and sneak away from them the moon in its new cycle leads the boats again and every time i see your face the ocean heaves up to my heart you make me wanna strain at the oars and soon i can see the shore oh i can see the shore when will i see the shore? i want you to know who i really am i never thought id feel this way towards you and if you ever need someone to come along i will follow you and keep you strong and still the journey continues on quiet days as well the moon in its new cycle shines on the boats again i give a prayer as i wait for the new day shining vividly up to the edge of that sea and every time i see your face the ocean heaves up to my heart you make me wanna strain at the oars and soon i can see the shore we are rowing the boat of fate but the waves keep attacking us but isnt that still a wonderful journey? arent any of them a wonderful journey?,0
effexor gave me horrible side effects i now have lasting tremors because of it,0
lithium olanzapine and mirtazapine but please i cant stress enough the way a person reacts to a medication differs from person to person it is a very personal thing all medications have side effects i have just found a combo with side effects i can cope with,0
im on 20-40mg propranolol twice a day for a minor hand tremor which my doctor and i believe is related to my ptsd and anxiety and so far its seemed to help with minimal side effects im also on 150mg effexor in the morning; 400mg epilim twice a day 75mg mirtazapine at night 10-30mg endep at night and 25-50mg seroquel at night,1
yep i had all but uncontrollable muscle movement it really messed up my life and ive been trying to rebuild whats left of it my old psych pushed so hard for me to be on it,0
thank you all for your help and advice its nice to know there are people in the same position as me maybe when i next meet with my doctor i wont be as nervous to mention it as im clearly not the only one  i never wanted to go to the doctor trying to self diagnose myself because of the stigma attached to mental health but i figured if i just tell my doctor these minor details about myself she can point me in the right direction x,0
cant live your life in fear girlyy,0
ive been on wellbrutin as well and think i need it changed ive had depression and anxiety all my life you just have to have faith and yes find another dr you can trust i know its hard but dont ever give up it will get better❤,0
those feelings are normal you are scared and feel alone those will pass i hope all goes well for you,0
you need to involve your mom in your treatment my mom/family didnt get it until i took took them to family counseling and to group counseling specifically for families dealing with someone with my disorder you cant be upset if they truly know nothing about whats going on if they knew then they could see how great youre doing,0
*offers hugs* if you were doing okay on your meds before you became pregnant i dont think you should worry too much about changing them until a few months after the baby comes lets not forget that with pregnancy comes massive shifts in your bodies hormones that could easily account for the increase in bad days after your hormonal levels have returned to a somewhat normal rate then would be a good time to reassess your medication ,0
i dont think anyone really understands how strong you are you are the ones who struggle daily to get out of bed and face the day and even those days you stay in it is a fight keep fighting you are true warriors,0
thank you for posting on my post! im just so nervous the last time i was put on anything was zoloft & it pretty much made me almost kill myself! it gave me horrible thoughts,0
im going through the consequences now i know how you feel i seem to push people awayafraid theyre going to leave or give up on me anyway ive learned a lot about myself being a loner though but if its friends you seek have you tried talking to any of them some of them may have been waiting on you to say hello you may have burned a bridge but whats torn down can be rebuilt with time effort patience and love,0
you are doing the right thing and you will be alright dont be scared its not as bad as you would think im sending many blessings to you,0
please dont do anything at this moment i had 3 suicide attempts and i survived all of them one of them i was revived one of them a tree caught me and the other one the gun didnt go off everything gets better ive seen my daughter grow up to be a excellent young lady and if my life wouldve ended earlier i wouldnt of got to experience motherhood relationships marriage i also have would not of been enjoy the wonderful moments in my life that i wouldve missed if i was not here my parents wouldve never recovered from that and they wouldve had a void in their heart for the rest of their life because nobody can live without their parents or their children so live at least one breath at a time one day at a time theres always help theres medications theres therapies theres natural remedies i could give you a whole list of things medication adjustments im not a doctor but a lot of things have worked to me i would i had inside he disorder every 30 minutes a day i finally found the right doctor they gave me the right prescription and i havent had one in seven years if you wouldve told me back then that i would not have any in in anxiety i wouldve not believed you and said leave me alone i have left a handwritten letter before the paramedics revived me the look on my moms face and being a life at that moment made me realize how much damaged i wouldve caused damn good your parents like you regardless of your debt and all the stuff the thought you put them through they will forget everything you put them through i am a parent now and there is nothing that would stop me from loving my child even if my child was a a criminal nothing you can do in this lifetime could make your parents not love you so please once again asked them for help i thought the same thing when i was in a parent that i have put my mother through enough but she never stopped helping me and she never stop believing that i could get better even when i could not believe it myselfthere is no burden for a parent you are not a burden ill be your parents theyll be more gladly that you reached out to them then you take your life there is nothing that your parents would do for you for you that would cause him any discomfort as a parent we might not react in the best way in certain situations but we are always there willing to help whatever you need we always need our children you need to see other doctors and change,0
when i wasnt medicated i usually got so mad that id usually go and punch a steel locker to avoid punching others i left multiple deep fist shape dents in the steel broke my knuckle a few times one time my knuckle was swolen for a month its very dangerous for me to not be medicated one wrong word and id kill someone,0

be honest with him he can be a big help once he knows the problem believe me he has already noticed your swings and anxiety he needs to understand why also hugs and kisses are a fantastic medicine for you when he understands this came from my doc decades ago god helps tremendously also,1
thanks for your bravery i too feel like you im coming up on the end of my life expectancy and am scared as well i remember however that its just a best guess live to the fullest every day works for me i hope you find peace my friend,0
have your md check your thyroid including t3 and thyroid antibodies dont let them just check tsh and t4 autoimmune hypothyroidism is common in women and also occurs after giving birth it can cause depression and fatigue also have you doc check for the mthfr mutation if you have it you may need methylated b-vitamins because you body cant use the normal ones very well b vitamins are important to the nervous system google both these things and decide for yourself,1
thats nice! i have an amazing husband that has accepted and embraced me the way i am! i have sever anxiety depression and bipolar! i cant take many meds as i breastfed our daughter and none of the ones that are safe work right! she was manage without meds most the time! if he wasnt so understanding i dont know where i would be right now,1
i have an emotional support dog he was my dog for 4 years then i got really depressed and so i noticed he really helps me when i dont feel to great he cuddles me licks my hand( i know gross) he just tries to make me happy and it really helps so i registered him and he was trained to sit come shake high five give kisses and go away already because of his age and working with him a lot i highly suggest it for anyone with depression or any anxiety he helps me with both hope this helps,1
i can agree that a situation or a set of experiences is so jacked up that doing anything feels like like we are putting band aids on cancer i really do get this ive been plagued by this i often wished that depression would stop my heart and the lights would go out one last time the only resolution for this new year was go to war with my diagnosis no real choice alone last christmas day and felt cornered by the black snarling dogs of major depressive disorder i guess i snapped if i was going to take some punches i was certainly going to throw some from here on out it started with a written plan for the rest of my life step 1 get out that lumpy bed and wash myself that was a victory for me any progress i have made this year boils down to a three step process acceptance of the naked truth that the world is the way i find it careful choices about what i love to see happen taking action amidst great friction and discomfort im actually fighting now after years of being dormant,0
alarm clock always works for me,0
have had so many meds ive lost count each one has their own side effects over the the las ten years after a psychotic episode and being diagnosed bipolar anti depressants make me high as a kite but it only took psychiatrist 9 years to come to that conclusion now im now on meds that keep me on the low side of steady they keep me out of hospital but i am so depressed/anxiety that i hate waking up in the morning frightened of what mood ill be in and how im going to cope most ways also have lost all friends as i havent been fit to work for 30 years i can understand they need to move on but why cant they give me the odd phone call im a decent person and know i could never do that to them also being in and out of hospital you meet people think theyre friends and we swap phone numbers but if youre kind hearted you soon realise they only want you for what you can give them  so i now realise theyre not any good for me i havent been in hospital for 3 years and although im low i pray i dont want to go back again just wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience and cant see your way out of it xx,0
keep doing what you are doing by encouraging him to do even just a couple of things a day let him know that you are always there if he needs to talk and that there is help available if he wants it encourage him to write things down let him keep it private if he wants or tell him that if he cant talk but would let you read what he had written it would be a great way of communicating without that awkward barrier of being a teenager ~vw~,0
im finding these posts really annoying!! i am bipolar with depression and anxiety i work my ass off to be the best i can be!! rather that than spout how im up then down and get scared bla bla bla!!! i am bipolar and proud that every day i do my very best to be amazing!!! rant over,1

nightmares flashbacks panic attacks the list goes on id suggest seeing a dr if u have concerns,0
one more thing i like to add you just dont all of a sudden say i think i have bipolar or say im bipolar youre born with it its inherited thru one side of family or the other yes some get depressed sometimes your head does go nutty but this is the thing most of us i can guarantee have people in our families that have this disease also bipolar isnt like cancer where it just pops up it may seem like that to us who have this but its definitely inherited thats the the sucky part i wouldnt wish this disease on my worst enemy thanks friends for the support it took me until last year to actually not care about what others think i was embarrassed scared to death to say anything because people have said to me stop being bipolar thats what stopped me from saying anything now idc yes i am bipolar not happy about it but today i can talk about this and not feel embarrassed or ashamed good luck to all and anyone wanting to repost anything i say go for it if i can help just one person come out of their shell ive helped a million to me #livelovelaugh ,0

i took a low dose of celexa and everything was fine you have to be in a good state of mind! i think a low dose is fine you dont want to be miserable or stress the baby out with depression which can lead into worse things such as not eating and panic attacks increased heart rate or dehydration sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks if u need the medicine and its a small dose like it is i say its fine!,0
yes!!! the biggest fear of course being spider but i hate/ fear all sorts of bugs especially since i am allergic,0
take your husband to your doctor when you next go if he`s a decent doctor he should make him perfectly aware of how serious an illness this is that is nothing to be ashamed,1
in bipolar 2 it can i was told im a textbook example but its possible i have both and why not? i also have anxiety issues paranoia hallucinations scored high on an autism spectrum disorder test (unofficial but makes a lot of since) and if i didnt have bipolar disorder id most likely be a psychopath (prozac numbed all emotion so i dunno if that is how i really am or if that was just the meds),1
ziprasidone and seroquel i also have oxazepam for anxiety and imervain for sleep when i need them,1
i hate all bugs but im terrified of moths,0
love is louder then the pressure to be perfect,0
very much sounds like anxiety attacks- but would recommend you see your health care professional :-),1
have you thought maybe a relationship isnt working right now? i know it sounds shitty but maybe you should work on yourself before you have to forget about yourself and worry about making your significant other happy? its hard working on yourself and keeping a relationship happy,1
fear has two meanings ;) you can live past 25 since you say you dont actually want to give up that means there is fight in you your depression what it did it took your wings only forgetting you still have your claws ❤ fight man! youre not weak you just forgot how strong you are when life knocks you down calmly get up smile and say "you hit like a bitch" id be lying if i said i never felt suicidal i was diagnosed with ptsd depressionchronic insomnia which would cause both visual and audible hallucinations at 16 then 3 years ago diagnosed with social anxiety and panic disorder the meds i take for anxiety is lamotrigine actually fucking helped i couldnt believe it and for depression and insomnia i take trazadone for me these helped amazingly especially trazadone im on the lowest dose and only need to take half at night to sleep and ive seen much improvement with my depression but its no cure so of course my episodes sneak their way back in but im so happy i at least feel better to where i dont feel like im aching to die anymore because its just so exhausting i hope this helps a little and just know that ill be thinking of how youre doing and i care i really do wishing you the best take care,0
and you know what every morning i wake up after 15 mins my vision gets terribly disturbed i litreally see things moving where actually there is no movement at all but the only thing i know is one day it will be free of this shit,0
trying to support someone who experiences this is challenging and very sad for the person i know they want to be able to do these things but become overwhelmed by fear and anxiety as above wish i had a magic wand right now,0
its hard its a huge struggle and support and the help is so minimal even considering it is in denmark thank you so much for your encouragement all the best to you too ,0
i tried the no medication route and the anxiety became so bad that my hands and feet became freezing cold and mind my chest hurt like i was having a heart attack no more of that! i need to be medicated,1
i got news:they will not give you the meds you need when youre preggo!!the most theyre willing to go is a low dose of zoloft or prozac!nobody in my town would give me medsno matter how much i begged and cried!i had to be hospitalized several times during my pregnancy for suicidal thoughts(gave birth 7 months ago)let me tell youit was the worstmost horrifying pregnancy ive ever had!!it was a never ending nightmare i couldnt wake up out of!!i wouldnt wish that misery on my worst enemy!!!im warning you!!if you are anything like mehave been taking meds since a small childand cannot live without themdont do it!!you are in for a hellish 9 months!!,0
im on 150mg and its the only drug ive been on thst works for me withdrawals are horrible if you miss dosages though,0
i get that this is how people feel (i suffer from panic disorder/agoraphobia so i dont have bipolar but similar issues i have a close friend who suffers from bipolar and i know she is on this page some of these posts i feel need to be more uplifting and not so negative yes its the truth how bipolar minds work and i want everyone to understand how mental illness feels but this post in particular just bugs me some people who see this may depress them more i dont want my friend thinking there is no hope for her more uplifting stuff please,0
if my boyfriend would let me this would be my permanent setup unfortunately this is just through summer i love the sound of a fan and the cool air on my face especially helps in a panic attack it gives the impression you have extra air to breathe,0
your not crazy at all infact you seem quite strong you no whats wrong and you want help to support you thats a strength my sweet you sound very much like me i have just got off pregabaling which makes my speech impaired n i cant hold a sentence at all n my friends and family look at me like im an idiot not thinking its just the meds but if truth be told its crippling me not having it right now i struggle every day waking up to crippling anxiety i swapped a med sertraline for esetalopram and it worked wonders but im struggling again just keep fighting for what you need n dont stop till you get it stay safe ,0
agreed! some people are so judgemental! i was on a low dose of celexa and everything was fine sometimes the benefits of the medicine outweigh the risks i mean its be different if it was a class c medicine but she is on a low dose,0
i used to smoke but gave that up for gum i gave that up for water when im nervous manic etc i drink more water,0
my mom says shit like that to me i tend to shake my head smile say i know and then either walk away or make a joke about how god needs to stop testing me its hard to deal with people like that they just dont understand,0
for many who suffer from anxiety issues half of the ideas on this list cause anxiety & the rest are near impossible when anxious!,1
reach out to bipolar support groups and mental health education outreach programs and try to find a way to have professionals go to schools and educate adolescents who are vulnerable and susceptible to mental illness you can help prevent this from happening again sometimes its best to leave the past alone so you dont drag up old feelings and just try to pay it forward,1
yes it is horrible get off this post philtazsimmons taz or keep your mouth shut,0
i think your heart is in the right place but just sitting someone down and trying to explain such a major feeling is not just that easy i started to post how to cope with a loved one with depression/bi-polar along with anxiety my husband learned a lot from sites it may sound stupid but it is much easier for family to understand from other avenues,1
same its a miserable existence,0
chanel chartrand not to be argumentative as im sure lithium withdrawal plays a role in disassociation but it is not solely due to lithium withdrawal this is an issue i have dealt with since before beginning lithium and it was usually when my anxiety was at its peak i have definitely noticed it happens easier now of i forget my meds now that my body is accustomed to getting lithium and effexor (and other meds) on a regular basis lessening the anxiety does have the potential to help lessen dissociative spells this is just me speaking on my personal experience as we are all obviously very different and react differently to meds/withdrawal/situations smoking pot would help the anxiety and probably the nausea as well while the person gets their meds back into their system and gets leveled out also i totally agree about how quickly the lithium withdrawal can happen if your meds schedule gets off due to being sick or running out of meds it can mess you up in a heartbeat this poor person is probably hanging by a thread right now due to how the meds were stopped :(,1
i have been on it for 12 years and love it!! im still on the starter dose of 375 which works for me and being hypersensitive to medication i understand your apprehension give this one a try!!,0
i know this is going to be hard but you need to leave he is abusive he doesnt need to be physical to abuse you he is controlling you mentally by not allowing you to work through your problems and making then seem like a burden which they are not  please for your safety get out of that relationship then you can work on getting your mental under control i was almost the exact same boat(i could only like read half cuhz my ptsd from my ex) and he liked to sleep deprive me to the point i would hurt myself to try and get some sleep and then he would accuse me of doing it for attention but as soon as i left him alot if my problems ceased greatly at least to the point were i knew if got help id be able to get better  and i did and its been almost 2 years since i got away and im doing so much better two years from now i would love to hear about your progress  but my fear is if you continue this path with that man in two years i may be reading your obituary,1
ive been on seroquel for almost 10 years and i love it but the extended release are for the birds makes me feel like i have restless leg syndrome,0

horrible feeling,0
be prepared for the weird looks and the "im not looking for anything serious" excuses but you have to tell them asap otherwise they might break you out of ignorance spite or scorn they might also make you feel guilty you dont want any of that you need someone who understands or with an open-mind to accept to understand your situation these are very rare as for me i timed the people who stay 4 weeks and then they disappear completely,0
melissa hobson i doubt youd be bothered to read this but,0
i had a job when i was 18 and decided to go to school full time i crashed hard after about a week of doing both needless to say i quit both but found other things to occupy my time i volunteered at my youth group then got a very part time job nannying two girls i did that for 3 years so no shame doin what you gotta do,0
wow this all sounds disturbingly familar,0
i used to be on effexor & smoked a bit of cannabis to help anxiety but had a heart attack & quit since they changed me to zoloft iv gone from 55 kilos to 76 i dont know if its because i quit cannabis or because they put me on zoloft  i couldnt stay on effexor because it makes ur heart beat very fast which i get tacky cardia already so could not take them anymore,1
im an isolator myself anxiety & depression for over a year now i just wish to be left alone and for my friends to respect that unfortunately i think theyve forgotten about me im not ready to see them in person but it would be nice if they reached out every now & then,0
it affects us differently so dont be scared if it doesnt work for you theres always others that you could try but it could suit you fantastically so its got to be worth trying with myself i was worried at first as id tried a few other anti depressants but after trying 50mg for a few weeks i realised it was good and went up to 100mg there have been a few side affects on the way but not as bad as some others and in the long run its made a noticeable difference try it and see what happens and if it doesnt suit you then you can always try another drug,0
ive taken time off from everything in life because of mental illness including anxiety and i guess depression and other things,1
amen i am one that struggles and battles that world i know though i have seen people suffer tremendously worse than myself ,0
you dont say what your gf been diagnosed with but from what you have written sounds like bipolar difficult situation if you think children are at risk or in danger then you need to do what is best for them to ensure they ate safe you can either let her know you love her and are there to support her if that is what you want and that you will be there if and when things go wrong or you can decide to make the break unfortunately only you can make that decision sounds like its time to really think what us best for the future of your children,0
im have so much depression and anxiety but i never take any meds :(,1
just a question who diagnoses these disorders? ive usually been diagnosed by a doctor for depression and anxiety but people around me seem think i have something closer to bipolar i just want it worked out because im the same the highs are the best but the lows are super flat like i have no heart im on 150mg zoloft but its stopped working after 5 years of slowly upping the dose,1
i am bipolar 1 as well as for mei usually only want to hurt myself even when im angry with others the only exception is if i feel my wife or any of my family for that matter is being threatened if you feel like you want to hurt yourself or anyone else and youre not sure you can stop yourselfplease call law enforcement and cooperate with them if you let them know on the phone that you are bipolar and you think its due to your meds and that you are unarmedthey will treat you with compassion and sympathy i hope this helpsi am speaking my opinion based on my experiences,0
am glad you have the opposite of what happened to me never had that in my life and when i thought i might have itthe person leftinsulted me and threatened to throw me in jail i would sell my soul to get just one person from your life in mine,0

i was granted ssdi surprisingly quickly i filled out the paper work with a social worker provided by my mental health care clinic when i was getting treatment i am diagnosed with anxiety mdd and bp 2 just keep in mind disability isnt "free money" it is barely enough to cover expenses and youll still need other help with food housing and maybe even extra insurance to help with things not covered by medicare (which can be a lot) not to mention they will routinely decide that you owe fees and will withhold some of your funds this may become a larger problem with the way congress is going and can vary by state regulations,1
i have no idea what people think i dont really care but i definitely struggle every day to stay alive,0
it worked really well for the first year or two but now makes my anxiety out of control so then i had to decide anxiety out depression?,1
stay on your meds see your dr and get a good therapists im in the same boat exercise some way it alleviates depression and anxiety,1
i am confused as to what you are asking?,0
its so hard when you feel as bad as you do severe depression is all encompassing it defines you and takes over your whole life everyday is pretty much the same in terms of desperation sorrow and trying to battle the demons in your head when you are least able i remember all too clearly day after day week after week being sofa bound willing the endless days to end having no strength or drive to be able to change things or get better the trouble is recovering from severe depression involves so many things and all of which involve strategies which seem almost alien and impossible to implement it can seem such a monumental task and when the task seems so huge i think it is almost impossible to believe you can ever make it happen dont give up on that hope when there is hope there is a chance i know it can seem so far away or so difficult to find that contentment or inner peace we all crave but you can do it you ve come this far you must congratulate yourself for doing so well to get this far when your mind is leading you astray whilst i was wasting my life and just existing not living i wanted escape constantly not wanting this life but because i lived through the carnage of my closest friend and relatives suicide i knew that just wasnt the answer i wanted escape but not that i knew there had to be another way there are so many questions id need to ask about your support if you have any medication if you have access to professional services im in the uk and i suspect you are in the us and services might not be available or affordable i am no expert just someone who cares and understands able mental illness and the hideous affect it can have and the intolerance and ignorance which exists in the world i finally reached the realisation that no one else would get me off that sofa only me i had to find the determination and strength to do it i owed it to myself i came up with a plan i wasnt going to waste any more life a goal for the future some big things eg find some meaningful voluntary work some small eg sit in the sunshine many things were involved from sleeping tablets to give me a welcome respite to getting counselling so many things contributed and were necessary from trying to eat better to reaching out to loved ones admitting i needed them im not pretending it was quick and im still on the path but im now working and have a completely different life i call it my new life after depression big steps are not necessary because they are unachievable small achievable but significant steps are the ones that can work tiny goals but steps forward not back dont try to run before you can walk my aim is to write a book one day but for now i am happy to enjoy the little pleasures in life confirmation i have made it through and there is no going back best wishes thoughts and hope to you there is a better way xx,0
all i can offer is my thirst knowing what bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder are about i have the depression and hypo mania of bipolar disorder ii plus which i have chronically lived with the illnesses are simultaneously genetic disorders and environmentally influenced diseases hence psychiatric conditions being referred as either disorders or illnesses to the exclusion of the nature nurture controversy as stress and trauma impact on one with the genetic disorder of bp (environmeninfluence),1

ego ruins alot being scared and not going after what you want stops you from getting it and one sided love is usually real its just both people are so used to being hurt when something real comes along youre both scared to try anymore,0
i truly know how you feel i was recently diagnosed with bpd i also have ocd depression and anxiety how do you handle everything? i feel like im drowning half the time,0
no i am the same way sometimes i cant afford to get my meds refilled and i go off the deep end i feel so bad and my body feels so horable it is not your fault so dont worry just do the best you can,0
dont be scared go to the doctor they will help you i was the same way but i finally just couldnt cope by myself as long as i stay on my meds i feel so much better i do have some bad days still but not as bad especially with gods help also i will pray for you i care about you and know exactly how you feel if you ever need to talk just ask,0
i had a date last friday and told the guy i was bipolar and depression i know i would have anxiety and was sweating and embarrassed but he told he had a sex addiction and he is a councillor and thought i be in good handsbut the sexual advances were awful and didnt know how to react very uncomfortable and he told me might have a heart attacki was so upset so said goodbye but didnt feel good about myself at allso saying all thatit made no difference so confusing and i havent been sleeping for weeksthe next day i couldnt get out of bed and was crying all dayhe rang me and i couldnt talk to him is this normal to feel like thisso confusing and i wonder what i could had done differently,0
i enjoy that i feel more motivated and less numb but i also dread my more manic times because i make split second decisions and am often irrational and compulsive which has gotten me into trouble before,0
dont let your doc treat symptoms you just have bipolar like me anxiety and depression are just part of the game im currently on 900 mg of lithium only side affect ive noticed (been on it about 17 months now) is sometimes i feel a tad drowsy after nothing a cup of coffee cant fix though my appetite sometimes is out of whack too but i think thats more from the actual disorder then the medication cause ive always either eaten excessively or barely at all as long as i remember,0
i think you suffering from guilt and years of keeping a secret to yourself i know exactly what you going through till this day i have not opened up not even to my therapist am also in my 30s and everyday is a trying day its so difficult to exist all the best today,0
yes i have been told this before sadly by some of my own family they kinda get it now there is also an unspoken thing that other christians believe it is because of a lack of faith in god i have learned to try and avoid those people god has brought me some people who understand or at least try to understand i pray that god will send you someone like that as far as church right now idk i havent gone in a while im not exactly sure why partly sick of the masquerade pray about finding another church that will welcome you with open arms if that is what you feel led to do,0
my husband is just like you i only have depression anxiety and ptsd but he is working on understanding how my treagers for my ptsd work i have only been diagnosed with ptsd for a little over a year,1
hi  just coming out of about of anxiety and depression but had a dip yesterday and today so your enquiry had very recent meaning for me what i found helped or was at least distracting was to listen to mediations on youtube for insomnia and anxiety to at least distract myself from ruminating rumination is when you have the same things going round and round in your head they may be things you have to do should do or things you cannot do anything about but concern you sometimes it can be the littlest things or what might appear to be the silliest things go to and look under meditations see lina grace at ,1
i just started it recently does a great job as a mood stabilizer but afraid of weight gain,1

hi this post was from me just an update my gp referred me to mind mental health service i had my telephone assessment today and after forty minutes on the phone the woman told me they couldnt help as soon as i told her ive noticed ive had symptoms of mania she said she will have to consult her supervisor because they only provide therapy not diagnosis (i get that) but she thinks im not fit for their services because she doesnt think i have just got depression what happens now? im back in square one just feel upset because im getting sent back and forth ,0

its very dangerous to discuss medication with people who are not professionals but my two cents is that wellbutrin is either heaven or hell for me it was hell it gave me these episodes where it felt like my entire body was buzzing and crawling with ants or something and i couldnt sit still it was horrible but i have many customers for who it works very very well too,0
sending lots of love to you do not fear being admitted i have been there many times but i did eventually get through it all the very best to you,0
hi i was on it for anxiety and depression and its a good medication just it can have extreme side effect that you should familiar yourself with if your partner breaks out into a rash call your doctor immediately,1
i bet it will help u gosh it sure did me youll over come the side effects enough to realize the benefit ( being alive ) i take other stuff too but the paranoia and self harm help is totally credited to seriquil im not to proud to admit it saved my life big hug 2 u for what your dealing with i have been there,1

if their is no single reason behind his depression then it could be his life style he needs constant attention from family members until he has confidence to to shake off the deppresion find out what sport or interest he has and take it from there  good luck ,1
beta blockers (only blocks the physical symptoms) low dose seroquel (you will be drowsy) or buspirone (has been shown to have similar efficacy to xanax but needs to be used over a number of weeks like an antidepressant but isnt a benzo) are all good choices; id only use xanax as an extreme emergency option and use it extremely rarely (as in id keep some around and only use it when all else fails - make sure you have as many other options both medical and psychological available as well) a combination of meds may also be needed to address my anxiety flashbacks and extremely minor panic attacks i use mindfulness practice deep breathing propranolol (20-40mg twice a day) effexor (150mg in the morning) epilim (400mg twice a day) mirtazapine (75mg at night) and as my emergency medication for when everything else fails valium (25-5mg up to twice a day as needed) seroquel is also used but i use that for sleep not anxiety 25-100mg at night as needed as is my prescription,1
10 out of 10 and morethe struggle is real,0
i understand god bless you i struggle everyday as well with my grandson i love him so much i hope you find comfort he is my for living,0
seems a bit harsh to tell you youll always have them they may be part of who you are now but mental illness is a journey and you may experience changes for the better with practice and time that said emotions are never wrong they just are all you can do is choose whether or not you encourage a feeling by dwelling on it or choose to reevaluate your thought process and try to gain a different perspective suicidal thoughts are a reaction to difficult and painful feelings: you have the power to change how you react to your feelings even if you cant directly change the feeling itself your mind is plastic and regenerative thought patterns can become habitual but habits can be relearned,0
there is a gene for anxiety; namely slc6a4,1
this isnt about being exhausted its that feeling when youre so depressed you just do not want to life at all you know you accept 100% ";" you will go on but damn this sucks so fucking bad even when im not dealing with this shit im thinking about it my life will be hell for months god please can i just sleep through it its that desperation that this is talking about i was there once and ill work a great deal to keep from being there again ;,0

the withdrawals are horrible and you should never have been in that tip begin with! honestly talk to another doctor for advice about going off of it,0
i enjoy mine but it also scares the crap out of me especially knowing the crash is coming fast i between the times i dont sleep have great ideas get things done that have been looming for a long time i am also very defensive more combative and easily irritated and willing to act irrationally or run away,1
its okay at least i realized im not alone in this kind of struggle ,0
i always pretend to my family and friends because i know it upsets them but if they dont like it they dont have to read it xx,0
no  you are not the only one that suffers from the withdrawals of these damn pills  i too become a totally different person  call this complicated  hard to deal with  very easily annoyed that is created by these big pharmaceutical companies and their man made so called medication when my friends see the slightest bit of my alter ego coming out is when along with the change of myself is when my name changes as well  i then become evilalina  funny yet sad !! dealing with the aftermath of evilalina sometimes puts me into a deeper depressing state of mind i am not this irritate person i transform into which one one the main reason why i choose to medicate myself by medical marijuana  i have also knocked out 3 of my daily pills  since evilalina rarely makes her presence known,0
thats an impact tremor is what it is im fairly alarmed here,0

if you have a generalized anxiety disorder it might not be possible to come up with a reason for the anxiety or anxiety attack- i usually lose my hearing and most of my sight in a panic attack and i find the take an ice cube in each hand and squeeze method to be very effective my psychologist told me about it - just hold an ice cube in each hand tightly and it really helps i think it cools you while slowing something down and distracts your mind with the sensation once i start to come back down to earth i start repeating to myself you are here you are safe and push your feet into the floor and feel the sensation look around and notice things to remind you that you are safe in a safe place i use these they are simple and they work for helping me gain back my faculties especially,1
i totally understand im rarely evened out or middle of the road but now ive learned to sense it when it comes over me more i still get way overwhelmed but too i try to get a handle on it im on 4 meds it takes patience and lots of work to control some can never achieve peace i know ill never be at peaceprayers for you,0

i have very few friends and there is nothing wrong with that go for quality over quantity meeting new people is not a problem trusting them is so dont try to stop worrying about other people if they really dont like you they will soon be out of your life but try to enjoy their company as they pass through it some will stick around and will be willing to wait for you to "open up" in a few months/years/whatever you may actually feel different towards them and feel more trusting and secure i know it is difficult im going through this process myself but im slowly giving up a life of isolation for a life with a few acquaintances who may one day be friends and im winning as im not so isolated any more still have no friends who i totally trust but maybe that will come but as i say im already ahead by being able to join in with company start with little steps one after the other and see how far you can get,0

the longer you stay the harder it will be to eventually leave do a little research on "gas lighting" its a common way for one person to convince another that its all in their head then you feel like you are crazy that is their plan know that approximately 90% of women involved in a toxic relationship will die by the hands of their abuser at first i thought that number must be exaggerated the longer i stayed the worse it got i soon was fighting for my life on a daily basis dont beat yourself up if you arent successful in leaving multiple times the ugly truth is that the average person in an abusive relationship takes 7 times of leaving & coming back before they break free for good i was deathly afraid of my ex husband was afraid to tell anyone it sounds a lot like this abuser suffers from narcissistic personality disorder people with narcissistic personality disorder are impossible to fix this is because they dont think they have a problem the best thing to do is hoard as much money (cash) as possible start making a plan now to get away the best & only way to free yourself from a person with npd is to have no contact with the person you deserve better the cheating wont stop get out as soon as you can good luck to you dear if you need to talk to someone that has been in your shoes i welcome you to message me be good to yourself,0

i havent worked since i was diagnosed 5 years ago i did start volunteering at a local aquarium one day a week it was a stretch physically but mentally and emotionally too being around crowds interacting with strangers no down-time some days i had to retreat to the stairwell just to clear my head it got easier each time just factor in the physical stress of doing something new and know that will effect you emotionally as well,0
same for me i talked about this in another post but today my x wife is my best friend and supporter she like a lot of peoples significant others dont read up on our illness its hard for us to explain and when we do talk about this they dont think that can happen in our heads i was paranoid hearing voices seeing things thought people were watching me or following me it sucked that i lost the best thing to ever come into my life she gave me a beautiful gift tho my son youd think in todays world people would be more educated and think before they judge sad and hurtful ill never stop fighting either should anyone god bless #livelovelaugh,0

this sounds like a mixed episode were you on a mood stabilizer before you stopped taking your medicine? if you were you may be having a rebound effect it may take some time for the drug to rebuild to an effective level in your body: most psych meds arent instant do talk to your doctor asap but dont panic! i am the queen of mixed episodes and i speak from experience mixed episodes are intensely uncomfortable but they always pass! you wont feel like this forever try to sit tight keep your hands busy and fight the urge to do anything reckless or self-destructive if you feel like jumping out of your skin valerian tea is soothing and may help a bit til you can get to the doc and in the future if your meds are working stay on them! lots of luck,1

always difficult when dearling with depression and anxiety i would not suggest another diagnosis until depression and anxiety are stable once stable coaching of how to read what your body is telling you; coaching of ways to increase strength coaching for limiting drama-fears might even stablize depression and anxiety more i know someone who has stablized d & a and doesnt show any signs of bipolar today bless youbreatherslow down but sleep breathe do what you love,1
honestly in my experience you can educate people but you cant force them to accept that knowledge or not either they will try to understand or they wont and if they wont dont stress yourself out over it because thats not your fault you can only ask that they respect your boundaries and not discuss it because its an upsetting or triggering topic the old adage is true you can lead a horse to water but you cant make it drink,0

if you dont belong on this site and have no respect for others that are hurting or going through things or do not understand dark thoughts which mean many different things for many different people and yes theres some things that we just should never say out loud every single person on this planet has had many types of dark thoughts trust me but as someone with a mental illness it can be much harder to bare including just thoughts about yourself your life people in your life etc but again if you dont understand these things you probably dont belong on this site and the truth be told you may not even have a mental illness so why the heck are you on here have a little common sense and decency and find someone else to bother only people that are struggling alone and if you do struggle in your life with anything i hope people are there for you you should not judge and i am not trying to judge you but you are certainly trying to judge in what does thoughts means from a group that is all about trying to figure out their mindset and trying to heal without compassion or respect this is not the site for you!!!!!!!!!!!!,0

im on seroquel "extended release" (xr) 600 mg/day maybe its the extended release that never made me tired or feel any irritability,0
it doesnt upset me it just makes me feel alone,0
it is simply a mood stabilizer basically for me it slows my brain down enough to recognize my "illogical thoughts" or that i am in an episode when things get stressful my body still responds to it to anxiety and exhaustion is one of those things could you be going through something that is more stressful then normal? has this occurred the whole year or just in moments?,0
get bioplast its a firm plastic i used to chew mine when i was anxious right up until i chipped a tooth,1
i lost my fiancé to overdose last august he died in my arms i understand what youre feeling; that unending pain the thoughts that creep in when youre at your weakest the crippling anxiety of having to deal with anyone or anything i go to therapy sometimes 2x a week and sometimes once a month im on medication and that helped keep me from self harm and help stabilize my moods the best advice i can give is to think that even in your darkest hour youre loved one would want you to live live for them ive recently been able to smile instead of cry when i think of my fiancé i know you dont want to hear it but time takes time this is going to hurt for a very long time before it gets better some days youre going to want to call it quits in those times change your surroundings go for a walk a drive or even sir in your backyard i used to sit in a daze in my backyard staring at the stars to calm myself down keep taking your meds go see a therapist and most of all hang in there theres always a better tomorrow if we can just hang in there feel free to message me if you ever want to talk❤️,0

that is so sad im sorry my depression came to the fore around the same age but i didnt know what it was & no-one helped me tbh he really needs to speak to a doctor or counsellor its scary embarrassing frustrating at first but its so important reassure him hes not on his own and although you dont know how hes feeling you are there with him every step of the way he needs people he can talk to (maybe not even someone close) & most of all your support i hope things get better for him remember it can be chemical & not anyones fault xx,0
i did lamitcal and tomapax together for my bipolar then xanax for anxiety worked good for years but then i had a episode  now im back to trying to find right combo,1

i have a friend that always used to say "fine" when hospitalised for depression in group therapy sessions finally the therapist said she couldnt say just "fine" but to express how she was really feeling (shes clever but im sure its not original)  she said "im fine! f**ked up insecure neurotic and emotional",0

you have to determine your skin type oily combo whatever to really pick the right otc products or else they dont help also dont switch products constantly it irritates skin and expect it to get worse before when you do start something new because your skin may freak at first like what is this goop lol if nothing worms see a dermatologist salicylic acid is made for acne,1
i have lost many friends i only really have one friend at the moment she used to be my occupational therapist and after treatment we became friends she is a friend like i have never had she would do anything for me my other friends turned their backs on me for many reasons 1 they couldnt handle my illness 2 they thought my suicide attempt was just to get attention 3 they didnt really care about me 4 i was putting more energy into the relationship than they ever did i miss having other friends as i dont go out allot as i suffer with social anxiety and bipolar depression so it would be nice if i had more ppl to communicate with and feel supported by but at least i have my folks and my one friend you have to weigh it all out and go from there it definitely isnt easy,0
i tend to do this on my partner best thing we do is put on something i love on netflix & snuggle up being there greatly comforts the pain gets overwhelming its never personal,0
i used to worry about what they give you to take but they are highly trained people who do know what they are doing so best to stick to them to ask questions as dangerous to listen to all different people as these are strong meds you cant just stop them they need lowering by the phychartrist,1
i was diagnoised with bi ploal manic depression with panic disorder my life was a roller coster and my poor family road it everyday with me even if they didnt want to i was put on medication that took serveral years to find a good combo that would at least get me some level of normalcy not everday is good i still have trouble going to places alone like the grocery store etc as a single woman now it has left me to become somwhat of a hermit i dont like leaving my home except to go to work (which of course i must do) but i dont date my friends have all gone away (mainly because i push them away) i still ride the roller coster but not as often my daughter can tell a difference and for me that is why i continue to take my medication and chose to live it is difficult i will say and some days i wonder how ive made it this far but you have to want to live i do it on my terms which is not always the right way in most peoples eyes but i am as happy as any bi polar manic depressed person can be keep trying everyday for the sake of your family because they love you and need you,0

your feelings are valid having a child can be overwhelming and scary even with help from the father and medication if you decide to keep the baby there will be challenges no matter what it can also rewarding in ways you cant imagine pregnancy is different for everyone however i cried all the time even for happy things i worried about everything i thought i was incapable of being a good mom i never asked for help either 6 years later i still have trouble asking for help even though my friends are more than willing i believe you can do this :) if you want to its also ok to look at adoption if you dont i personally dont think abortion is right but it is also an option if the baby isnt too far along im not here to judge no matter what you choose you must do what is right for you and you need to take care of yourself i did take an antidepressant during pregnancy and went to a therapist actually i still do both hiding all this only causes you to suffer more when i started therapy and started being open with my friends and family i found that several of them also had depression and anxiety and also needed help or emotional support as mothers not all of them but a good chunk all of a sudden i realized i had an entire support system right in front of me,1
didnt work for me made my anxiety worse,1
i found it helped me greatly when i had post natal depression it calmed me down more than anything nd anxiety was all pretty much gonei was on 50mg ns eventually it pooped out cause i didnt want to up it nd got pretty depressed it didnt boost me up anymore bur that was after 2 yrs,1
lack of sleep alone afterabot 70 hours can make you psychotic are you eating anything? drug induced sleep is an ok alternative for a while but i recently also had a sa and a loved one odd on mixing the scripts with the alcohol he was so desperate i would like to see you go get evaluated for an inpatient stay be safe get rest get on a schedule of sorts mine has been off for four or five years days without sleep then a week in bed no self care its a spiral please i care no one deserves to handle this alone no one derves this period go take some positive action go get help while you are still scared and motivated it can get better our mentlissues wax and wane take a chanc3 on the positive youve endured enough crap for now,0
i hate my meds weve been trying for years and just cant get it worked out my bain is just wore out and im tired of it but i am terrified to go off of them ive always b÷n medicated ugh,0
dont think im anxious anymore more fucking angry than anything else but now on meds and feel calm and at times depressed,0
you will only deal with this when you are ready to not before then the only way around the anxiety is head on into it the decision needs to be made as to which is going to hurt you worse talking about it and being brutally honest with yourself and your counselor or letting it continue to eat you up inside who cares what the counselor thinks about it personally you are paying them for their professional advice but it helps to find someone you feel comfortable with in the end you have nothing to lose by talking about it you are the one causing the anxiety to yourself not the event memories only have the power that you give them and truly cant hurt you take a leap of faith i had to and my life is so much better for it you can do it,1
ive been on 30mg and now on 60mg occasionally get anxiety but nothing severe unless i havent taken my meds cymbalta is to treat both depression and anxiety from what my gp advised when i was first put on it though,1
im always afraid of this,0

he needs to realize the difference between maintaining mental illness with meds and a junkie someone that is mentally ill wants to get better so they can maintain a quality of life and be as "normal" as possible and medication can help them do that while a junkie takes pills and meds to help them avoid dealing with life you sought help and ate getting more help that doesnt happen for someone that is faking it im wondering if you talk to your doctor about maybe explaining things to him he needs to realize that you need his understanding and support and negativity wont help you,1
youre describing me im on the ledge of anxious despair and suicide several times a day my anxiety twists through my chest like a knife killing me but it cant ive lived like this since i can remember my early teens but now i’m sixty i can function theyre the ghost i hide i wish my normalcy was as intense my wife and son are the candle keeping meaning in my life no matter how dark i feel i glance over to them i see through my despair theyre guiding my existence i wish peace for you i’ll never have it yet my feelings are my super power and i’ll never give them up i use no meds but meditation and long walks i wish i could feel your world through your heart,0

i put all my meds into containers every week so its laid out easy mornings are with coffee and night time is by the bed i also set and alarm for them on my phone just in case i also put my meds in different color containers orange for morning and sunrise blue for dark and sleep that way i never get confused,1
the depakote is most likely to help it is a mood stabilizer which is the hallmark of treatment for initial treatment for bipolar fluoxetine is an antidepressant based on my knowledge and experience i believe that antidepressants should not typically be prescribed for bipolar because it puts you at a higher risk of developing mania,1
anxiety yes i havehell it feels,1
i would start with your dr maybe you need a increase in doseor different medicine with your new life changes comes stress stopbreatheuse what you have learned keep your head up!,1
by submitting themselves to the biggest unknown to humankind? i tried to kill myself last year but i lived because i can still feed my baby daughter breakfast every morning i am very glad that i did not die of course in desperation our reason and logic and our vision can all abandon us but believe me and take this from a person who knows it can get better and you can take control you have to find your strength which means you look in the first place you last had it inside of yourself,1
 i didnt get a licences until i was 21 im almost 32 and can only drive in town limits on side roads without panic attacks so i have "routes" i take to get where i need to go at certain times when i know traffic is minimal aka agoraphobia btw population here is around 6000 town is literally like 5mines long max i have only driven on the highway twice since i started driving to test the amounts of anxiety and panic i get from the fast motion movement also not medicated besides as needed clonopin because my body reverses medication like magic passenger is twice as bad for me i usually always end up with a panic attack,1
yup that was me i got told if this is me on meds i was better off without them i wanted to give it more time and then the warnings at work and the car crash done then tried lamictal felt amazing within a week! day 6 rash started gave it a few more days but it got worse and my dr called me in immediately it was the bad one that can turn life threatening done again tried geodon next day 3 pancreatic episode (i have recurring pancreatitis) so done again,0
i dont know if theyll prescribe it where you are but i take hydroxyzine at night for my anxiety as it gets pretty bad throughout the night i can also take it during the day as needed,1

this is a poisonous and dangerous point of view and it does nothing but shame somebody who is bipolar well shame on anybody who has said that to you shame on them,0
my son is a comic and at times has panic attacks while on stage i dont know how he does it the audience doesnt ever know but his dad and i see it and feel so helpless for him,0

thank you paul its been a true struggle after i quite i was diagnosed bipolar 2,0
i take latuda at night because it makes me sleepy and xanax throughout the day for anxiety,1
you have a lot going on right now between the bipolar and teen adolescence one positive way to look at this is that you were diagnosed early so you can develop the right coping mechanisms that will hopefully help you live a good quality of life as an adult so to answer your question yes there is a good chance for things to get better i am sorry that you are having a hard time right now there is nothing wrong with being upset and your feelings are valid dont stop with therapy and medications you got this! better days to come for you! cassandra :),1
so things may have taken an even worse turn i just had a mental break down just now and well lets just say it was not a pretty sight i may have scared my family a little all i can say is it was well needed feeling that tiny bit better now but feelings dont change that easily :),0
feeling totally confused and overwhelmed with everything thats the only way i can describe this my niece has this condition is on meds to keep things stable she was very ill at one time and had to be in hospital for treatment,0

very inappropriate im disappointed even if youre a person of faith god is not the answer for a person with a biological illness shame on you,0

ptsd sucks they said i had it during my intake assessment but the psychiatrist dismissed it not sure why she asked me some trigger questions and i guess i didnt give an appropriate response although ive been plagued by being terrorized as a child i will definitely be getting a new psychiatrist thank you nick,0
my doctor had given me time that havent worked and the effexor was prescribed by a different doctor since i was so desperate ive select years upon years trying to get better and finding a good doctor is just as bad,1
i agree that exercise meditation yoga and positive thinking are good for mental health however there is more to mental health than exercise and positive thinking depression is real and can kill if not properly treated everyone responds differently gp generally are not knowledgeable about mental illness i was getting refills from mine and my meds actually should have been changed but she didnt have the expertise to treat me i had a spiral down hill with many trips to the hospital because i was so suicidal and mania so high mixed with anxiety it actually got much worse go see a psychiatrist counseling is helpful sometimes i get frustrated because i feel like the techniques are blaming me for being sick i think its learning to use them appropriately which is not always taught correctly,1

you have an illness that is trying to run your life and make you miserable are you on meds now? in therapy? if not please try to get help depression doesnt need a reason,1
please seek out a professional who knows more than wikipedia bullet points too many so called ptsd experts know absolutely nothing my closest attempt was one year ago on the 15th of this month instead i was involuntarily committed for 2 weeks had they took my history of managable panic attackt that happened on occasion caused by emotional abuse growing up constant bullying ems for 6 years which gives me constant flashbacks and nightmares due to a lot of horiffic stuff long story short had the hospital given me a brain scan they would have found ms and not given me a medication the month before that will make current symptoms a ton worse and how i had just realized recently? i was coming to terms with being a 6 year victim of sociopathic abuse they should have realized my ptsd was complex ptsd and i had my first ms attack because of those and other contributing factors my advice from experience is please get help immediately and make sure the dr knows more about ptsd than you do please take care of yourself you are more important to yourself than you realize and there are people who care deeply about you,1
bipolar/depression/anxiety open page please stop posting such small images - they show up really blurry and we cant read what they say!,1
its sucks relationships have failed because they start to think its only about sex and its not and then i have my down cycles where i dont even want to be touched and they take it personally i feel so ashamed trying to talk about because our culture teaches us that sex is taboo,0
hi vanessa its not something ive experienced myself it could be a nervousness/anxiety reaction like hands shaking or trembling legs although it is something you should mention to your doctor just so they can rule out any other cause if nothing else is causing it your therapist may be able to suggest something to help ~vw~,1
ive been told when im dealing with stress i have to try with some coping mechanism its easy for someone who has a normal brain but for us its trying to tell a deaf person they should try to listen ,0
dont feel bad guilty or scared its no good for you where you are i hope you do this amd start a new life for your self good luck xxx,0
and if your dr isnt helping dont hesitate to get a second opinion my psychiatrist took me completely off cipralex abilify and lorazepam and put me on venlafaxine and clonazepam instead with sublinox when necessary and im getting on much better,1

been in both the jaws of this monster both of them very frightening but praise god and the help of two very inspirational people who constantly shot at me with bullets of powerful positive reinforcement  and gratefully the correct blend of meds and very patient listeners one day i thought to myself l have to change the conversations ld been having with myself change my internal dialogue i was advised to find at least three things about myself that have merit/value or things i liked about myself tough one 1 even with the terrible highs and lows my superior at the military hospital where l worked once told me l have a charming disposition wow it stuck with me my ingenious and artistic gift :-o and my voice over the pa announcement system which gifts do you have? write them down beautiful hair beautiful smile? personality? the gifts/blessings must be there i promise people? those who love you matter and those who dont understand or love you? make like a duck and shrug them off your shoulders and out of your life dont waste a single moment trying to explain things be strong and resist reject every single negative thought  get up tomorrow morning forget every yesterday of sadness refuse to allow your mind to poison you anymore tell yourself out loud that i want to get better you can pick up the pieces little by little and take small but positive st,0
i was a very unhealthy 113 lbs when i started lithium and i also had thyroid issues before realizing i was bipolar i am 131 now after having been on the lowest dose of lithium but i feel human i eat better i am motivated to leave the house and be active (more so than i have been in years) i worry about you just stopping if i were to do that it would be hell for me i hope you find something that works ❤️,1
ohhhhh! beautifultalented funny robin so sadly badly missed from our world so clever you were at wearing the happy mask i can so totally relate on all levels  such a wickedly horrid thing is depressionanxiety and such  and sadly for robin a fight that he could no longer endure will never ever be forgotten for the happy he gave our souls ❤,1

i agree with eric that it is difficult to get off clonipin if felt like i needed more and more till i was taking 3 mg a day it took me 7 months to reduce the dose to 1/2 a mg in the morning my dad recently passed away so i went back up on the dose but am now weaning my self off it again do we ever not need a crutch in times of high anxiety? i dont know how "normal" people do it,0
i have hypersexuality its been a bit better with my pregabalin prescription it takes the edge off for me i go through phases of having a fairly normalish sex drive ( once a day ) which i class as  wanting  and then other phases which my sex drive is absurd  needing  it a few times a day if it dont get it at either stage i get angry upset i watch a lot of porn then i have the rough sex part of it i like being abused in the bedroom but according to the doctor thats a separate issue i have an emotionally damaging childhood the rough of it makes me feel relieved and less tense i guess everyone is different,0
if only all that crap worked you cant sleep you dont want to eator over eat and all wrong things comfort food talk to someone? people dont want to know about your anxiety issuesor so ive found so i keep to myself now & dont talk to anyone!,0
you need to look after yourself if hes not willing to see a psychiatrist or doctor you should risk your own mental well-being to help him hugs x,1
i know how u feel i feel like my meds are controlling my mania but because of that im just in a mildly depressed state all the time :( i hate it im so tired and unmotivated :( the problem is i go super paranoid and have to be hospitalized when the mania goes too far but yeah i would rather be manic than depressed any day the challenge is to find that healthy middle they call "normal" good luck congrats on getting back to work :) but please dont go off your meds keep working with your doctor and get counseling,0

my 34 year old son has come up with his own techniques when he is angry he holds up his hand like stop and that is our cue not to talk to him when he returns to us and starts talking then we know its safe to talk to him again when he gets anxious he rides stationary bike paces a lot does other yard work etc he used to write a journal which i do think is a great idea hope you can get to another dr quickly if you are in the us you might try calling mhmr here in texas or at least where we are they will treat you for free,1
just remember the page you are on and the people who are giving advice you are all he has and now the his mother has passed he is surely lost the trauma of losing her is most likely horrible for him as it is for you try to find this woman and explain the situation if you can  maybe just maybe she is ignorant of his disabilitys,0
dont hesitate to contact dr,0
sometimes its one breath at a time in order to walk through stressful times youre stronger than you think!,0
hi jenni! im on two types of seroquel i take 50mg slow release and 50mg of instant release i tried taking slow release in the morning (i take the instant release at night) and it just made me sooooo tired so i just started taking it at night with my other ones! works wonders how long have you been on seroquel? the first month or so for me was awful i had countless panic attacks and i was never happy eventually it worked out for me! hopefully it does for you too!! im no doctor but i hope it helps! good luck let me know how you go! xx,1
i never said anyone was a liar it was entirely read in some therapists have a view that their experience is all the knowledge needed to work with others take a theoretical approach while its true that someone with mdd doesnt commonly present with audio hallucinations it doesnt mean that a specialist who works more within experience than theory wouldnt contradict that statement and say that people with mdd do get audio hallucinations because in his experience he has treated many mdd patients with psychosis so which one is correct? neither because both are right in their own scope theory is usually more about general psychology so this is generally true; where as people learning from experience have their eye on a specific population and has specific intrests meaning they dont worry about general information but information specific to his clients,0
i am going to get some sensitive plant seeds and start growing themwhen i used the leaflets in my tea and water i drank throughout the daymy ex told me he saw a huge difference in meiam gonna do this ao i can get off medication cos it is soooooo not working for me eithersensitive plant is also known as tickle me plant or shy plant or sensitive weedwhits man has classifies it as a noxious weed but as we know most weeds have medicinal properties! !!!!!!,0
thank you! it is so hard to apply this to myself but its easy to be there for others if that makes sense  i dont want to make this post about me but i will say hilary fredman every day is a struggle to just get out if bed,0
you need to take care of yourself first with meds i know you dont mean it but it can be abusive and very confusing to a kid talk to her about the illness and get help my mom was bipolar which ruined my childhood and it still hurts 20 years after her death i will never forgive her for not taking the help when she was diagnosed,1
unfortunately for me nothing worked for my super anxiety as i call it i was prescribed valium 5mg 3 times daily and seroquel at least at night and when needed during the day no driving during the day though when on seroquel after years of trying this works for me,1
hi there so sorry to hear things are so difficult phew you have a lot going on no wonder you might be struggling forgive me but im uncertain if you are in the uk or us so not sure as to the support which is available to you firstly a little around bereavement loss and grief when someone has been a carer for any length of time if the person they are caring for dies this can leave a huge void for the bereaved not only can you grieve for them deeply regardless of the relationship but your whole purpose and role has disappeared overnight you provided such a valuable and worthwhile lifeline and service which you knew helped so much so when thats all gone it is perfectly feasible that you will literally feel redundant personal loss in any form can leave the bereaved feeling lost alone or abandoned caring for someone as much as you did can also mean the person left behind is just no longer needed dealing with grief for anyone can be so hard let along someone who may have other difficulties such as mental health problems the impact can be far more severe death is very hard to comprehend sometimes how can someone be there so close one day and so far away the next? we need logic in our lives to understand and make any sense death robs us of that recovery from the loss of a loved one and coming to terms with the grief is usually most effective if we can learn to manage the grief finding a way forward to build a new life with new purpose where you can feel needed once again and but holding onto those precious memories of our loved ones ive noticed many others have suggested good possible ways of moving forward a new interest putting your wonderful talents and qualities to a good and valuable use and to help you feel valued again so you can hopefully begin to feel as though you are providing a worthwhile service to someone or something in the case of a pet or animal charity there are so many deserving causes which im sure would love to have someone such as yourself volunteering when i was at an all time low my goal eventually was to do some worthwhile voluntary work get a meaningful job and to do a course to learn something new as well as several other things which would help such as exercise a healthy diet and sunlight etc none of these things happen overnight and to me it was small but significant steps towards an eventual goal its not easy of course i wont pretend it is but it is possible but you also need to lean on those who care and engage with outside help too if it is available ie professionals and charities sorry to run on not trying to preach just thinking of anything which might just help best wishes xx,0
i need to go to beacon and pick up my results! i did one too didnt like the psych or the people in the office so i found another and never looked back im struggling with meds now so im going to need to get those!,0
i believe it ive had so many shitty psychiatrists in the last twenty years in fact my last one who was really old okay told me on a wednesday that he was retiring; he was horrible anyway the most he ever saw me for was exactly eight minutes; on friday morning news there he was in orange being led into a courtroomget thisfor child pornography good doc huh ?,0
my daughter suffers from bpd and anxiety disorder which causes severe tourette symptoms in all the years and baskets of meds the only thing that has made a huge difference is cannabis oil its truly miraculous ps its now legal in my country even though started giving it to her long before,1
liz broughton may be because your work is stressful?,1
same here when i get out of routine and become ungrounded i struggle,0
typically there are side effects initially especially if you start on too high a dose but prozac is proven for anxiety and depression i wouldnt give up on it,1
it took me three attempts to find something which worked: sertraline the only downside was it gave me an upset stomach but the first drug turned me into a zombie the second made the anxiety worse like anything; some drugs work for some some dont and side-effects may affect one person but not another if it doesnt work for you try something else also most meds say not to just stop them but wean,1
ayewhat if u have bothconstant struggle for me ,0
everyone should be saying alive! youre here today still fighting and battling no bell rang yet if youve been battling as many years i have since i was 22 im 46 now still have terrible days i mean scary hearing voices seeing things thinking someone is watching me or following me it is scary very scary ill never get rid of this illness/disease i take everyday like its my last hope everything works out #livelovelaugh,0
that fuckers so called plan was to give me crippling anxiety god can kiss my ass,1
with bipolar if you tend to be depressed the majority of the time it is often misdiagnosed as major depression ive had some doctors (for short periods of time because of their short-sidedness) that argued with me that i did not have bipolar because they hadnt witnessed any mania/hypomania in the 2 visits over 8 weeks they had been seeing me the only medication you mentioned that i dont know much about is the neurontin the others you are on shouldnt have any adverse reactions with each other but that doesnt mean you wont have adverse reactions to them the doses of the others you are on are fairly low doses if you have been on them for several weeks at least and are still having the panic and other side effects talk to your doctor about adjusting dosages if you have just started on them give it a few weeks (unless the symptoms get unbearable/life threatening) for your body to adjust to them its very possible this just isnt a good combination for you nothing but time and trial and error can figure out what will work,1
understand all to well i have pstd and ocd and just found out a few weeks ago i have bipolar 2 and the meds i was taking for ocd is poison to take for people with bipolar :( i have been sick and begging for help for a few years couldnt understand what was going on thought i was going crazy i scared myself so bad i called crisis hotline and they got me in with in mins and talked to me and helped :) its not gone but i feel better and working oon getting well,1

brendan fry cause u overplayed disturbeds version,1
those who laughed dont truly understand what a real struggle this is,0
i really struggled with the idea that id have to take meds for the rest of my life to be normal its 35 years since my diagnosis and i still do sometimes remember that you dont suddenly have bipolar this isnt something new its just that now you have a name for it the meds arent so much about normality after all everyone is a little strange instead think of it as allowing you to function so you can be the best version of you i could wander around without my glasses despite being very short sighted its possible but would make my life so much more difficult instead i wear my glasses and ill have to wear them for the rest of my life this isnt really any different,0
i went from 800 mg to 1200 mg of lithium in addition to some other meds i found that lithium destroyed my stomach and even made it to where i couldnt leave the house for a few hours following taking my meds out of fear of not having a bathroom i have since figured out that i have to eat when i take it i found that it cant be a sugary snack but like actual food i also eliminated regular soda and that helped as well the big thing i have to watch for is getting dehydrated i can feel how much different it affects me while on lithium and when i have an issue i reach for something like pedialyte to help het a jump on balancing things out,1
