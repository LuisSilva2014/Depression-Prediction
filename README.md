# Predicting depression with Deep Learning.
This project is an improved version of a previous one that used a Logistic Regressor model from Sciki-Learn. This time, I'm using a Keras RNN to achieve the same task. Essentially I did feed the model with several depressive comments extracted from Facebook (previously labeled using topic modeling). In addition, there's a folder about how to deploy the model on AWS SageMaker; check it out!
